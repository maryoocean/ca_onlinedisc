    <title>CMV: Religion is just Peer Pressure from Your Parents</title>
    <original_poster>siddharth_pillai</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't think most people believe in their religion. Nor do they believe in the gods they worship. They simply believe in whatever their parents believe. If you're a theist reading this, ask yourself whether you'd still follow your current religion if your parents were Islamic?

You can speculate yourself, don't you think its more likely that you would be Islamic too? If your parents were Hindus, wouldn't you be a Hindu? If your great grandparents were Sikhs wouldn't your parents and in turn you also be a Sikh?

It may not be true for all but its true for an overwhelming majority of people.

Edit: I'm getting some answers asking about people who convert or have non religious parents, my views don't apply to these people</original_post>

    <text>I know a lot of people who are what would be called "born again".  Their parents aren't religious, but somewhere along the way they decided to see what was out there and got involved with a particular church.

So no, religion isn't "just peer pressure from your parents".</text>

    <text>That's why I included that last line. This doesn't apply to those people.</text>

    <text>So you believe that billions of people don't actual believe in the religion they practice?</text>

    <text>I personally couldn't find a flaw in my view which is why I asked it here to see if someone else can</text>

    <text>Lets start with the basics - what do you believe religion is? Is it just a belief in God, is it the actual practice of worship?</text>

    <text>I guess the second definition is more accurate but I'm fine with either</text>

    <text>So once people are no longer living with their parents - why would they continue doing so?</text>
    </comment>
  <comment id="41881379663.0" user="siddharth_pillai" delta="False">
    <text>Because they believe in their religion too. But my claim is that they would still simply be following their parents' religion. If their parents had different beliefs, they would too.</text>

    <text>But wouldn't it be the case that if it was peer pressure, they wouldn't believe it themselves and are just doing what their parents say? So in that case if they believe in their religion even after no longer being watched by their parents, that it isn't peer pressure?</text>
