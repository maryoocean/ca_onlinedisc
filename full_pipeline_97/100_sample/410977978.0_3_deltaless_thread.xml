    <title>CMV: I have no faith in humanity and we all deserve to go extinct.</title>
    <original_poster>rfreymuth</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't even know exactly what to say about anything in relation to this topic. Now, I have no experience of any actual human beings physically hurting me or anything else that would typically make someone lose faith in humanity, but what they did collectively was enough to make ME do so!

First, and most importantly, the election of Donald Trump. Ever since the beginning of his campaign, my parents had been constantly talking about how Trump was so stupid that there would be absolutely no chance that he would win the election based on how people really do think, and based on that, I made a vow to myself that I would lose faith in humanity if he won. I did. I now believe that humanity needs and deserves to go extinct because of this.

But that's not the only reason why I believe we all need and deserve to go extinct. The other reason is the inevitable box office success of The Emoji Movie. Ever since its ANNOUNCEMENT, I thought that it was the worst idea in the history of movies and even the greatest amount of care put into it would still make me never want to watch it. Well, obviously the movie did not have any effort at all, and nearly nobody liked it. I was really very happy about that. But the thing that made me double down on my belief of humanity's extinction being deserved was the fact that it will become a box office hit!

I can't think of any other examples I have gone through right now, but I hope you get what I'm saying! I actually don't care if the World War I Christmas Truce makes someone else restore faith in humanity, or any of the other "being kind to your enemies" scenarios in big-name wars did the same, or anything else that would restore faith in humanity. The fact still remains...

How could humanity be so goddamn STUPID!!! First, the election of a bully, troll, and CRIMINAL as President of the United States, and now the inevitable box office success of the worst idea in the history of movies, which will result in other equally bad ideas like "Damn Daniel: The Movie"!

As a result, we DESPERATELY need to go extinct! We fucking deserve it!</original_post>

    <text>Not every person on Earth voted for Donald Trump. Not every person on Earth went to see the Emoji Movie. Heck, most of the people who support the president think it's right, not because they "hate" people.

Anyways, humanity didn't elect the President, or create/watch the Emoji movie. More people didn't do either than the people who did. Yeah, people on Earth do stupid things sometimes but as a whole we aren't all bad.

Sony is making a "meme movie" apparently, don't cast your judgement for the worst movie idea yet</text>

I know that, but the reason why I believe humanity needs to die is not because they hate each other, but because they are DUMB! Just so fucking dumb!</text>

    <text>In terms of raw numbers, more Americans voted to *not* have Trump be president, to say nothing of the billions of humans outside the US.</text>

No, they're white nationalists, racists, proto-fascists, and all other sorts of scum.  </text>

    <text>It's true that most of the people you described voted Trump, most of his voters are people who genuinely think he was better than his opposition. Like if Trump was 0 and Clinton was -1 in their minds.

I know plenty of people who only voted Trump because he was the only way to stop Hillary from becoming President.</text>
