    <title>CMV: The War On Drugs failed due to the punishments not being severe enough</title>
    <original_poster>Blood_tree</original_poster>
    <original_post>The War on Drugs could have went significantly better had the DEA been able to request harsher sentences for distribution. Specifically corporal punishment and public executions for distribution would have made the drug problem in the United States negligible had they been enforced. Prison sentences cause people to disassociate the punishment from the crime due to their lengthly and impersonal nature and by contrast caning can be done in full very soon after the crime has been commited and is very personal and intense despite being on a whole less severe than a prison sentence. Public execution within a year of the crime is also a good measure since it will save money (we will be reducing the amount of appeals to one) and it will serve as a vivid denunciation of drug distribution and prevent perpetrators from reoffending.

    <text>The war on drugs has failed because the DEA is unable to attack the demand of drugs. They have only been able to attack the supply of the drugs. And when there is a demand, there will always be a supply, regardless of the risks, dangers, and evil that must be done to manufacture, transport and sell the supply the demand wants. 

Inflicting harsher punishments for distributes will only increase they prices of drugs, therefore giving the suppliers more power. 

And if we look at history; the more power the government has, the more the citizens will retaliate, then government will be abolished and replaced as it as before. 

&amp;gt;Public execution within a year of the crime is also a good measure

If government doesn't take the right steps in order to avoid every wrongful prosecution, the people will soon revolt.

The only way to win any kind of war is to grant people liberty and property rights. </text>

It doesn't increase their power since when drugs are prohibitively expensive they won't have a market.

This is nothing to do with property rights nor is it to do with liberty, it is just to do with having consequences for your actions.

Have you seen the demand for illegal drugs on the internet? Where there is a demand, there will be a supply. You have to take out both to get rid of the market. No government can get rid of a market.

&amp;gt;Singapore and Francoist Spain

Those people don't have guns, Americans have guns and they outnumber the government.

The war on drugs has everything to do with liberty and property rights. Before the war on drugs, there wasn't a constant war on the people. People had the right to choose to do drugs or sell drugs. People had the right to own drugs if they wanted to. The government collected less taxes from everyone because the government didn't need to have a huge justice system to prosecute people who do not infringe on the rights of anyone else. </text>

The government can get rid of a market. They will just search packages and if someone has drugs in a package they will get killed for trafficking.

Do you really think that a bunch of handguns are going to stop predator drones. Nazi Germany knew that people owning small arms was not a threat to the government hence why they liberalized gun laws.

The social detriment of drugs makes it worthwhile to have law enforcement target it. You can make the same argument for everything that it should be legalized.</text>

So what about personal deliveries?

I should have told you this earlier, but I'm a US combat veteran. I can really get into detail about how a few goat fuckers in the mountains have held its own against the full power of the US military. US citizens are better armed than those goat fuckers, and they have a home field advantage, so yes. US citizens could win a war with it's own government.

I believe government should do as it promised in the Constitution: "insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence,
promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty." Enforcement of victimless crimes really throws a wrench in the gears of America. </text>

People will be searched when they enter the country.

There wouldn't be a significant approval rating for the war against the government if the only problem was that the criminal justice system was being harsher but few people saw a real decline in their quality of life. The approval rating would be far lower than the approval rating of the insurgents in the middle east. The American military will also have a home field advantage so they will be more able to effectively stop the insurgents.

The United States has an outdated constitution which does not accurately reflect what a state should do especially in the modern age. It is good that the government ignores it.</text>
