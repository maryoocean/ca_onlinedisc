It hurts me to hear people demonize farmer based on information that is clearly biased, extremely exaggerated or down right falsified. \\n\\nAt all these places the animals seem perfectly content. They all had plenty of room to move around, were kept in optimized climate conditions, had unlimited supply of water and food that is formulated to have all the vitamins and minerals they need and they get regular attention from veterinarians who look for any aberration from perfect health. Stress is very bad for the quality of meat produced so farmers/ranchers have a big incentive to keep these animals as happy and comfortable as possible.\\n\\nWith these ideal conditions they have shown to have lower rates of disease, mortality and pathogens that end up in your meat than free range. A lot of that is because they’re not walking around in their own waste. Disease is also more easily transmitted back and forth with outside critters in free range. \\n\\nAntibiotic are a big issue but it\\'s not as straight forward as it\\'s made out to be. The FDA highly regulates the levels that go into animals and animals are regularly tested by vets to make sure they are where they need to be. These animals are not like humans. They can’t tell you they are sick. It may be days before they start showing signs and by then they could have passed it on to the entire flock/herd. It is primarily a preventative measure. Antibiotics used for growth are being phased out. No steroids or hormones are ever given to chickens or pigs. The ones given to cattle have shown not to affect the human physiology or to be in such low levels that it is negligible. (estrogen {ng/500g} in tofu 113,500,000 while in beef 7)\\n\\nLastly, for pigs, gestation cages are for their own good. Like many animals, pigs establish a hierarchical social order when mixed together. When sows are in groups, dominant sows tend to act aggressively and can even harm their own babies. They are only kept in these cages for a fraction of their lives until they can be re-integrated.\\n\\nI realized I made a lot of claims there.

Maybe I just havent seen a real factory farm but I got the impression that the majority of animals were grown in this manor. Perhaps there are much larger locations but I would need to see evidence that they operate in a different way than these places. I dont see why they would.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>You have not seen a real factory farm. They have such shit conditions because they want as much product as quickly as possible. These farms are not ones you\\'d be allowed in.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>Have you seen a real factory farm? Do you know there are shitty conditions or are you just assuming? There are a lot of reasons they dont let people in(a lot of them actually do) such as not bringing in more sources of contamination. A lot of activist are also looking for ways to intentionally make farmers look bad. If I was them I wouldnt want people coming in and exploting me like that.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>I\\'ve not, you\\'re right. But I\\'ve seen pictures (though those are mitt unbiased). I\\'m just saying they\\'re very different from rural area medium sized farms because there\\'s a lot more in the way of livestock and a lot more in the way of cutting corners.

I believe that to be true.\\n\\nThink of the problems of the past and of the present. In America, 150 years ago there was slavery. After that, there was segregation and the conditions of life for black Americans was hardly improved until the 1920s, but it was improved, and it has improved since then and it will continue to improve. The arc is long, yes, but eventually justice is achieved. \\n\\nWhat you have to understand is that in today\\'s society there is so much abundance. New farming techniques and water irrigation make it so we can feed the entire planet and then some. The presence of starvation in poor countries is because we do not yet know how to efficiently allocate resources to prevent that kind of death and suffering. But we are getting closer. By almost any metric, this is the best time in recorded history to be alive. More people are living happy, healthy, long lives than at any other point ever.\\n\\nProgress cannot be stopped for long. We\\'ll find the technology to decrease our imprint on the global environment at a useful scale. If people seem unwilling to convert to solar energy or wind or whatever else would work towards that today, it is because the technology has not quite caught up to the problem yet. But we have achieved many greater things than creating a more efficient car or a better system of irrigation or of lighting.\\n\\nAs for religious conflict, one reason it may seem so prevalent in the modern era is because it makes for interesting news. News companies know that that kind of issue sells, and they report on it every time. But the conflict today is nowhere near the level it used to be in the time of the crusades, or even in the 1940s. Prosperous countries have progressed a long way on getting rid of racism, and sexism, and religious intolerance. More work needs to be done, and it will, but this is not cause for alarm but rather cause for hope.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>In fact, cause for hope lies within your own statement:\\n\\n&gt; We have 2000+ years of recorded history to learn from as a species. Every variant of evil is recorded to be learned from: totalitarianism, terrorism, communism, imperialism, witch hunts, library burnings, genocides etc. \\n\\nAs few as 70 years ago there were dozens of totalitarian or authoritarian regimes in place. Today there are only a handful, and life in many of them is as good as in the most prosperous nations a few decades past. Consider Italy, Germany, Russia, pretty much all of Africa and South America, and even in the United States, government has become more accountable as a result of history. It doesn\\'t happen fast a lot of the time, but it happens.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>Italy and Germany are certainly good cases. But from my understanding although life is relatively good for Russians and Americans, the governments they elected (although essentially have no real control over), are perpetuating the problems of the world. Including building and selling weapons, destroying the environment and destabilizing other nations.\\n\\nIt seems to me life has always been relatively good for a small handful of humanity (in ancient times - greece, rome, parts of china. Then Britain/Spain etc.) And perhaps that handful is increasing over time, but I\\'m not really convinced of that. Because with all the advancements you pointed out have come nuclear weapons, heavily militarized borders (Pakistan-India for example), guerrilla conflicts and massacres on a scale that never would have been possible before (Africa). My understanding is large parts of the world are still in conflict. It\\'s been decades since World War II and yet the intolerance between east asian countries doesn\\'t seem to have subsided much.\\n\\nI realize it\\'s unfair to simply point out all the bad things and ignore the good things.\\nI\\'m not wholly unconvinced by your argument because you make good points about the long arc of justice and environmental technologies.\\nBut I still see the history of the world as sinusoidal rather than a long arc towards justice.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>Check out this article: http://io9.com/5920871/how-we-died-200-years-ago-compared-to-how-we-die-today\\n\\nPeople live longer today than at any point in the past.\\n\\nI\\'ll ask one question. Would you feel more secure in your livelihood or quality of living at any time in human history than today? I certainly wouldn\\'t, and I see only greater possibility for this to improve in the future.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>Yes but that is because we live in the current garden of Eden of humanity. Although the Greeks certainly didn\\'t live as long as us I can\\'t help but imagine they must have pondered similar things to what I\\'m pondering now and come up with the answer you\\'ve given. Not that it\\'s entirely wrong. But for every non-greek was it true? And what of the 2000 years of human history that followed?\\n\\nI certainly would not want to live in most of the middle east, or most of africa or south america or south east asia. Would you?</comment>\\n'}],\n",

              "     'content': '<original_post>I\\'m not here to argue whether Trump will win the election, I\\'m here to argue that it may not matter whether he does.\\n\\nRight now, what is happening in Portland is what I\\'ve come to understand through observation as Trump \"flexing\" against the barriers that constrain him. No one has been permanently harmed by federal agents purely because that would be too big of a step, too early. He is normalizing the relatively minor violence of terrorizing protesters without actually charging them, and priming the GOP base that supports him to readily accept more severe violence against those that do not support him.\\n\\nThis kind of flexing has gotten Trump really far. He throws something out that sounds insane at first and lets people digest it. Then he does a relatively minor version of it. Once that is normalized, he ups the ante.\\n\\nThe one that worries me the most is his continuous teasing over whether he will accept the election results, and casting doubt on the validity of the election in general. This is coupled with the fact that he still has four months to look at polls, reflect that he is losing, and decide that he must maintain his power undemocratically if necessary. Even if he doesn\\'t come up with a plan to do so, now, there will still be a two-month gap until Biden\\'s reelection that is usually expected to serve as a nice buffer for an orderly transition of power. I know I\\'ve mentioned plans, but Trump doesn\\'t need a plan, here. All he has to do is say: \"No.\" At this point, all the resources of the federal government will still be under his control, and his supporters will have already been primed to accept violence toward protesters.\\n\\nFor the purpose of this view, I don\\'t need Trump to successfully install fascism in the US. If he is removed through force, I will still consider myself \"right\" in the sense that a peaceful election was not enough. My view will be changed if I\\'m led to believe that Trump will lose the presidency without necessitating violence, or inciting it for his benefit.\\n\\nEDIT: I have already awarded Deltas to some people who argued in good faith. Starting now, I can\\'t promise that I will respond to everyone, but I definitely will no longer engage with anyone who argues with me on bad faith, or uses personal insults. Thanks to everyone who has presented good arguments.</original_post>\\n\\n<comment idx=1>&gt;At this point, all the resources of the federal government will still be under his control\\n\\nNo they aren\\'t.  There are numerous checks and balances that any President has to content with and frankly he would need the military on his side to pull off what you are suggesting.   Trump has been fighting elements inside even his own branch since he was inaugurated.  \\n\\nConsidering the numerous examples of general\\'s pushing back against him for relatively minor stuff compared to what you are suggesting there is just no way that Trump could just say \"No\" about being removed as President.\\n\\nYou are vastly overestimating the amount of support that would exist from both his government and his base for bucking the constitutional mandated transition of power.\\n\\nYour contention that all he has to do is say \"no\" just isn\\'t true at all.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>So yes, the military COULD forcibly remove him. In fact I consider that to be one of the extremely likely results. That\\'s why I said that I won\\'t really be proven wrong if he\\'s removed, but force is necessitated.\\n\\nBut as far as anyone BUT the military, I believe that the GOP would back him. They make a show of \"whispering doubts\" whenever he does something sketchy, but they are always there to have his back in the end.\\n\\nSo yeah, I absolutely believe it\\'s military force or bust. And I worry about how easy it will be for him to call it a coup.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>&gt;So yes, the military COULD forcibly remove him.\\n\\nThere would be no need for the military to remove him.    Once Biden is inaugurated he would simply instruct the white house security to remove him as any other unwanted person from the white house that wouldn\\'t leave.     \\n\\n&gt;But as far as anyone BUT the military, I believe that the GOP would back him.\\n\\nWhat actions or statements from any GOP member in congress would lead you to believe they would support any action this extreme?    There are numerous examples of GOP members going against Trump for things way more minor compared to going against the peaceful transition of power.     The GOP is anything but in lockstep with Trump.\\n\\nThis is off topic to my post though.   I directly challenged your assertion that Trump has control of all the resources of the federal government that would enable such a scheme to where he could just will it himself by saying \"no\" to leaving.   You did not address my argument.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>The truth is that you cannot talk about Trump\\'s power without talking about the unconditional support that the GOP has given him.\\n\\nAnd it *is* unconditional. Anyone who would be willing to stand against him in any context voted \"yes\" to remove him from office, because of how obviously deserving it was. Surprise, Romney was the only Republican.\\n\\nI do believe that they dislike him behind closed doors. I also believe that they fight him on the minor things, and not the major ones, because they can get away with fighting him on the minor issues.\\n\\nSo here is what happens, in my mind (most likely). Trump says \"No.\" There is an entire congressional kerfuffle over it. Democrats say that this is ridiculous, as they do. Republicans join in with Trump to cast doubt on the election. Because the house is dem and the senate is gop congress is rendered neutral, and therefore ineffective. Trump writes up desperate executive orders specifically meant to prevent Biden from taking the white house. Trump finally goes out, but he goes out escorted by federal enforcers.\\n\\nNow, this is all assuming that a free and fair election is allowed to take place in the first place, which is something I haven\\'t explained yet, but I think it\\'s an equally likely possibility that he could choose to compromise that well before any of this happens.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>&gt;The truth is that you cannot talk about Trump\\'s power without talking about the unconditional support that the GOP has given him.\\n\\nExcept that isn\\'t truth.   Trump has been rebuked numerous times by the GOP and there are even Republicans planning to speak at the DNC.    Claiming there is unconditional support is baseless.\\n\\n&gt;Now, this is all assuming that a free and fair election is allowed to take place in the first place, which is something I haven\\'t explained yet, but I think it\\'s an equally likely possibility that he could choose to compromise that well before any of this happens.\\n\\nThe federal government controls very little of the election process which is actually controlled by local and state governments.    How exactly is Trump going to corrupt that process nationwide with so many independent entities?\\n\\nWhich again goes back to my original argument that you are still not addressing about how Trump does not control the resources needed to pull off this kind of coup you are proposing.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

              "     'content': '<original_post>Kamala Harris was recently selected as Biden\\'s running mate, and it re-sparked a common misunderstanding of the Constitution. The definition of \"natural born citizen\". Clearly, Kamala Harris is eligible.\\n\\nJohn McCain, however, was not so clearly a \"natural born citizen\" as he had been born in the Panama Canal Zone to two US citizens. It was contentious enough of an issue that the Senate passed a resolution saying he was eligible. Specifically, McCain was born to two US citizens who were overseas at the direct orders of the US govt. If McCain was ineligible then every child born to US servicemembers overseas would be ineligible and most people agreed that this was not the founders intent.\\n\\nHowever, Rafael \"Ted\" Cruz was born to an American and a Cuban while they worked in Canada for a private company. If Ted Cruz is eligible to be a US president, then basically anyone who has a claim to citizenship is eligible, even if they have never lived in the United States.\\n\\n*Example: A young woman is born in China. Her mother is American, her father is Chinese. She lives her entire life in China, but claims dual citizenship for legal purposes. At the age of 42, she decides to move to the United States. She becomes a popular politician and runs for President, only 14 years after being elected to the US House of Representatives.*\\n\\nWould she be eligible? This seems like the exact scenario the founders were trying to prevent. Someone with loyalties to another country taking the reins of power of the USA.If Ted Cruz is eligible, then this woman would be eligible. At that point, why wouldn\\'t we extend the presidency to citizens like Arnold Schwarzenegger?\\n\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-born-citizen\\\\_clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-born-citizen_clause)\\n\\nEdit: adjusted for the residency requirement\\n\\n**For all mentions of the Nationality Act of 1790.**The law, as written in 1790 said the following:\\n\\n* Only free white males could become citizens\\n* Provided, that the right of [citizenship](https://immigrationhistory.org/item/1790-nationality-act/#) shall not descend to persons whose fathers have never been resident in the United States\\n\\nFirst, we obviously don\\'t still have this law on the books. It was fully and totally cancelled and the phrase about \"natural born citizen\" was removed. You can\\'t point to a law that is not currently applicable as your definition. They clearly felt the need to define the term, and they later rescinded that definition\\n\\nFurther, I think you could make a strong argument that it only applied to children of the father with that definition. This fits with what I have read of citizenship laws in Europe, which stated that citizenship status descended from the paternal line. (I know this because it was a big controversy when people started raping slaves, as it would make the children citizens and free. Most countries made a law explicitly exempting this rule in the case of slave-master relationships)\\n\\n**Naturalized vs natural born**\\n\\nThe term naturalized wasn\\'t created until the 1940s, when international travel became much more common. The term presently means \"conferred after birth\", but that term was not used during prior to that period. In fact, \"natural born\" was used in the US and the UK to imply a citizen granted citizenship by their birth in the USA.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;</original_post>\\n\\n<comment idx=1>IT all depends on how you define natural born citizen. Conventionally, it is that that person has citizenship at the time of birth either by being born on US soil or certain holdings. Alternatively, the citizenship can be bestowed via blood. You cannot be 1/2 a citizen, either you are or are not. Either that citizenship was bestowed at birth or it was not. \\n\\nCruz\\'s father was a citizen, therefore he has citizenship bestowed at birth, thus is a natural born citizen. In the scenario you described, that woman would be eligible. However, its with the caveat that she wins. Even hints of ineligibility bring scandal, it would be very hard for her to take the presidency after living abroad for most of her life.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>Ted\\'s mother. But I get your point.  \\n\\n\\nBut then why was there even a \"birther\" controversy or a controvery around McCain?</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>There was a controversy for two reasons.\\n\\n1. People are idiots and looking for any reason to discredit political opponents\\n2.

The definitions of natural born citizen are pretty established in that you can be born with citizenship in outside the US as long as one parent is American.

              "     'content': '<original_post>E3 took place the past couple of days, and of the various bits of news from the event, Ubisoft announced their Assassin\\'s Creed title. I\\'m wholly indifferent to the Assassin\\'s Creed games, but apparently this game features 4 person local multiplayer and only includes a slate of male characters. As a result of this news, some of my feminist former-friends posted articles to this effect: http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/11/5799386/no-female-characters-in-assassins-creed-unity-too-much-work\\n\\nI\\'m not going to weigh in on the truth of Ubisoft\\'s claims particularly, whether or not their claims were justified, or whether any of the views held by either side is right and just. The general consensus among the feminism crowd seemed to be along the lines that:\\n\\n* 1. There are many sexist stereotypes prevalent in video games, possibly moreso in mainstream titles, and particularly noticed (by the feminists) are those stereotypes concerning women.\\n* 2. There is a large and substantial base of female gamers, many of whom would presumably enjoy games that break stereotypes and employ strong female lead characters\\n* 3. Many popular games today don\\'t necessarily serve female gamers so well\\n\\nI\\'m not going to suggest that feminists shouldn\\'t complain (well, I might a little), but from my vantage point that\\'s pretty much all I see get done. If you actually believe 1, 2, and 3 above, then there might be a GOLDEN MARKET OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU and you should invest your ranting energy into developing for this female gamer market (it\\'s also overwhelmingly likely that this is, in fact, already being done and I\\'m just not particularly aware of it). Barriers to entry have probably never been lower to go develop for almost any platform you like, and indy games that hit it big have the opportunity to hit it REALLY big. You could make the video game equivalent of \"Orange is the New Black\" and have millions of loving, adoring fans who will cheer and talk about how you helped bring women into the video game mainstream. And hey, money!\\n\\nSadly, this attitude didn\\'t much win over my feminist friends, who more or less told me to shut up and go fuck myself. So... yeah, I fail to see the problem with my thinking.

These are two very different things.  \\n\\nI am sure there is a market for games oriented to women, but actually this goes against a moderate feminist\\'s principles, what a reasonable feminist is criticizing is that the same games could exist without sexist stereotypes, that\\'s all. This means they are geared to all sorts of people regardless of gender.  Gender should not be an issue unless there is a biological or objective justification: pregnancy, pornography, history, etc.  \\n\\nI am not defending a stupid person that tells you to shut up and fuck off, this is stupid regardless of what they think, I am just clarifying a confusion I seem to see in your position.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>I\\'m just going to point out how futile this is then. The gaming market is just that, a market. If you don\\'t intend to participate, no developer will likely care for what you have to say. For better or for worse, the only way you\\'re going to change how women are portrayed in video games is to make a market that will listen to women, and that means making games for women.\\n\\n(Also, I find it a bit on the social control side of things when you barge into a community you aren\\'t apart of and tell them to act a certain way and then leave.)</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>I think you are mixing two things.  No-one is denying the free-market right to develop and publish the game you want.  The economical argument is sound. \\n\\nThere is the moral argument of a social damage caused by sexist games.  This is not refuting the economical argument, it\\'s another layer.  \\n\\nI don\\'t need to be a games developer to criticize games, in the same way I don\\'t have to be a smoker or doctor to criticize smoking ad campaigns.  \\n\\n&gt; the only way you\\'re going to change how women are portrayed in video games is to make a market that will listen to women, and that means making games for women.  \\n\\nThis is not true, removing sexist stereotypes can appeal to women and men, whereas designing games for women should mostly appeal to women.  \\nPlus, many women are sexist too, it\\'s not just a male-generated issue, and drawing attention to this is beneficial to all.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>Oh, I wasn\\'t trying to make a moral argument either way. I was just saying it isn\\'t going to realistically happen unless they have market influence.\\n\\n&gt;I don\\'t need to be a games developer to criticize games, in the same way I don\\'t have to be a smoker or doctor to criticize smoking ad campaigns.\\n\\nThe difference between criticizing smoking and criticizing sexualized video game characters is that we already presuppose that video games are a fantasy and are prone to being unrealistic. \\n\\nYou\\'d might as well be making the argument that video game violence makes people more violent. What makes sexualized characters different is that it\\'s just distasteful, like video game violence against puppies where market forces indicate that people like violence against puppies. \\n\\nAnd really, I\\'m not sure you can say these characters do any more damage then the constant sexualization in other parts of culture. Whereas when you consider smoking, it is known to cause bodily harm.\\n\\n&gt;This is not true, removing sexist stereotypes can appeal to women and men, whereas designing games for women should mostly appeal to women.\\nPlus, many women are sexist too, it\\'s not just a male-generated issue, and drawing attention to this is beneficial to all.\\n\\nThe thing is though, female gamers are a niche part of the more, dare I say, \"hardcore\" section of gaming. You have a point in that games can be neutrally appealing, but that really wasn\\'t my point. I was trying to point out that you have to be a market force, spouting off political opinions into a community you aren\\'t apart of will get you nowhere fast. More female-friendly games will come mainly because of female gamers, not because of some feminist campaign against the gaming industry.\\n\\nTo address the second point there though, I am aware women can be sexist, but it isn\\'t like there is abundant female sexists in the gaming community. Now I can say that male characters can be \"sexualized\" in a way, either as per literally or by simply being unrealistic and therefore perpetuated social ideas of masculine power. However, I don\\'t think many gamers really care about that department and neither do I. It doesn\\'t change the fact that games are fantasy.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>We agree mostly, so I\\'ll focus where we disagree only.  \\n\\n&gt; What makes sexualized characters different is that it\\'s just distasteful  \\n\\nNot really, it makes people used to sexist stereotypes and this has a social impact, that\\'s why it\\'s not being called \"distasteful stereotypes\" but \"perpetuation of sexist stereotypes\".  \\n\\n&gt; spouting off political opinions into a community you aren\\'t apart of will get you nowhere fast  \\n\\nI think the objective is not to bring down the sexist games, but to point out how these stereotypes come out again and again and make gamers notice them and see how uncreative they are, and this might incrementally persuade gamers to appreciate more sexually neutral stereotypes and thus impact the market in the long run. It\\'s like pointing out how fast food abuse makes children and people fat, the attack is not meant to cause people to go on a diet, but to gradually make it known that weak willpower when eating does not go unnoticed.  \\n\\n&gt; male characters can be \"sexualized\" in a way  \\n\\nSure, but society still gives males the upper hand, so no damage done, unlike perpetuating sexist stereotypes that are unfair towards women.  It\\'s like having all evil characters have british posh accents, you won\\'t see complaints by the royal family, but if all evil characters were black you\\'d have an uproar!</comment>\\n'}],\n",

              "     'content': '<original_post>Hello! I saw that there was a post about an incel that hit pretty big, so if you guys are willing to actually talk to us, I think that’s cool. I read that post, and I came out hating that guy. He seemed like a dick, only caring about sex and treating women like objects, while I actually really want to have a loving and caring relationship with a girl. I value cuddling more than sex, to put it plainly. In fact, I don’t really care about sex that much, unless my hypothetical gf wants it herself. \\n\\nAnyway, one of my biggest problems with the world, obviously, is that women won’t date me. Something that really bothers me is that women take for granted so many things. So many women find it normal to have multiple guys perusing them, and complain when they don’t perfectly match their standards. Of course, I don’t blame them for that at all, after all, I’ll be the first to admit that most modern women are fucking garbage, so there’s nothing wrong with women rejecting a guy. However, I just hate how they are so rude and label guys as creeps for just having genuine feelings. If a girl confessed her feelings to me, even if I didn’t give a shit about her, I would really appreciate it and be incredibly flattered. \\n\\nSomething I also hate is the hypocrisy of women. And there’s a lot of it. One of the greatest is how they condemn misogyny and abuse, yet always go after men who are abusive and sexist. Every fucking time, like clockwork. So many damn women have a story of their abusive ex boyfriend, which I don’t blame them for, but if they are so willing to date guys like that, why am I single? Why are assholes so successful, when literally all I’ve ever wanted is to love and cherish a girl? So many girls say how much they hate things that guys do, such as ignoring them or acting unfaithfully... so why don’t you just date me? I’ve always been kind and respectful to everyone my whole life, including women, and it goes unnoticed completely. I don’t expect to be rewarded for kindness, but it just hurts when people who are rude and disrespectful are rewarded more. Either women actually do like abusive and misogynistic men and are lying, are willing to excuse those traits if the man is attractive, or are just really bad at detecting red flags. All seem likely and none are very nice. \\n\\nAlso, it bothers me that so many women are not virgins. Like, I’m 17, and I’ll be 18 relatively soon. Are there any virgin girls my age left? I know sex your first time supposedly sucks, but I want my first time to also be her first time, and for us both to be teenagers. I’ve fantasized about that a lot. Probably won’t happen though.\\n\\nAlso, I’ll get some arguments out of the way here:\\n-Why a women want to date you if you are a incel??\\nIve never told anyone about my thoughts in real life. Just on this anonymous throwaway account on reddit. And no, they can’t sniff my inceldom. I’m very kind to women irl, if I even talk to them at all.\\n-Why don’t you just take a shower and go to the gym?\\nI have good hygiene and while I’m not in perfect shape, I’ve started going to the gym with a friend. Surprisingly enough, we aren’t all neckbeard caricatures.\\n\\nI could probably say more, but that’s most of it. If I think of more I’ll add it later. Can you guys change my mind? I realize that women can’t read my mind to tell I’m an incel, but maybe they would like me more if I wasn’t. Just maybe. Don’t want to be a white Knight or anything.\\n\\nEDIT: Forgot to mention this: Most girls are boring. I could never date a girl who doesn’t share my interests, or isn’t at the very least willing to try out the things I like. I mean, what do most girls like nowadays? Tiktok? Painting there fingernails? Idk</original_post>\\n\\n<comment idx=1>Why do you actually want a relationship with a girl? You’ve really just insulted women as a whole this entire thread while still arguing that you so badly want a relationship and would treat a girlfriend so well and respect her so much. People generally want a partner that wants to date them, not just a generic member of their gender. \\n\\nMost women aren’t going to feel special because you’ll date them since their female, moderately good looking, a virgin, and give you the time of day. You need to get to know them and find someone you want to date because they’re funny, smart, kind hearted, have similar interests something about who they are as a person. They also have to like something unique about who you are as a person, not disrespectful isn’t enough.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>First of all, I hate most people. I just don’t want to date guys, and I have friends who are males so I hate guys a little less. Most people are horrible monsters though. \\n\\nAnd, I think if women were to look past my looks and liked quieter guys, I think I have a lot to offer. I guess I don’t know what girls like though.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>Girls all like different things because they’re different people. Until you treat them like individuals it doesn’t really matter what you have to offer. If the otherwise perfect guy showed up on my doorstep but the only reason he was there is he thought I was pretty and less of a bitch that most girls I wouldn’t be interested.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>I do treat them as individuals. Are you really gonna deny that most girls aren’t big fans of anime, video games, and tabletop gaming? Especially compared to guys?</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>I’m a woman and a huge fan of tabletop gaming as are almost all of my female friends, I have a girls only group that plays weekly during non pandemic times. One of my best girl friends loves video games and regularly kicks her husbands ass at whatever they’re latest purchase is. I personally know very few anime fans at all. Sure some interests are more common with men but there are still lots of women that tend to enjoy them.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

And I\\'ve been seeing recent controversy about this topic. \\n\\nLook, no denying that kink plays a big role in the creation of pride. It is a part of embracing sexuality and shouldn\\'t be excluded from the community. \\n\\nHowever, it should not be at public pride parades. Pride should be for everyone of all ages. Many people say \"stop catering to the straight capitalized ideal of what pride should be\" and \"pride isn\\'t a party, it\\'s a protest don\\'t police us\" and \"children should go to disney if they want family friendly\" This has nothing to do with straight rainbow capitalism. I figured out I was LGBT at age 11 and trust me if I saw a kink act in public I would be kind of disgusted. I\\'m still a minor now, and I\\'d be less disgusted but still. I know people say that it\\'s up to you to bring your children to pride, but by making all pride events \"wear whatever you want even if it\\'s nothing\" we are also kinda excluding minors from it. It\\'s also non consensual to anyone who is exposed to such acts, because nobody wants to go to pride to see naked people right? The \"think of the children\" phrase holds true here. Young children and teens embracing their sexuality shouldn\\'t be forced to see adult acts against their will. \\n\\nAgain, no denying the role kink plays in the community, but it should be kept at 18+ events. There should definitely be a separate pride for people who just want to do leather and other kinks. That way, you can do whatever you want in a safe space where you know you won\\'t offend others, and because people consented to come to an 18+ event, it\\'s all good. \\n\\nThat\\'s just my personal opinion on it, but it seems to be the minority. I\\'d like to see how you guys think about this.\\n\\nEdit: it appears after reading and responding to several comments, I don\\'t really have a problem with kink, but more with public indecency. I don\\'t care if you wear a collar or leather pants. But I\\'d rather not see things that could get you arrested or questioned for doing in public.</original_post>\\n\\n<comment idx=1>Can you be more specific about where you want to draw the line? \"Kink\" and even \"BDSM\" are pretty broad terms. I can certainly imagine demonstrations that would cross the line, but is say someone merely wearing a leather collar at pride inappropriate to you?</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>If what you’re wearing would get you arrested or at least questioned if you weren’t at a pride parade... that’s probably a good start for a line.\\n\\nIf I wasn’t at pride and walked around in public with only some leather bondage straps, i’d most certainly have some questions asked about public indecency.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>Basically what you said. I don\\'t care if you wear a collar or if you\\'re a dude who\\'s topless and wearing a leather vest. But if it\\'s generally considered indecent in public, yeah</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>It sounds like you don\\'t actually have a problem with \"kink,\" just explicit nudity...</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>I suppose so, though many kink acts do revolve around nudity or minimal clothing to an extent</comment>\\n'}],\n",

              "     'content': '<original_post>First off, let me clarify, I am not defending the actions of Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. I believe that he did use excessive force and the shooting should be thoroughly investigated. This CMV post is not to debate over whether or not Officer Wilson needs to be tried or whether the Ferguson Police is an example of police militarisation in the US. This post is solely to look at the decision to release the CCTV footage of Michael Brown robbing a convenience store.\\n\\nNow that that\\'s out of the way, I don\\'t really understand why everyone was so angry at the release of the CCTV footage showing what appears to be Michael Brown robbing a convenience store. I see in multiple news sources where people have stated that the footage \"\\'appeared to cast aspersions\\' on the dead man\" or is a form of character assassination.* \\n\\n*http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-28827304\\n\\nFinding out that the shooting victim had just returned from robbing a store is critical information, because it provides context for the fact that a police officer confronted him (over something minor and unrelated like obstructing the street) and a violent altercation took place soon after. I see family members and other people saying that he wasn\\'t \"perfect,\" but it seems to me that they\\'re dismissing the fact that he had just committed a crime.* The police officer may not have known of Michael Brown\\'s actions, but it makes sense that Michael Brown would be more on-edge, scared, and impulsive after committing a crime and encountering a police officer so soon after. Thus, this footage provides a critical perspective into Michael Brown\\'s state of mind and his subsequent mannerisms/behavior might have alerted Officer Wilson and escalated the encounter.\\n\\n*http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-fergsuon-shooting-police-name-20140815-story.html#page=1\\n\\nMy view is that the CCTV footage was essential information that needed to be provided to the public. While it may have been misconstrued as character assassination, the footage is an invaluable part of the story that helps explain the context and actions of both Officer Wilson and Michael Brown. \\n\\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for your comments! I really appreciate it. My view hasn\\'t really changed and while I still believe the footage to be relevant and needed to be shown to the public, the institution releasing the footage should have been more removed from the situation i.e. not FPD, but the FBI/DoJ/even the Prosecutor\\'s Office. Additionally, the footage should have been released alongside other information which was excluded, providing a lop-sided view of the situation which served to inflame tensions rather than using information to allay them.\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for the gold, stranger!\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

To see why people are so upset, you have to look at the timing of the release and you have to look at what they\\'re still not doing. \\n\\nThe community has a right to see the police report on the shooting, the autopsy report, and to know the shooter\\'s record.   Instead, after all this time, the police have still released none of this information.  \\n\\nWhat _DID_ they find time to release?   The one video that makes the victim look bad.   \\n\\nIf the police were releasing all the relevant information, people wouldn\\'t be upset.  Instead, they are holding back all information except the information that protects the shooter.   This destroys any illusions that the local police are working for the victim.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>I don\\'t think they can release all the information they have while an investigation is underway. Granted I\\'m no lawyer or investigator, but I feel that doing so could prove to damage the information or interrupt the investigation somehow. If I\\'m not mistaken, it\\'s common practice to not release all the information immediately, only after the investigation is complete.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>Right, they can\\'t release all the information, but by releasing *any* information, they are prejudicing the jury pool.\\n\\nThere *is* a time for all this sort of thing to come out, and that time is *during a trial.*  The fact that they are releasing information that looks bad for the victim and *not* releasing any information that makes them look bad.  That, itself, looks bad.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>There are no FOIA exceptions for not releasing reports about prior bad acts so long as they are not active reports.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>Wait... is this a prior bad act, in which case it\\'s unrestricted and should not be released because it is of purely prejudicial nature, or is it related to the case, in which case such rules would apply?</comment>\\n'}],\n",

The \"Jante Law\" culture, which is a variant of the \"Tall Poppy Syndrome\", where excellence is actively discouraged.\\n\\n2. The sometimes excessive xenophobia, indicating that the model largely works because of a high level of trust between citizens, and between citizens and the state. The introduction of foreign elements, where trust isn\\'t an integral part of the culture, could theoretically sabotage the efficacy of the model.\\n\\n3. The \"Low Expectations\" critique — maybe we\\'re so damn happy because we don\\'t expect much of life, and therefore real outcomes tend to match or exceed our expectations. Maybe our culture would create \"happiness\" under different circumstances as well, indicating that the model itself isn\\'t what\\'s creating these statistics, but rather some other factor, like culture or even genetics (as suggested by some admittedly fringe theories).\\n\\n4. The wealth of Scandinavian countries is also the result of the same mechanisms that have created wealth in the rest of Europe, including most prominently exploitative colonialism. While Scandinavian countries were only minor colonial powers (most notably Denmark), they all benefited massively from trade with stronger colonial powers, like The Netherlands, United Kingdom, France, and to an extent Germany. The Nordic Model may have served to develop and distribute this wealth in a desirably way, but hasn\\'t necessarily created the wealth in the first place.\\n\\nI don\\'t particularly agree with all these criticisms, but they\\'re worth considering.\\n\\nOne relevant question, though: Do you think the Nordic Model is *the best possible system* or just *the best we have at the moment*? I think any Swede, Dane and Norwegian would say that they can point to flaws in our individual systems. Someone is always going to be at least a little bit dissatisfied, but allowing yourself to think that \"this is the best we can do\" is harmful, because our societies *do* have real problems as well, even if they\\'re slightly smaller problems than some other nations face.\\n\\nOne specific problem that I\\'m familiar with, because I\\'m Danish, is the fact that Danish societal coherence is largely based on *ethnic* and *cultural* homogeneity. This means that even if Denmark is doing great in the globalised economy, it is facing a massive *cultural* struggle, because there is no concept of Danish national identity that doesn\\'t prescribe a very specific ethnic and cultural background. In a globalised world of many ethnicities, this becomes a real problem that manifests itself both in very high levels of xenophobia, but also in perpetual cultural insecurity, which makes it difficult to interact with people from other backgrounds. This is how the idiom of the \"duck pond\" (*andedam*) in Danish has emerged, as a metaphor not just for the country itself but for the slightly self-obsessed and self-important mentality of the Danes.\\n\\nCompare this with American national identity, which is to a large degree grounded in the Constitution of the United States of America, its rights, freedoms, and institutions, rather than any specific ethnicity or culture [although obviously a distinct American culture has emerged over the last century]. This isn\\'t to downplay racial issues in America, but the point is that Danish minority identities aren\\'t even hyphenated. It\\'s \"The Danes\" and \"The Muslims\", not \"The Danish Muslims\".</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>&gt; The \"Jante Law\" culture, which is a variant of the \"Tall Poppy Syndrome\", where excellence is actively discouraged.\\n\\nCan you elaborate on that?  How is excellence discouraged?</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>It\\'s an unconscious (mostly) rule of thumb, shortly stated as \"Don\\'t think you\\'re the best at something, or even that you\\'re better than most at this thing\".</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>so \"be humble\"? i must just not be getting it, because it doesn\\'t sound like a bad thing. certainly not compared to the opposite attitude of people being arrogant despite having no accomplishments whatsoever.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>It\\'s the psyche of contentment. \\n\\nArguably progression is fueled by those who refused to be content.\\n\\nIt appears that the culture in Denmark is one that try\\'s to reinforce the feeling that people should be content. That they need not stray from the norms of society. \\n\\nIn theory if this was applied universally, we would not have much of what we have today, especially in the sciences and in innovation. It was the people who refused to see the world \"as is\" and viewed it as a world that could be changed that created much of what we have now. Religion was the obstruction to those choosing to be different, historically. If you were not inline with the religious majority, you were shunned. Similarly in the Danish society it appears that if you are not inline with the Danish culture you too shall be shunned. \\n\\nIn regards to being humble or being arrogant it\\'s neither. It\\'s more so  adhering to the \"status quo\". Don\\'t think you are better, because we are striving for a homogeneous society of equals. Straying away from the socially approved behavior, will in turn make you against the Danish way of life. \\n\\nThe consequence of this is a society that stunts \"thinking outside of the box\". The \"if it isn\\'t broke don\\'t fix it mentality\" makes people who try to \"fix it\" oppressed by those who do not appreciate them for straying from the cultural norm. \\n\\nAs /u/simonask points out, much of the Danish success was from trade with the colonial powers. As he says \"the Nordic Model may have served to develop and distribute this wealth in a desirably way, but hasn\\'t necessarily created the wealth in the first place.\" The creation of that wealth in a globalized economy is achieved through innovation. One example of this is the progression of alternative energy. If the Oil rich countries continue to rely on the historical cash cow of oil, without exploring new ideas. They will be left behind by those looking for alternatives. Similarly without relying on creation the Danes risk being left behind. \\n\\nTo summarize, restricting people from wanting to be the best, will restrict them from wanting to go against the norm. Without going against the norm there will be no progression, which can cause a negative affect on society.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

What\\'s not to like?  \\n\\nBut all this does not obstruct high profit businesses from investing and all that is asked from businesses is that they treat their employees with respect and pay them enough so they can make a decent living. True, most thrift-based businesses would be discouraged from investing but Imo in the developed country there should be no place for such an exploiting business style.  \\n\\nMy only doubt is whether such a model could adapt to a larger country because in all Nordic cases we deal with low populations, large areas and often, decent levels of natural resources and admittedly this does create conditions for easier administration and sustainable economic growth.  \\n\\nCMV, thanks in advance!\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The \"Jante Law\" culture, which is a variant of the \"Tall Poppy Syndrome\", where excellence is actively discouraged.\\n\\n2. The sometimes excessive xenophobia, indicating that the model largely works because of a high level of trust between citizens, and between citizens and the state. The introduction of foreign elements, where trust isn\\'t an integral part of the culture, could theoretically sabotage the efficacy of the model.\\n\\n3. The \"Low Expectations\" critique — maybe we\\'re so damn happy because we don\\'t expect much of life, and therefore real outcomes tend to match or exceed our expectations. Maybe our culture would create \"happiness\" under different circumstances as well, indicating that the model itself isn\\'t what\\'s creating these statistics, but rather some other factor, like culture or even genetics (as suggested by some admittedly fringe theories).\\n\\n4. The wealth of Scandinavian countries is also the result of the same mechanisms that have created wealth in the rest of Europe, including most prominently exploitative colonialism. While Scandinavian countries were only minor colonial powers (most notably Denmark), they all benefited massively from trade with stronger colonial powers, like The Netherlands, United Kingdom, France, and to an extent Germany. The Nordic Model may have served to develop and distribute this wealth in a desirably way, but hasn\\'t necessarily created the wealth in the first place.\\n\\nI don\\'t particularly agree with all these criticisms, but they\\'re worth considering.\\n\\nOne relevant question, though: Do you think the Nordic Model is *the best possible system* or just *the best we have at the moment*? I think any Swede, Dane and Norwegian would say that they can point to flaws in our individual systems. Someone is always going to be at least a little bit dissatisfied, but allowing yourself to think that \"this is the best we can do\" is harmful, because our societies *do* have real problems as well, even if they\\'re slightly smaller problems than some other nations face.\\n\\nOne specific problem that I\\'m familiar with, because I\\'m Danish, is the fact that Danish societal coherence is largely based on *ethnic* and *cultural* homogeneity. This means that even if Denmark is doing great in the globalised economy, it is facing a massive *cultural* struggle, because there is no concept of Danish national identity that doesn\\'t prescribe a very specific ethnic and cultural background. In a globalised world of many ethnicities, this becomes a real problem that manifests itself both in very high levels of xenophobia, but also in perpetual cultural insecurity, which makes it difficult to interact with people from other backgrounds. This is how the idiom of the \"duck pond\" (*andedam*) in Danish has emerged, as a metaphor not just for the country itself but for the slightly self-obsessed and self-important mentality of the Danes.\\n\\nCompare this with American national identity, which is to a large degree grounded in the Constitution of the United States of America, its rights, freedoms, and institutions, rather than any specific ethnicity or culture [although obviously a distinct American culture has emerged over the last century]. This isn\\'t to downplay racial issues in America, but the point is that Danish minority identities aren\\'t even hyphenated. It\\'s \"The Danes\" and \"The Muslims\", not \"The Danish Muslims\".</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>&gt; The \"Jante Law\" culture, which is a variant of the \"Tall Poppy Syndrome\", where excellence is actively discouraged.\\n\\nCan you elaborate on that?  How is excellence discouraged?</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>It\\'s an unconscious (mostly) rule of thumb, shortly stated as \"Don\\'t think you\\'re the best at something, or even that you\\'re better than most at this thing\".</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>so \"be humble\"? i must just not be getting it, because it doesn\\'t sound like a bad thing. certainly not compared to the opposite attitude of people being arrogant despite having no accomplishments whatsoever.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>It\\'s the psyche of contentment. \\n\\nArguably progression is fueled by those who refused to be content.\\n\\nIt appears that the culture in Denmark is one that try\\'s to reinforce the feeling that people should be content. That they need not stray from the norms of society. \\n\\nIn theory if this was applied universally, we would not have much of what we have today, especially in the sciences and in innovation. It was the people who refused to see the world \"as is\" and viewed it as a world that could be changed that created much of what we have now. Religion was the obstruction to those choosing to be different, historically. If you were not inline with the religious majority, you were shunned. Similarly in the Danish society it appears that if you are not inline with the Danish culture you too shall be shunned. \\n\\nIn regards to being humble or being arrogant it\\'s neither. It\\'s more so  adhering to the \"status quo\". Don\\'t think you are better, because we are striving for a homogeneous society of equals. Straying away from the socially approved behavior, will in turn make you against the Danish way of life. \\n\\nThe consequence of this is a society that stunts \"thinking outside of the box\". The \"if it isn\\'t broke don\\'t fix it mentality\" makes people who try to \"fix it\" oppressed by those who do not appreciate them for straying from the cultural norm. \\n\\nAs /u/simonask points out, much of the Danish success was from trade with the colonial powers. As he says \"the Nordic Model may have served to develop and distribute this wealth in a desirably way, but hasn\\'t necessarily created the wealth in the first place.\" The creation of that wealth in a globalized economy is achieved through innovation. One example of this is the progression of alternative energy. If the Oil rich countries continue to rely on the historical cash cow of oil, without exploring new ideas. They will be left behind by those looking for alternatives. Similarly without relying on creation the Danes risk being left behind. \\n\\nTo summarize, restricting people from wanting to be the best, will restrict them from wanting to go against the norm. Without going against the norm there will be no progression, which can cause a negative affect on society.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

We have no method of coordination and actively discourage it. There is no secret raiding subsection or anything of the sort. The admins can peek in our modmail to verify this. The subreddit is an archive or a memory vault of sorts. That was my intention when I made those buttons above the links. \\n\\nWe are not a top down structure. We don\\'t issue commands or requests. We are all equals. Each individual of the armie comes and goes as he or she pleases. Whether they vote or comment is entirely up to the individual. The content of a post is entirely dictated by the member. I like to believe that we are not an ideologically driven subreddit as we have an extremely diverse set of \\'view points\\' such as feminists, MRAs, liberals, conservatives, Christians, atheists, etc. My point is, everyone in the armie has a slightly different motivation for posting. Everyone is uncoordinated, decentralized and most importantly outside the subreddit.\\n\\nIf the admins were to ban the subreddit right now, the comments would still exist today and the day after and so forth.

But it\\'s not an unsually cruel punishment.\\n\\nWe already have the death sentence, and if not that, then life sentences of solitary confinement, which virtually all experts-- including official statements from the United Nations-- agree is torture.\\n\\nAnd if you\\'re a prisoner today, sometimes you are *already* getting raped. Other times you go \"gay for the stay\".\\n\\nSo don\\'t tell me adding rape as a legal punishment is anything unusually cruel or sinking lower morally.\\n\\nIf anything, this would help guards regulate \"safer\" condom-provided prison rape, like how weed became regulated and safer after it was legalized in Canada.\\n\\nSo it\\'s not much of a negative. But why is it a positive?\\n\\nHere\\'s why: there\\'s a rapidly rising population of involuntary celibates. In the last 10 years alone, the population of these \"incels\" doubled from 12% of the young male population to 24%.\\n\\n[https://ifstudies.org/blog/male-sexlessness-is-rising-but-not-for-the-reasons-incels-claim](https://ifstudies.org/blog/male-sexlessness-is-rising-but-not-for-the-reasons-incels-claim)\\n\\nThis is 45,000 incels ballooning to over 100,000. These incels have been behind an alarming number of mass murder sprees.\\n\\n[https://www.adl.org/blog/online-poll-results-provide-new-insights-into-incel-community](https://www.adl.org/blog/online-poll-results-provide-new-insights-into-incel-community)\\n\\nEvery day incels on the dark web discuss organizing terrorism.\\n\\nThere\\'s no fancy peer-reviewed study on that last bit yet-- but I\\'ve seen this happening with my own eyes by digging around social media years ago.\\n\\nI found massive and highly active online communities who worship Elliot Roger and egg each other on to muster up the courage to flatten people with trucks. Buy automatic weapons and kill.\\n\\nIf the population is given free license on their own time to rape any inmates who have been handed the punishment of rape, this could solve some of the incel problem.\\n\\nIt *may* not help; obviously there\\'s no proof in this area. It would be a moral wild west, but there\\'s no time to wait. Innocent people are being shot to death.\\n\\nIt would be far more immoral to not at least try this preventative measure when there are innocents being murdered.\\n\\nThis availability of prison sex slaves with no bodily rights would also directly compete with street prostitution, lowering the demand for a dangerous and morally questionable industry, at best saving two birds with one nest.\\n\\nAt worst, we realize it\\'s not helping and we revert the program. My view is that there is enough reason to try it.</original_post>\\n\\n<comment idx=1>\\'This might work\\' is not a good reason to legalize rape.\\n\\nRape is bad. It shouldn\\'t happen. We do not want it to happen to anyone. The fact that it does happen to inmates so often is a problem to be solved, not an excuse to make it legal.\\n\\nLike a lot of the cruel and unusual punishments, what happens when an innocent person is wrongly convicted and raped? Do we retroactively decide the person who raped them is now guilty? Do we just apologize and pay for their therapy?\\n\\nAlso, we do not negotiate with terrorists. The response to \\'these people aren\\'t getting sex so they want to shoot people\\' is \\'try to get them to understand they aren\\'t owned sex; failing that, try to get them to stop shooting people\\', not giving them the sex they want. That just encourages people to try and use violence/the threat thereof in order to get the government to cave and give them what they want, because hey, it worked for the incels.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>Like a lot of the cruel and unusual punishments, what happens when an innocent person is wrongly convicted and raped? Do we retroactively decide the person who raped them is now guilty? Do we just apologize and pay for their therapy?\\n\\nInnocent people are wrongfully murdered by the state too. By adding rape as a punishment this might save some of those death row inmates, giving us at least a chance to correct such a mistake.\\n\\nThe person who raped them is not guilty.\\n\\nWe\\'d pay for the therapy similarly to how we pay for wrongful incarceration/execution.\\n\\n&gt;Also, we do not negotiate with terrorists.

Who would start using violence to get what they want and how? It\\'s still illegal so it doesn\\'t benefit them. In fact the person themselves in this scenario might be sentenced to rape if they were a convicted murderer or terrorist.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>And you think therapy will just magically undo the trauma of being repeatedly raped?</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>Nope. But it certainly doesn\\'t magically undo the trauma of being imprisoned or executed either.\\n\\nIf anything, less people in total would have to go through the trauma of being wrongfully convicted if this legal punishment results in less total crime (and thereby the need to look for perpetrators).</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>Jesus Christ… how many people do you think area prison because of incel-related violence?\\n\\nThe death penalty does not deter crime, why are you so sure that this would?\\n\\nYour idea is insanely dystopian.\\n\\nNever mind that you’re just encouraging and enabling incels that violence gets them what they want.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

Ask Me **Anything**.  It\\'s fun and interesting to see them negotiate the comments, with the potential for them to be reading the most bizarre and funny points of view, with strange interactions on lower voted comments as well as random replies to far reaching child-comments.\\n\\nVictoria from Reddit turns the medium into yet another \"send in your questions and we\\'ll pick the best to ask this person who is so much better than you\".  Instead of interacting directly with someone, there\\'s a filter.  A filter who types the same way in every AMA, using *italics* and -laughs- and -umms- which completely takes away from it for me.\\n\\nHere Victoria says that the Woody Harelson AMA would have turned out differently:  https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fgsv2/i_am_victoria_from_reddit_amaa/ck91rpw  Which shows that comments are being filtered.  That is what made AMAs so great, it\\'s a celeb being talked to directly, and this is more often POSITIVE rather than that negative example.\\n\\nIn essence I think Victoria turns it into a basic interview with fan questions that has been done a million times before.  If a brand wants to promote via AMA, jump in and get dirty.   I don\\'t even read AMAs anymore if it\\'s got Victoria doing the typing.\\n\\nIf there\\'s a better way of looking at this , please CMV, I want to enjoy AMAs again without the frustration.\\n\\n-----\\nReason for view change:\\n\\nI still dislike AMAs with Victoria, and am clearly not the only one.  This comes from Victoria creating a difference between the celebs and us average Joes.  Of course this isn\\'t always the case.  As it turns out, Victoria will help anyone that fits in her schedule.  So in reality it is just some AMAs (Ludacris as a recent example) that may turn out far more interesting if they had to navigate the website themselves in exchange for publicity.\\n\\nWith a few people commenting with first hand experience, I\\'ve decided that because the benefits of Victoria are more heavily weighted by the majority, my post title view has been changed.  Even if I\\'m stuck hating the AMAs, Victoria doesn\\'t \"ruin\" them.\\n\\nThanks for all the replies!\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your overlords.

Someone that knows Reddit (Zach Braff, etc) will just do an AMA on their own no sweat, so Victoria is adding value by getting interviews we wouldn\\'t get otherwise.\\n\\nIt\\'s harder for other folks - remember how Stephen Colbert just answered 10 questions from a thread? There was no interactivity at all.\\n\\nIt sounds to me like you like a particular type of AMA so much that you *dislike* any other kind of AMA, and that you want celesbs reading random comments. I think the celebs might disagree with you there - they get plenty of crazy as part of their regular life, and don\\'t owe you anything.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>Celebs who are doing AMAs in order to promote, which is 99% of those going through Victoria, I think they do owe the askers and readers something.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>What exactly do they owe the reader?</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>Engagement with a community platform they\\'re using to advertise on.  I just dislike the way AMAs are used as another stop on the press tour and Victoria makes that even more so the case.\\n\\nIf you want thousands of people on a website not made to be your soapbox to see the link to your new film, give something back.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>They don\\'t owe you anything.  They\\'re letting you ask them any question for free.\\n\\nYou\\'re not entitled to something \"juicy\".  If you don\\'t like an AMA, don\\'t upvote it.  The ones where the celebrity gives more than expected tend to be more highly upvoted.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

You can\\'t say, \"I marched in the civil rights movement,\" because that would make you too comfortable. You can\\'t say, \"I don\\'t see race,\" because you almost certainly do. You can\\'t say, \"it\\'s about class,\" because it\\'s about race.\\n\\nAnd she\\'s got about 25 proscriptions that make it so that any good white person is essentially muzzled.

Because it only sounds like it\\'s blaming every individual white people for some one guy\\'s insanity if you ignore the context and look at it from a defensive perspective.\\n\\nI can\\'t know what\\'s in your head that causes that misreading... but it\\'s entirely unsurprising that it *appears* to some people as \"white fragility\". \\n\\nAnd let\\'s not even get started on the *fact* that this entire incident was due to the massive white fragility inherent in the bogus \"replacement theory\" that caused it.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>I agree \"replacement theory\" is BS and I definitely believe racism is systemic and exists at a personal level throughout society. \\n\\nSo you don\\'t believe that the OP was saying white people should feel guilty for the Buffalo shooter? That was *exactly* how I read it.\\n\\nPosting the whole comment:\\n\\n&gt;“My kids shouldn’t feel guilty for slavery two hundred years ago!”\\n\\n&gt;News flash asshole, they should feel guilty for what happened in the past week.\\n\\nYou mention context but I was specifically concerned with the most salient context. The comment was made in a thread about the Buffalo shooter which had happened in the last week. There are approximately 0 universes where one would interpret \"what happened in the past week\" to be anything other than the shooting referenced in the thread. \\n\\nThen \"you should feel guilty\" referring to \"the kids\" speaks for itself I believe. What does guilt accomplish?\\n\\nI don\\'t think I was deflecting but rather wanting to move towards better solutions to the problem OP was talking about (that we likely agree is a problem).</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>Of course it\\'s about the shooting last week. \\n\\nThat\\'s an *example* of the *bullshit* that is the statement “My kids shouldn’t feel guilty for slavery two hundred years ago!”...\\n\\nWhich is basically: \"Oh noes, what horrors, my kids might have to feel guilty/ashamed about something that happened 200 years ago that they are still benefiting from today, in a political environment where racist bullshit conspiracy theories are threatening democracy itself by stirring up racism... whatever will I do?\"\\n\\nAs for \"what good does guilt/shame do\"... Guilt and shame motivate *change*. They motivate not just *rejection* of the bullshit the alt-right is spouting today, but active opposition. They motivate not being a fucking *bystander* while the country descends into racist fascism. \\n\\nBecause this is a situation where literally if you aren\\'t with us, you\\'re against us. \\n\\nBasically: the first comment is basically *parroting* Great Replacement Conspiracy Theory bullshit, and that person\\'s kids should be ashamed of their *parent* for saying it, and not let it stand.\\n\\nThose kids are in *especial* need to not become radicalized, not just generalized \"be a decent human being\" levels. \\n\\nThey\\'re guilty in the sense that they aren\\'t calling out the bullshit, most likely.\\n\\nSo, ok, perhaps \"guilty\" was a bit intellectually lazy and it should have been \"ashamed of their parent\", but it\\'s the word the asshole being responded to used, and punchy political statements don\\'t descend into caviling about the narrow semantic difference between guilt and shame.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>It\\'s interesting you say that guilt and shame motivate change. For some people I believe that is the case. \\n\\nIn my experience it\\'s exactly the opposite. When I feel guilty or shameful about something I do my best to ignore whatever that thing was.

Floor is backwards in this post</original_post>\\n\\n<comment idx=1>For this to make sense you have to have an overinflated idea of the role sex plays in \"life\", the thing you think men have agency in.  I\\'d suggest your argument is ultimately circular in that you see sexual option as a sign of agency.\\n\\nI think maintaining relationships is the very height of social and emotional skill. It\\'s not hard to get laid, but it sure is hard for people to be successful in relationships.  For every man who can\\'t get laid, there are 10 who fail at intimate relationships.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>Do you consider maintaining relationships to be more complex and require a greater range of skills than entering them? Including things like self control, and learning new skills?\\n\\nThose are the kinds of things I associate with agency which are unrelated to sexual options. Someone with high agency can both be flexible in their behaviour in response to new conditions but also able to maintain a high degree of consistency and order to their behaviour.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>That\\'s where i think you\\'re defining agency as \"can get laid\", not as \"capacity to live the good life\".  It\\'s vastly more important to be able to maintain great relationships - social, intimate, family,etc. - than it is to be able to enter into relationships - social, intimate - easily.  It\\'s _harder_.  Further, lacking the capacity to be sexually promiscuous doesn\\'t somehow increase your likelihood of being great at intimate relationship.  \\n\\nI would grant you that _sexual options_ can be a source of confidence and confidence can feed all sorts of agency, but that\\'s not the same as \"sexual promiscuity\".  Options - or at least the belief in them - is almost the very definition of agency.  While I\\'d say there are lots and lots of types of options that increase angency in life and many of them lead to sexual options - career, sport, music, art, cooking and so on - that you\\'ve got things pretty inverted here!</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>So do you think that? Do you consider maintaining relationships to have a higher degree of cumulative complexity than say managing to just maintain a status fitness etc to have frequent causal encounters? Do you consider the nature of the difficulty curve to be different?</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>I consider them to be independent skills - not comparable really, so..yes, different.  One can\\'t say if being a soccer player takes more skill than being a tennis player.  The sources of agency are myriad, you\\'re hyperfocusing on one of them or even using one of them to define what \"agency\" is.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

              "     'content': '<original_post>I believe sugar should be regulated.   \\n1) First off, Sugar *is* a drug. [It is addictive, it has withdrawal symptoms if you do not consume any over-time and has negative effects on one\\'s health; diabetes, obesity and dental issues being just a few of the issues.](http://authoritynutrition.com/10-disturbing-reasons-why-sugar-is-bad/); even [sugar-free drinks are of dubious effects on health, with acesulfame k, aspartame, sucralose and other artificial sweeteners being proved to be of dubious effects on health, unhealthy in larger quantities and possibly affect cancer/diabetes rate.](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-drinks/artificial-sweeteners/). Saying that the amount of sugar in products is one of the main reasons behind western world\\'s obesity is not unreasonable, especially as the [amount of sugar increased over the years in daily products, shifting a typical man\\'s diet severely](http://authoritynutrition.com/11-graphs-that-show-what-is-wrong-with-modern-diet/).  \\n2) Sugar is in all daily products, [the sugar industry lobby is strong](http://www.psmag.com/politics-and-law/the-not-so-sweet-side-to-the-sugar-industry). You cannot rely on the market to create a worthy competitor to sugar(unless [L-Sugar](https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-L-sugar-left-handed-sugar) becomes a thing one day) precisely because sugar is so addictive which make people buy more of the said sugary products. In worst case scenario, the only real competitors would attempt to make their products equally addictive, which is not a good thing for any consumer involved.  \\n3) You cannot trust people, especially children to make educated decisions on drugs they\\'re addicted to. Especially now, as sugar penetrated the market to the very point adults and children both are addicted to sugar, you cannot trust addicted parents to take care of sugar-free diets for their children; nor can you control children with pocket money in school shops or cafeterias. This is precisely why the move should come from above; if you\\'d, for instance, try to make an alcoholic a non-alcoholic the first thing you\\'d do is move away the alcohol from him, not just try to convince him it\\'s unhealthy while he\\'s surrounded by alcohol in every kitchen shelf.  \\n4) Naturally, sugar regulation would likely have dire short-term effects, especially on the economy, but in the long-term it would help the society, serve to deal with obesity, dental issues, diabetes and more and would as a result yield a healthier, and thus more productive society. It is therefore in the state\\'s interest to intervene on this subject if they care for the long-term economy and society.    \\n5) That said I am uncertain what would be the most optimal way to regulate sugar; removing sugar from schools and banning selling soft drinks to &lt;13 year olds seem a decent move - something alike was introduced in [Russia](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2923705/Children-banned-buying-fizzy-drinks-Coca-Cola-Dr-Pepper-Russia.html). ~~Introducing a sugar tax for sugar products could be another way.~~(Nevermind because this would affect raw sugar, not my intent) The most radical but probably the most effective way would be to regulate amount of sugar per 100 ml/100 g/3.5 oz in all products sold and reduce it to a reasonable level like ~5 g/0.2 oz(5%~) with an exception made for pastries and other wholly-sugary products; something alike was introduced, albeit only for children in [UK](http://www.epha.org/a/2554).  \\n6) *added point to clear confusion* Since sugar is essential to most diets in reasonable amounts, I do not suggest a sugar ban nor a reduction that would affect raw sugar. I merely advocate regulation of added sugar where its presence is not necessary, such as soft drinks and most market foods with added sugar but NOT e.g. pastries and NOT regulate natural sugar products such as fruit/juices. I do NOT wish to regulate carbohydrates, merely added sugars.  \\n7) Assuming drug regulation of alcohol, cigarettes and other drugs both soft and hard is valid for their respective health and societal concerns, sugar is comparably uncontrolled in terms of regulation and therefore deserves more regulatory attention especially considering comparative health and addiction risks.  \\n8) I admit I did not consider basic foods in the equation, I mostly was concerned with added sugars in sugary drinks and foods that do not require it in large amounts, such as cereal, yoghurts etc and not basic foods such as bread.\\n\\nThat said I believe sugar should be regulated.

Controlling sugar contents but still selling fries and breads is disingenuous at best, and an absolute waste of time and resources. Two slices of bread have more total carbohydrates than a Snickers bar. Will you limit bread in addition to sugary snacks? \\n\\nIn summary: Sugar is, in fact, not a drug. Regulating calorie intake in a nation where children are starving is not a wise decision.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>I mentioned in other comments, that I do not mean to target raw sugar or the likes of pastries, but mostly target products with added sugars where their presence is not necessary.  \\nSugars are not created equal; you will not - as far as I\\'m concerned - get addicted to sugar by eating bread(unless it\\'s some very sweet bread I guess) - but you can by eating sugary yoghurts, sugary cereals, sugary drinks etc - Nor can you get addicted to fries(that I know of).   \\nI do not mean to target carbohydrates, merely added sugars and as far as I know that\\'s a big difference.  \\nHealthy alternatives are too few and won\\'t push out into the mainstream solely because they\\'re not addictive.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>[Simply incorrect.](http://www.gnolls.org/905/mechanisms-of-sugar-addiction-or-why-youre-addicted-to-bread/)\\n\\nEating spoonfuls of sugar or eating the grainiest of whole grain breads, you get \"addicted\" just the same. Fruits or candy, just the same. Soda or rice, all the same.\\n\\nEDIT: Meant to post [this](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/76/1/5.full), but my clipboard hates me.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>Hm. Interesting. TIL.  \\nSurely though, there is merit to regulating sugar whenever possible to products that do not require added sugars for their attractiveness. Otherwise you\\'ll be met with a trend where people crave more sugar and products will eventually have more of them and none of the products will need them but will have them just so they\\'re bought more frequently. This worrying trend for societies and their healthcare and this has to stop *at some point*, agreed?   \\nAlso I still do not understand your argument of sugar not being a drug; sure it\\'s omnipresent in foods, but its drug-like effects and the need to stop the trend of ever more sugary products trend should be dealt with eventually.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>I disagree still. I don\\'t believe it\\'s my government\\'s responsibility to govern my diet. They\\'ve made great strides in giving me the information needed to make the best decisions about my diet, and for that I am grateful. Education is always more valuable than regulation, in my opinion. I feel it\\'s wrong to penalize the majority for the actions of the minority, and that\\'s exactly what would happen. \\n\\n&gt; Also I still do not understand your argument of sugar not being a drug; sure it\\'s omnipresent in foods, but its drug-like effects and the need to stop the trend of ever more sugary products trend should be dealt with eventually. \\n\\nSugar is not \"in\" food, it *is* food. Sugar, in it\\'s purest form, is the main energy source of your body. It\\'s \"drug-like\" effects include living. Since sugar is a food, it\\'s immediately not a drug based simply on the definition of the word. Having side effects doesn\\'t make something a drug, side effects are a symptom of your body being one giant runaway chemical reaction constantly teetering outside of equilibrium. It\\'s side effects are common across many foods with many different chemical makeups. At it\\'s core, you cannot blame sugar alone for anything you have pinned on it. Obesity can be explained by a shift from physical jobs to sedentary ones, longer commutes requiring vehicles instead of walking, more entertainment sources keeping children indoors instead of playing outside, a media culture that portrays parks and sidewalks as the places where murders happen, and so on and so on. Dental issues can be caused by many things, including tobacco, alcohol, acidic foods, generally poor hygiene, and so on and so on. Diabetes is caused either by genetics or obesity, which, again, has a tenuous link at best to sugar. \\n\\nYou\\'re blaming complex issues on one source, when the source isn\\'t even as harmful as you expected in the first place.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

              "     'content': '<original_post>I\\'ve argued about this with a girlfriend a couple times now. I believe that the freedom of privacy is a kind of pillar of American freedom, along with life, expression, etc. If we do not have privacy we have lost among our most basic of rights. Her argument is that it doesn\\'t matter if we\\'ve lost them, because the government (see: any vested interest with control in mind) will just spy in you anyway, even after they\\'ve been caught (see: Snowden) because they can always find ways to do it without people knowing. My rebuttal is that the battle isn\\'t over until you say it\\'s over, quite literally in this case, because their only threat is us, the people who do want a right to privacy.\\n\\nI use the free speech comparison because similar things happen when the rights are infringed upon. If your freedom of speech is taken away, you no longer have the ability to voice opposition. This would result in anybody who is for free speech will be impossible to find. It\\'s somewhat similar to what happens today with social media hugboxes, the opposition gets harder and harder to find, sounds more and more crazy with each day. It\\'s pretty obvious where this leads. I compare this to right to privacy because too much surveillance means somebody is more hesitant to do natural things, like criticize those in power. Especially when your country is like the USA which has a long history with torture, but that\\'s another story. \\n\\nThe point is, I understand that the idea that we have privacy in this age is laughable, but that very idea is exactly why you can\\'t just roll over for it. It\\'s a constant battle that must be fought; it\\'s somewhat unfortunate that it\\'s that way, but always revel in the fact that those rights even exist in your mind because without them, you\\'d have no idea what you\\'re missing out on.\\n\\nFeel free to ignore the rambling and just try to sway me.

              "     'content': '<original_post>I believe sugar should be regulated.   \\n1) First off, Sugar *is* a drug. [It is addictive, it has withdrawal symptoms if you do not consume any over-time and has negative effects on one\\'s health; diabetes, obesity and dental issues being just a few of the issues.](http://authoritynutrition.com/10-disturbing-reasons-why-sugar-is-bad/); even [sugar-free drinks are of dubious effects on health, with acesulfame k, aspartame, sucralose and other artificial sweeteners being proved to be of dubious effects on health, unhealthy in larger quantities and possibly affect cancer/diabetes rate.](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-drinks/artificial-sweeteners/). Saying that the amount of sugar in products is one of the main reasons behind western world\\'s obesity is not unreasonable, especially as the [amount of sugar increased over the years in daily products, shifting a typical man\\'s diet severely](http://authoritynutrition.com/11-graphs-that-show-what-is-wrong-with-modern-diet/).  \\n2) Sugar is in all daily products, [the sugar industry lobby is strong](http://www.psmag.com/politics-and-law/the-not-so-sweet-side-to-the-sugar-industry). You cannot rely on the market to create a worthy competitor to sugar(unless [L-Sugar](https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-L-sugar-left-handed-sugar) becomes a thing one day) precisely because sugar is so addictive which make people buy more of the said sugary products. In worst case scenario, the only real competitors would attempt to make their products equally addictive, which is not a good thing for any consumer involved.  \\n3) You cannot trust people, especially children to make educated decisions on drugs they\\'re addicted to. Especially now, as sugar penetrated the market to the very point adults and children both are addicted to sugar, you cannot trust addicted parents to take care of sugar-free diets for their children; nor can you control children with pocket money in school shops or cafeterias. This is precisely why the move should come from above; if you\\'d, for instance, try to make an alcoholic a non-alcoholic the first thing you\\'d do is move away the alcohol from him, not just try to convince him it\\'s unhealthy while he\\'s surrounded by alcohol in every kitchen shelf.  \\n4) Naturally, sugar regulation would likely have dire short-term effects, especially on the economy, but in the long-term it would help the society, serve to deal with obesity, dental issues, diabetes and more and would as a result yield a healthier, and thus more productive society. It is therefore in the state\\'s interest to intervene on this subject if they care for the long-term economy and society.    \\n5) That said I am uncertain what would be the most optimal way to regulate sugar; removing sugar from schools and banning selling soft drinks to &lt;13 year olds seem a decent move - something alike was introduced in [Russia](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2923705/Children-banned-buying-fizzy-drinks-Coca-Cola-Dr-Pepper-Russia.html). ~~Introducing a sugar tax for sugar products could be another way.~~(Nevermind because this would affect raw sugar, not my intent) The most radical but probably the most effective way would be to regulate amount of sugar per 100 ml/100 g/3.5 oz in all products sold and reduce it to a reasonable level like ~5 g/0.2 oz(5%~) with an exception made for pastries and other wholly-sugary products; something alike was introduced, albeit only for children in [UK](http://www.epha.org/a/2554).  \\n6) *added point to clear confusion* Since sugar is essential to most diets in reasonable amounts, I do not suggest a sugar ban nor a reduction that would affect raw sugar. I merely advocate regulation of added sugar where its presence is not necessary, such as soft drinks and most market foods with added sugar but NOT e.g. pastries and NOT regulate natural sugar products such as fruit/juices. I do NOT wish to regulate carbohydrates, merely added sugars.  \\n7) Assuming drug regulation of alcohol, cigarettes and other drugs both soft and hard is valid for their respective health and societal concerns, sugar is comparably uncontrolled in terms of regulation and therefore deserves more regulatory attention especially considering comparative health and addiction risks.  \\n8) I admit I did not consider basic foods in the equation, I mostly was concerned with added sugars in sugary drinks and foods that do not require it in large amounts, such as cereal, yoghurts etc and not basic foods such as bread.\\n\\nThat said I believe sugar should be regulated.

All food and nutrients are drugs in a sense. All are harmful in excess and sugar is not unique in this respect.\\n\\nSugar does have powerful drug-like effects, and if used responsibly in an appropriate context it has the potential to massively improve health and quality of life.\\n\\nFor example, sugar powerfully reduces stress (by lowering cortisol, and adrenaline levels, and improves energy metabolism by refilling liver glycogen and increasing thyroid hormone production). When taken after intense exercise, it protects against stress related damage to the body and allows muscles to grow and recover at a rate impossible without sugar supplementation.\\n\\nIt\\'s not right for the government to assume that everyone is stupid and irresponsible, and in the process harm the lives of responsible people that benefit from sugar intake.\\n\\nI am an active person- I do powerlifting, competitive sailing, and work long hours on scientific research. I fuel this with a sugar intake proportional to the demands I place on my body that prevents stress and fatigue. If sugar was restricted and regulated so I couldn\\'t obtain it, I wouldn\\'t be able to function as well in life. I have a very nutritious diet of mostly natural foods and use sugar as a supplement- usually adding it to coffee or milk before and after strenuous activity. I have experimented with a lot of other diets such as low carb paleo, and none allow me to perform as well or feel as good as I do with a high sugar intake.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>One argument that was largely uncontested was - considering the addictive values of sugar and other less healthy ingredients in excess, can you trust an addicted person to make a responsible and smart decision? And why?</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>Pure sugar isn\\'t addictive, it\\'s not even very palatable. It\\'s the unnatural flavors in processed food, not the sugar makes it addictive- and those encourage the over-consumption of any nutrients they\\'re coupled with. People get addicted to processed foods that contain no sugar at all- chips, diet sodas, etc. There is a lot of research into the concept of \"food reward\" that describes this phenomena. These foods are engineered for unnaturally high food reward specifically to encourage over-consumption.\\n\\nLike I said, I mostly take sugar mixed into milk or coffee and it tastes good at first but I can\\'t stand too much of it. There are many natural foods with high sugar content (fruit, honey) and they\\'re far from addictive, most people can only enjoy them when truly hungry.\\n\\nHere is an excellent article on food reward, and how neither fat nor sugar are addictive on there own: http://boingboing.net/2012/03/09/seduced-by-food-obesity-and-t.html\\n\\n&gt; First described in 1976 by Anthony Sclafani, the cafeteria diet is basically a rat-sized buffet of human junk food, in addition to regular rat chow (9). The menu for a recent cafeteria diet study included such delectable items as Froot Loops, mini hot dogs, peanut butter cookies, Cheez-its, Cocoa Puffs, nacho cheese Doritos, cake, and BBQ pork rinds (10). These are what\\'s known in the business as ‘palatable’, or pleasurable to the taste. On this regimen, rats ignored their regular chow, ate junk food to excess and gained fat at an extraordinary rate, far outpacing two comparison groups fed high-fat or high-sugar pelleted diets. Yes, human junk food happens to be the most effective way to overwhelm the body fat homeostasis system in rats, and neither fat nor sugar alone is able to fully explain why it’s so fattening. Importantly, over time, rats become highly motivated to obtain this diet—so motivated they’ll voluntarily endure extreme cold temperatures and electric shocks to obtain it, even when regular bland rodent pellets are freely available</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>Could you explain what *exactly* is so addictive about those foods? It feels implied. If not sugar... then what?   \\nWhat makes them have such an unnatural \"food reward\" ?  \\nRegardless of the source of this, my point still stands(and actually might be more valid now) - can you trust an addicted customer to be responsible for his diet and thus shift the market?</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>Of course addicts don\\'t make good choices, but you would need to ban most processed foods to have the benefit you\\'re looking for, and not target sugar specifically.\\n\\nI also do not trust governments to make well informed health policies. Politicians and voting populations don\\'t typically understand biology, or nuanced arguments (sugar is more complex than good or bad but depends on context) and are just as likely to force poor decisions onto people that know better than to help addicts.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

You need to actually read the study before talking about what it does and does not say. Here\\'s what the study says about recruitment: \\n\\n>Female and male youths, ages 14 to 21 years, were recruited from three gay-focused community-based organizations (85%) and two college student organizations (15%) in New York City. Meetings were held with the study investigators to introduce the study and invite the adolescents to participate in a study of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths. In addition, youths were approached individually and invited to participate. These recruitment efforts were conducted by a gender and ethnically diverse study staff who were college educated and trained to follow a common recruitment procedure. Attempts were made to recruit every youth attending the recruitment site. We have estimated that approximately 80% of youths who were invited or attended a meeting participated in the study.\\n\\nIn short, the only criteria was age, meeting in LGBT groups, and willingness to participate, **not** substance use level. \\n\\nIn fact if you actually look at the data tables, they are not a very substance abuse heavy population.\\n\\n> Items use a 5-point response scale from “not at all” (1) to “very often” (5). The mean of the items was computed as an index of substance abuse (α = .78 - .92 across all 3 assessment times for the female youths).\\n\\nConfusingly put since a \"1\" on all symptoms would mean a 0.00 score.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

The problem with modern researchers (and a good number of past ones), is that they refuse to acknowledge, or even undertake, generational work. They want the credit for a discovery and will do whatever it takes to get there.\\n\\nInnovation is not inherently bad, but psychology as a field of study can continue to evolve its understanding without crossing moral or ethical lines. \\n\\nFor example, if we could get around the moral conundrum of \"personhood\" and the ethical complications of cloning, we could make huge advances in medicine in a very short time period. But can we get there without it? Probably.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

              "     'content': '<original_post>Trying to understand the American tendancy to say they are Italian/ Irish/ Scottish, even if they\\'ve never been there. How much of this is culture, how much of this is upholding damaging stereotypes of other nationalities?\\n\\nSo I know this could be a potentially touchy subject for some, but it\\'s a topic that invokes a lot of different emotions from me, so I\\'d like to hear some genuine American opinions on this.\\n\\nAs a Scottish person, when I meet Americans that tell me that they are also Scottish I can sometimes find it a but frustrating. Context is key of course, but I\\'ve had someone tell me that they are Scottish \"too\" because an ancestor way back when came from here to America. Its then often met with the American spouting off dated and offensive stereotypes to show me how Scottish they are. \\n\\nI don\\'t know how many times I\\'ve come across people talking about being from this Clan or the great great great great grandson of a Clan chief. Or people proudly perpetrating redundant perceptions of Scottish people, and feel entitled to do so because they are \"Scottish\". I just don\\'t like it. Clan history is Scotland is one ancient part of it. God there\\'s so much I can say on that but I\\'ll move on.\\n\\nI\\'ve got a few Irish friends and this seems to be an even bigger phenomenon for them. I think with the troubles and Irish suppression there seems to be more \\'cause\\' to get behind, as well as the identity.\\n\\nNow don\\'t get me wrong, I can appreciate that America is a melting pot/ salad bowl culture. Your country isn\\'t as old as mine, infact we have universities that outdate your nation. So I guess in that sense communities can retain identities in different ways. Plus a lot of immigrant communities from the old world have grown round where the ships would dock. People settled together with the people they left with. So purely down to those historical/ geographical facts, I get why there is no \\'one\\' American identity.\\n\\nI know that A LOT of immigrant communities experienced hardship, racism, otherism and were left to live in squalor. These immigrant communities worked hard to build sustainable lives for themselves. Forged careers and businesses that became iconic within America ie Italian food. Irish pubs etc.\\n\\nI can totally see the relevance to identifying as Scottish American, Italian American or Irish American. Unique communities, with unique identities that are deserving of their own American label. I guess this would make \\'American\\' an umbrella term? \\n\\nHowever, I genuinely find it problematic when Americans equate their ancestral identity as meaning they are entitled to identifying with the stereotypes of the homeland.\\n\\nTo use Scotland as an example. We are a very socialist nation. We have a very complicated national identity within the landscape of the UK. We face serious, and I really do mean serious, issues relating to drug and alcohol abuse. We have contributed to colonialism and we have also been suppressed. What it means to be Scottish changes drastically between the East end of Glasgow and the West End of Edinburgh. I believe my countries issues are often over simplified and over commodified on the international level. I just don\\'t like it when people misinterpret what it means to be Scottish because they are viewing it through the rose tinted glasses of ancestral love.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, I appreciate it when Americans take part in our culture. We love that yous love us. I can\\'t speak for other communities but I know across Europe, its widely accepted that its rude when Americans expect to be accepted as a part of the old countries communities. That we are expected to act excited when yous \"come home\", welcomed \"back\" so it were. It almost comes across entitled, that you assume you know us so well, when what you know has been passed down to you from generations.\\n\\nThis obviously excludes people who are dual nationality. Or are raised in 1st/2nd and in some cases 3rd gen immigrant households.\\n\\nI\\'d also like to note that there IS a distinction between journeying to view the land of your ancestors, and coming to a country and expecting to be viewed as part of that community without little to no assimilation.\\n\\nSo enlighten me, is there more to this I\\'m missing?</original_post>\\n\\n<comment idx=1>I’m an Irish-American dual citizen who lives in New York City, so totally get where you’re coming from. Americans saying I’m Italian” or whatever is super cringe to Europeans. \\n\\n\\nBut I’ll try to explain where Americans are coming from with that. The USA has one of the least coherent national cultures of any country I’ve ever lived or worked in. As an example, here in NYC, nearly half of people speak a language other than English at home, and approx. 25% are not English proficient. New Yorkers speak over 200 languages, according to the dept of city planning. \\n\\nLacking a commmon language and culture, an American saying you’re “Italian”, “Spanish”, “Korean”, etc is shorthand for a shared American subculture - the type of food you ate growing up, the holidays you celebrated, the likely quirks and features of your parents and aunts and uncles. \\n\\nTL;DR Americans mean no offense to Europeans when they call themselves X. They’re searching for shared cultural experience with other Americans. And since America is such a huge country, many people here don’t travel internationally often. And when we do, we often put our foot in our mouths. For example, by learning on the spot that “Italians” from Staten Island have absolutely nothing in common with Italians from Europe.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>Well explained. As you said, I honestly don’t think Americans mean to be offensive by saying what their ancestral heritage is even if they have no direct assimilation. I also understand how it can be irritating to those who are directly from that country/culture. However, I think saying that it is “problematic” is a bit much?</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>Yes, “problematic” is the part of OP’s view that I’m trying to change.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>I think you have changed part of my mind. I think codifing is an informative way to put it. New York is such a classic example for the melting pot apology. \\n\\nI guess \"problematic\" for me comes from when I see people saying they can handle their drink cause their Irish, or they make assumptions about clan culture in Scotland (we\\'ve not had clans in hundreds of years) making my country seem primitive.\\n\\nI think it comes from the imbalance of culture exchange. We know so much about so much different parts of American. Yet yous know so little about my whole continent, never mind my wee country.\\n\\nI think I would be more patient with it, if I felt there was a genuine appreciation of what our culture actually is. And not just whisky, getting drunk, tartan and willy from the simpsons.\\n\\nNot to tar all 300 million odd Americans with the same brush. But just my generalised experience.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>>I think you have changed part of my mind\\n\\nDon\\'t forget to award them a delta!\\n\\n>I guess \"problematic\" for me comes from when I see...\\n\\nHave you considered all the things you *don\\'t* see? All the Irish-Americans who tell people they\\'re Irish-American when asked about their heritage then quietly go about their lives not blaming their poor behavior on insulting stereotypes? This sounds like there may be some confirmation bias at play, as you won\\'t be offended by all the times self-identifying Irish-Americans aren\\'t problematic, because you never see the times they aren\\'t problematic.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

              "     'content': '<original_post>_____\\n\\nDuring a self-defence class I attended, the instructor demonstrated several techniques for women to use when attacked by a rapist. He explained that the positions a male rapist would need to assume to rape a female victim are actually extremely vulnerable from a ground fighting perspective. Correctly applied Brazilian jui-jitsu would use the attacker\\'s weight against him and provide an opportunity for the victim to attack (the eyes, usually) and then escape.\\n\\nI\\'m not a martial arts expert but if this is all true, then girls should be taught to defend themselves from rape and assault, possibly in their early teens. It\\'s not a panacea for sexual violence, I admit, but it will empower women physically and be an effective deterrent.  \\n\\nEdit: Found a Youtube video with the kind of techniques I\\'m talking about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D8r-wH0dkk</original_post>\\n\\n<comment idx=1>This assumes most rapes are stranger rapes, which is not the case. Most rapes occur between parties where there is an established level of intimacy, in a position where the woman or girl is already vulnerable. Attack positions wouldn\\'t help here.\\n\\nAdmittedly, I\\'m making an assumption about the kinds of positions which your instructor was referring to. If you would be able to clarify these then I can give you a stronger counter. But I\\'m assuming that these positions are not things like woman is lying asleep in bed, woman has taken alcohol or other drugs (perhaps without her knowledge) and is compromised because of it. Woman is already in making out position with guy in bed, etc. It also assumes that her attacker doesn\\'t have a weapon, she isn\\'t outnumbered and that she can easily escape from the place she\\'s in, which isn\\'t particularly likely if she\\'s in a private home or hotel room, especially if she is missing some of her clothing or if her children are nearby and she doesn\\'t feel she can leave them.\\n\\nIf my assumption is correct and these positions are more \"how a man would approach raping a perfectly sentient woman from a position that she\\'s not engaging in anything sexual to begin with\" then this kind of self defence is extremely limited in scope, as it ignores the reality of most rape situations. It also doesn\\'t take into account that the natural response to sexual violence (especially when the victim is already in a vulnerable position) is to freeze and/or stop resisting, sometimes mental dissociation also occurs. Similar to the animal instinct to play dead, this is an unconscious instinct which is designed to minimise trauma by allowing the assault to complete with as little risk of extraneous violence as possible. Since men are usually stronger than women, there is a very real danger that a woman responding with violence or self defence will receive stronger violence in return; in most cases this isn\\'t a smart move unless the weaker person is extremely well trained or has the element of surprise.\\n\\nThere is an argument that it\\'s still useful to teach women self-defence techniques against stranger rape because although these comprise a smaller number of rapes, it still helps against that smaller number, which is better than nothing. I disagree with this and think it is more useful to teach both men and women basic self defence to ward off any kind of attacker, because this would be more useful and would also serve to be protective against rape since if a stranger is about to rape you, it\\'s going to be fairly obvious that he wants to do you some violence whether or not his intent to rape is clear. So general self defence would both fulfil the extremely rare stranger rape scenario and also be useful in other situations, meaning it\\'s more useful than only self defence taught with the goal of avoiding stranger rape.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>I think the wording of the post indicates that the hypothetical victims I\\'m referring to would be both conscious and in control of their motor functions. Not drugged or sleeping. \\n\\nIn terms of physical positions, I recall most vividly that of a man on top of a woman facing upwards. I think he had techniques for the others but it was a long time ago (I\\'m hoping someone more knowledgable on the subject chimes in at some point). It doesn\\'t really matter if there\\'s making out happening already, the goal of the defensive measures would be to prevent penetration. \\nSimilarly, whether or not the rapist is a stranger is irrelevant to the victim\\'s lack of consent, and to the methods. The physical mechanics of the crime are the same. The defensive actions would be just as effective with a stranger as with a friend or an acquaintance.\\n\\nThe natural response has its purpose, but it shouldn\\'t be the only response available. The training would provide an alternative, more effective method, than the natural response or even a violent response that lacks training.\\n\\nIt may not always be the smart move to fight back but that\\'s any victim\\'s right, and like I said - and I\\'m not an expert on martial arts - the position a male rapist needs to be in to do the rape, makes him vulnerable to the point that correctly timed action would negate any physical advantage he may have.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>I think your position (if you\\'ll pardon the pun!) is weakened considerably if you can\\'t even remember what these positions are, but okay.\\n\\nThe physical mechanics of stranger rape might be the same as of rape when the attacker is known to the victim but the psychological effects are extremely different, which does matter. It takes an extraordinary amount of training to have something be so natural and automatic that a person could do it under psychological stress, and this isn\\'t appropriate when the physical mechanics of consensual sex are also the same as rape but don\\'t require any self defence.\\n\\n&gt; The natural response has its purpose, but it shouldn\\'t be the only response available.\\n\\nThen you totally misunderstood what I meant. When you\\'re performing an instinctual response, you literally don\\'t have anything else available. Training or not. You\\'d have to be trained to automatically resist all sex, which most women don\\'t want to do.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>They were the most common rape positions, if that helps. There were techniques for being attacked from behind, on the ground, et cetera. Can\\'t see how that weakens my position when my assertion is about the teaching of these techniques, not the efficacy of individual techniques. \\n\\nI\\'ll grant you the fact that psychology is important, which is why it\\'s a big part of self-defence training. And yes, the training must be repeated in order for it to become automatic (they teach that too).\\n\\nInstinctual responses can be overcome - human beings do have that capacity. A person has a much better chance of overcoming or resisting an instinctual response if they\\'ve had training in how to do just that. \\nHuman instincts are not fixed. The basis of your argument seems to be that this type of training wouldn\\'t be effective with your primary reason being: the instinct to not resist is too strong? You\\'ll need to prove it.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>The most common rape positions? I smell bullshit here. I can\\'t imagine that such a thing is recorded. Sounds like somebody\\'s IDEA of common rape positions. Unless you can direct me to a source where actual rape positions are documented, I can\\'t accept that this is a thing. It just seems too implausible.\\n\\nAlso, the efficacy of techniques is central to your argument, too, because if the techniques are ineffective, then it becomes illogical to teach them. If the purpose of teaching something is to make a situation safer, then it should actually make that situation safer. If it doesn\\'t, there is no point.\\n\\nI guess I\\'m not saying that instinct is too strong to ever be overriden. You\\'re correct that it\\'s not. But to develop something which challenges an instinct as strong as a survival instinct, you almost have to make it so strong that it overrides an instinct and becomes instinct-like itself. To compare, this is like military level training, which seems really extreme in itself. Also, how would this be possible, when rape positions are, essentially, sex positions? The only difference between sex and rape is a lack of consent. How do you develop a new instinct for a situation where most of the time that new instinct is not needed? \\n\\nI can only see two possibilities: \\n\\n1. Overgeneralisation. You develop the instinct to violently assault anybody who tries to have sex with you ever. This doesn\\'t seem like a good idea to me since most women like sex and want to have sex which is consensual, not avoid all sex.\\n\\n2. Specialisation. You practice getting into a sexual situation and then introduce an element of fear or psychological trauma, so that the new instinct is associated only with the combination of sex + fear. This seems unhelpful, too, both because it is traumatic in itself, which isn\\'t a great start for something which is supposed to prevent trauma, and it also seems like it would have a pretty high risk of just creating a negative association with sexual situations, which goes back to point #1 - women don\\'t want to be prevented from having sex just because they don\\'t want to get raped.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

While I agree with this argument, I believe that this argument loses all merit when artificial wombs are available. I believe that when artificial wombs are advanced enough to be a viable method of sustaining the fetus, that a pregnant woman should not be able to get an abortion, and must instead get whatever this new procedure. \\n\\n\\nI hold this view because of two main reasons. \\n\\n1. Parental rights equality would be established by forcing both genders to have no right, post conception, to get out of parenthood.\\n2. It would appease people who believe that person hood begins at conception while also appeasing the people who believe that a woman's right to bodily autonomy trump the rights of the unborn fetus.\\n\\nI believe that it is immoral to utilize abortion to get out of parenthood because it causes a parental rights inequality, and I believe this immorality is only tolerated because of the net good done by respecting bodily autonomy. When artificial wombs are viable however, the woman would maintain equivalent bodily autonomy, no longer be able to dictate whether or not someone lives or dies, and would still be on the hook as a parent post conception. \\n\\nEdit 1: To clarify, in this system people would still be able to give their children up for adoption and/or have child support payments from an unwilling parent (And in saying that I found a third reason I enjoy this proposal.

I still believe that abortion should be outlawed and replaced with moving the fetus to the artificial womb, but that we need to wait until artificial wombs are viable and contraception has reached the point where unintended pregnancies are significantly decreased. \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

              "     'content': '<original_post>This is inspired by a recent Movie Fight debate about what is the best movie trilogy (check it out from YouTube). \\n\\nI\\'d argue, that even though I LOVE Lord of the Rings movies, and have seen them dozens of times, it is not a good movie trilogy. For one simple reason: the movies do not work separately. \\n\\nI think for a movie trilogy to be good or better than most, the parts of the trilogy have to work both individually as single movies and as pieces of a greater whole. \\n\\nLOTR does not work as individual films. None of the themes or storylines are resolved within a single film, with the exception of characters who are both introduced and killed within one film (Boromir, Shelob). \\n\\nLOTR films are individual films only in technical sense: they all have their separate release dates, each one ends with ending credits, etc. But the story contained in these films does not work when viewed as a single piece, because you do not get to see the big picture. LOTR films are really a single film, single story, released in three separate parts. \\n\\nI think for a trilogy to be good, or great, any single movie in it has to work without any companion pieces. Sequels should not be requirements. Story cannot be truly great if it does not end. Imagine if Fellowship of the Ring was a box-office bomb, and the two others films were never released. Who would call Fellowship a self-contained, resolved film? It would still be a good film, just without resolution. Audiences would think, what then, only to be answered, nothing. A good story does not ask questions it does not try to answer. \\n\\nThen look at Godfather. If Godfather Part 2 was never released, Godfather 1 would still work perfectly on its own. Part 2 enchances the first one, and vice versa, but neither requires the other.  And no one needs the third one. \\n\\nLord of the Rings films are great. But in reality they are a trilogy only in technical terms, as the story within is one single story, not three complementing ones. If you only watch one of the films, but not the others, story is flawed and incomplete. If you watch the films out of chronological order, nothing makes sense. All the plot threads and all the character archs in the trilogy take multiple films to reach their conclusions, with the aforementioned exception of characters who are introduced and killed within a single movie. \\n\\nAn exceptional trilogy of films should work both individually, where you only see one of them (not necessarily even the first one), and still feel like you got everything you needed and wanted, and as parts of a bigger whole. Lord of the Rings films do not work without the other parts of the trilogy. Without them, story is incomplete, unresolved, and the character archs unfinished. \\n\\nCMV. \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

I\\'m not sure why the structure of a trilogy means it is good or bad necessarily.\\n\\nThere are a lot of ways to tell a story, and LOTR is more like an epic than it is a movie. The books themselves are actually broken up into six parts, and it tells the story of Frodo and the Ring in more of an episodic sort of way. It\\'s about the whole journey.\\n\\nIf you enjoy the thing as a whole, then I think it\\'s fair to say its a good trilogy. Do you think the only good television shows are ones where each episode works on its own? Trilogies are a whole, to be judged as a whole. We already have a name for individual works that we judge them by - movies.\\n\\nCan you provide more examples of good trilogies?</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>&gt;I think this is more of a conversation concerning structure, rather than quality. \\n\\nYes, it is indeed a question of structure, because movies themselves are good, and whether the structure matches the story. Because as a story, it is one story, not three separate, complemeting stories. \\n\\n&gt;Do you think the only good television shows are ones where each episode works on its own?\\n\\nNot at all. The story structure is inherently different in those two mediums. But any good trilogy, whether movie or album, has to work in both the state it was released in (separately) and in retrospect (all together). \\n\\n&gt;Trilogies are a whole, to be judged as a whole. \\n\\nAnd separately. If it\\'s only one whole thing, then it\\'s also only one story, and may only be consider a trilogy due to technical or promotional structure choices. I think there is a difference between a story released in three parts, and a story in trilogy format. Trilogy has both sides, and when we evaluate any trilogy we evaluate both the big picture and all the individual films. \\n\\nLet\\'s say we have a three-course meal. By its definition, this meal consists of three parts, and when we evaluate the meal, we evaluate the three parts it consists of. You cannot evaluate the meal without its parts. \\n\\nBut if we get one piece of the meal now, the other one a year from now, and the last one two years from now, and they all need the other two parts work, I cannot say that the meal was good. I can say that individual pieces of the meal were tasty, but because each part of the meal depended so much on the other parts, I cannot say the meal was good. \\n\\n&gt;Can you provide more examples of good trilogies?\\n\\nFrankly, there ain\\'t that many, but for the argument\\'s sake I\\'ll say the Dark Knight trilogy.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>&gt; Yes, it is indeed a question of structure, because movies themselves are good, and whether the structure matches the story. Because as a story, it is one story, not three separate, complemeting stories.\\n\\nI suppose my point here is a resounding, \"so what?\" What does it matter if something you enjoy has one structure over another?\\n\\n&gt; Not at all. The story structure is inherently different in those two mediums. But any good trilogy, whether movie or album, has to work in both the state it was released in (separately) and in retrospect (all together).\\n\\nDo they have to work separately to be good, though?\\n\\n&gt; And separately.

I think there is a difference between a story released in three parts, and a story in trilogy format. Trilogy has both sides, and when we evaluate any trilogy we evaluate both the big picture and all the individual films.\\n\\nA trilogy is just a series of three movies. They might have any number of structures. From very loosely-related like the [Cornetto Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Flavours_Cornetto_trilogy) to very much interlaced like LOTR. I\\'m not seeing why one is inherently better than the other.\\n\\nSometimes a story requires a longer format, even if that story is told through movies.\\n\\n&gt; Let\\'s say we have a three-course meal. By its definition, this meal consists of three parts, and when we evaluate the meal, we evaluate the three parts it consists of. You cannot evaluate the meal without its parts.\\n\\n&gt; But if we get one piece of the meal now, the other one a year from now, and the last one two years from now, and they all need the other two parts work, I cannot say that the meal was good. I can say that individual parts of the meal were tasty, but because each part of the meal depends so much on other parts, I cannot say the meal was good.\\n\\nSee, now you\\'re talking about release dates. Do you think LOTR would have been better if all three movies were released at the same time?\\n\\nI\\'m also not following your analogy. We\\'ll wait for continuing stories, as evidenced both by television and by LOTR. Serialized entertainment has been around forever.\\n\\n&gt; Frankly, there ain\\'t that many, but for arguments sake I\\'ll say Dark Knight trilogy.\\n\\nThere are very few. In fact, *most* trilogies follow a structure closer to LOTR than The Dark Knight or the aforementioned Cornetto trilogy. I would argue that they\\'re exceptions to the typical trilogy structure, rather than the standard by which to judge all other trilogies.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>&gt;I suppose my point here is a resounding, \"so what?\" What does it matter if something you enjoy has one structure over another?\\n\\nWell, that\\'s the point of this CMV. Debate about structure. I think you can answer any CMV with, so what, what does it matter?, but that\\'s not very fruitful approach, is it? \\n\\n&gt;Do they have to work separately to be good, though?\\n\\nFor TV-series to be good? No. But like I said, different mediums, inherently different rules. \\n\\n&gt;A trilogy is just a series of three movies. They might have any number of structures. From very loosely-related like the Cornetto Trilogy to very much interlaced like LOTR. I\\'m not seeing why one is inherently better than the other.\\n\\nI disagree. I don\\'t think Cornetto trilogy is a good trilogy. It\\'s a series of three good films. Watching more than one, or all three, does not give you any additional value or appreciation for the trilogy, except, well I liked the films themselves. From my view, watching all parts of the trilogy gives you more appreciation or understanding of the story, but you can still enjoy each film on its own, as they work on their own. No one knows if you ever get to finish your story. \\n\\n&gt;See, now you\\'re talking about release dates. Do you think LOTR would have been better if all three movies were released at the same time?\\n\\nAs a story, if we would have had one complete story for the get-go, hmmm, from story perspective, it would have made the most sense. Because it is one story. \\n\\nAnother good trilogy (presumedly, haven\\'t seen the third one yet): Planet of the Apes.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>&gt; Well, that\\'s the point of this CMV. Debate about structure. I think you can answer any CMV with, so what, what does it matter?, but that\\'s not very fruitful approach, is it?\\n\\nIt\\'s a question. I\\'d like to know why you think the structure is wrong for trilogies.\\n\\n&gt; For TV-series to be good? No. But like I said, different mediums, inherently different rules.\\n\\nA movie trilogy has but one rule: be three movies.\\n\\n&gt; I disagree. I don\\'t think Cornetto trilogy is a good trilogy. It\\'s a series of three good films. Watching more than one, or all three, does not give you any additional value or appreciation for the trilogy, except, well I liked the films themselves. From my view, watching all parts of the trilogy gives you more appreciation or understanding of the story, but you can still enjoy each film on its own, as they work on their own. No one knows if you ever get to finish your story.\\n\\nLet me put it another way. What is bad about this type of structure of the LOTR structure? Why does a trilogy have to perfectly balance both its long arc and its three shorter arcs to be considered good? Why can\\'t we consider trilogies that have different structures to also be good?\\n\\n&gt; As a story, if we would have had one complete story for the get-go, hmmm, from story perspective, it would have made the most sense. Because it is one story.\\n\\nSo right now you do have access to all three at once. Why do the release dates matter?\\n\\nThe books were released slowly in six parts.\\n\\nThe crux of my argument is that using the movie trilogy structure of three movies to tell a long story is perfectly acceptable. It\\'s a medium that even allows for long-form story telling. They\\'re three movies that total out to about 12 hours worth of content (extended cuts). 12 hours of good and compelling content. I see no reason to consider it a \"bad trilogy\" based on arbitrary metrics like structure.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

Ever since the beginning of his campaign, my parents had been constantly talking about how Trump was so stupid that there would be absolutely no chance that he would win the election based on how people really do think, and based on that, I made a vow to myself that I would lose faith in humanity if he won. I did. I now believe that humanity needs and deserves to go extinct because of this.\\n\\nBut that\\'s not the only reason why I believe we all need and deserve to go extinct. The other reason is the inevitable box office success of The Emoji Movie. Ever since its ANNOUNCEMENT, I thought that it was the worst idea in the history of movies and even the greatest amount of care put into it would still make me never want to watch it. Well, obviously the movie did not have any effort at all, and nearly nobody liked it. I was really very happy about that. But the thing that made me double down on my belief of humanity\\'s extinction being deserved was the fact that it will become a box office hit!\\n\\nI can\\'t think of any other examples I have gone through right now, but I hope you get what I\\'m saying! I actually don\\'t care if the World War I Christmas Truce makes someone else restore faith in humanity, or any of the other \"being kind to your enemies\" scenarios in big-name wars did the same, or anything else that would restore faith in humanity. The fact still remains...\\n\\nHow could humanity be so goddamn STUPID!!! First, the election of a bully, troll, and CRIMINAL as President of the United States, and now the inevitable box office success of the worst idea in the history of movies, which will result in other equally bad ideas like \"Damn Daniel: The Movie\"!\\n\\nAs a result, we DESPERATELY need to go extinct!

Apperant corruption on various sides does not help. \\nRegarding political issues, be it immigration policies, taxes or care, I have allways found that the answer is not found by leaning extremely to either right or left and yelling at everyone on the other side. I think 'us vs them' thinking is one of the greatest challenges humans are facing, but I used to believe we can get past it by allowing both sides voices because most humans do what they think is right for the people around them. I still believe the last bit, but I have lost hope that people are able to have a civiliced discussion. I have seen attempts at peaceful mediating responded to with hateful negativity. I am no longer concinced enough people are willing to see other's perspectives and come to a shared conclusion or worldview.\\n\\nTo be clear: I am not looking to discuss the aforementioned discussions.

Four political parties with very, very different views about refugees, the environment, assisted suicide, immigration, Dutch culture, etcetera, etcetera. Yet they talk with each other and come up with an agreement about what should happen in the next four years.\\n\\nOn a local level there are even more impressive examples. In Rotterdam there is a coalition between the liberal D66, the christian CDA and the populist Leefbaar Rotterdam. In Amsterdam there is a coalition between the socialist SP, the conservative VVD and the liberal D66. These are political parties with vastly different views on the world and yet they are able to get together, talk peacefully and even come up with policy. In fact I would say both cities are being led exceptionally well.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>I admit to now knowing a lot about the local politics, but what I have heard (undoubtedly biased) did not make optimistic. That said, it's not usually because of hate, more due to the attitude of certain political figures. But the voting period was also very negative to me.\\n\\nEDIT: You did provide an example of different people coming together in the government; ∆.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>What have you heard and why did it not make you optimistic?\\n\\nIn my opinion the main problem with the political climate right now is that when people perceive a certain amount of anonymity (online or in a big group), they stop seeing the people they disagree with as humans. But it is in no way hopeless. Once you remove that anonymity, once you put two people in a room that disagree with each other and just let them talk (**without** an audience that backs them up), you'll see that people will get along just fine. You can get socialists and conservatives to work together (Amsterdam). You can get populists and liberals to work together (Rotterdam). I always consider [Daryl Davis](http://www.npr.org/2017/08/20/544861933/how-one-man-convinced-200-ku-klux-klan-members-to-give-up-their-robes) to be very inspirational. He showed that a black man can befriend members from the Ku Klux Klan, and convince them to change their minds.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>During the most recent elections, I was genuinely afraid of the PVV. Not that they would destroy the country if they won, but what it would mean if many people voted for it, and also that some people vote VVD just to outpace the PVV. \\n\\nMore recently, on this week's zondag met lubach (admittedly not a very objective news source, or a news source at all), there was a topic on dividentenbelasting, suddenly being lifted, which had to do with shell's interest, so there was lobbying. These are things that make me feel like there will always be a fundamental gap between citizens and their representatives. Admittedly, that's not really what my OP was about.\\n\\nTo be clear- I usually wouldn't cite ZML as a source, you've just put me on the spot to name an example and I suppose it's difficult to name a specific one.\\n\\nEDIT: Actually, I've thought of something else- the way nearly everyone around me (admittedly not a representative sample of the population in terms of education) thinks both Geert Wilders and Donals Trump are utterly ridiculous. This is seen as such fact that it is discussed in lectures on psychology subject in terms of 'what can go wrong' in power dynamics or politics, so to say. Yet, apperantly, this is not really fact because a lot of people voted for these people. So I think it's really dangerous that it is not taken serious at all in this way.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>I am somewhat confused about your answer. Is the problem that you think people with different political views can not sit down together anymore and have a healthy, peaceful conversation? Or is the problem that lobbyists exists? Or is the problem that there are people in this world, and a growing number, that vote for demagogues? Or all of the above?</comment>\\n\"}],\n",

Now, I have no experience of any actual human beings physically hurting me or anything else that would typically make someone lose faith in humanity, but what they did collectively was enough to make ME do so!\\n\\nFirst, and most importantly, the election of Donald Trump. Ever since the beginning of his campaign, my parents had been constantly talking about how Trump was so stupid that there would be absolutely no chance that he would win the election based on how people really do think, and based on that, I made a vow to myself that I would lose faith in humanity if he won. I did. I now believe that humanity needs and deserves to go extinct because of this.\\n\\nBut that\\'s not the only reason why I believe we all need and deserve to go extinct. The other reason is the inevitable box office success of The Emoji Movie. Ever since its ANNOUNCEMENT, I thought that it was the worst idea in the history of movies and even the greatest amount of care put into it would still make me never want to watch it. Well, obviously the movie did not have any effort at all, and nearly nobody liked it. I was really very happy about that. But the thing that made me double down on my belief of humanity\\'s extinction being deserved was the fact that it will become a box office hit!\\n\\nI can\\'t think of any other examples I have gone through right now, but I hope you get what I\\'m saying! I actually don\\'t care if the World War I Christmas Truce makes someone else restore faith in humanity, or any of the other \"being kind to your enemies\" scenarios in big-name wars did the same, or anything else that would restore faith in humanity. The fact still remains...\\n\\nHow could humanity be so goddamn STUPID!!! First, the election of a bully, troll, and CRIMINAL as President of the United States, and now the inevitable box office success of the worst idea in the history of movies, which will result in other equally bad ideas like \"Damn Daniel: The Movie\"!\\n\\nAs a result, we DESPERATELY need to go extinct! We fucking deserve it!</original_post>\\n\\n<comment idx=1>You\\'ve listed  examples that are specifically American. \\n\\nShouldn\\'t your view be that you have no faith in Americans and they all deserve to go extinct?\\n\\nEdit: removed \"to\" between \"listed\" and \"examples\"</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>Well, if that\\'s the case, then I think that America is completely broken and that I should move out and live in another country as soon as possible!</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>As a non-american, America is pretty great :)</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>As an American, Americans hating America is as American as baseball and apple pie.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>That shouldn\\'t make sense to me!

              "     'content': '<original_post>EDIT: I\\'ve changed my view partially because I think BF2\\'s situation is indeed unique, though I think the option of a grind that is comparable to many other games makes it not worthy of outrage.\\n\\nSo the situation is that in EA\\'s new Battlefront game, the internet as a whole is outraged that players must play 40 hours to unlock Darth Vader, or to pay money to unlock that character.\\n\\nI think this outrage is ridiculous, since paying for the ability to play as characters or to have other abilities is standard in other games, and that playing dozens of hours to unlock characters and abilities in other games is also standard, and has been for a long time.\\n\\nExamples of pay-for-character/pay-for-ability games:\\n\\n1. CoD (unlock the level 65 weapon day 1 with pre-order)\\n2. Most MOBA\\'s\\n3. Team Fortress 2 (very comparable loot crate system)\\n4. Age of Empires 2\\n5. Newer fighting games with other characters as DLC\\n\\nExamples of play-for-character/play-for-ability games:\\n\\n1. CoD (you must level up for a wider selection of weapons, perks, killstreaks, etc)\\n2. All MOBA\\'s\\n3. Team Fortress 2\\n4. Super Smash Bros. series\\n5. Older fighting games\\n6. Goldeneye\\n\\nUnlocking characters after long lengths of play has been a part of games since forever. In Super Smash Bros. Melee you\\'d have to complete 1,000 online matches to unlock Mr. Game and Watch (or spend dozens of hours completing difficult challenges). Mortal Kombat\\'s Crypt system also had players playing for dozens of hours to accumulate credits to spend to unlock characters at the Crypt. Age of Empires and MOBA\\'s have some characters/civilizations on free rotation, but you must pay money or grind countless hours in order to unlock characters/civilizations.\\n\\nUnlocking characters or weapons by paying money instead of grinding to get them has been part of games since microtransactions have been a thing. The combination of the two has been a thing for just as long.\\n\\nThe outrage against EA is just part of another gaming echochamber source of outrage against another industry standard being blown out of proportion by an ignorance of looking at how things have been.

There are many things wrong with the the game and it is barely out. The reaction that is formed is a culmination of a lot of things for a game that people have been looking forward to for year. We feel betrayed that EA would try and pull something like this after promising no pay wall this and free this no day one dlc that.\\n\\nFor me and a lot of people it was the final straw.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>&gt; The reason people are outraged is becuse of the use of the flawed loot box system. \\n\\nWhat\\'s flawed about it? It doesn\\'t seem any different than the loot box system in other games.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>Well the loot box system in general is a flawed way to handle unlocks in a game. There has been multiple good examples of systems that don\\'t use loot boxes, which to be honest, is only relevant today because it enacts microtractions.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>Can you explain the difference between the loot box system here and why it differs from things like CS: GO, TF2, etc.?</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>TF2/CS are skins and skins only. What you get from the boxes do not change the dynamics of the game, nor are they required to unlock core aspects of the game. CS has everything unlocked for you from day 1, and you can get every single weapon in TF2 for less then 2.50 from automated trade bots.\\n\\nBF2 forces you to use the loot boxes to unlock parts of the game to increase the power of a class, or unlock an entirely new class.\\n\\nThe boxes in TF2/CS or Dota 2 are very different then they are in BF2.\\n\\nEdit: To add to this, in the OP you said that TF2 has a very comparable model to the current BF2 one, and you could not be more wrong. TF2 is free to play, not a full $60-$80, anyone with steam can boot it at anytime and none of the characters or abilities are locked behind a paywall, they are locked behind skill and game knowledge. Weapons are \"locked\" behind a playtime wall sure just due to how random drops work, but the weapons are so cheap you can literally get all 156 of them for a single trade of less then 2.50 from the multiple trade bots that the community has set up. Yes if you are ignorant you can buy the weapons from the store, but other, much cheaper, options do exist and are advertised on a frequent basis. Saying that BF2 has a comparable system to TF2 could not be further from reality.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

But be real, it ain\\'t healthy</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>&gt;Which is a nice thing to say, but it\\'s very possible that it creates an incentive to remain that way.\\n\\nI don\\'t buy that. Every day people are surrounded by incentives to not be fat. Obesity is considered ugly, it\\'s a trait that is frequently mocked, there are entire industries built around nutrition products and diet pills, the negative health effects are well-known and fat people themselves live with joint pain, fatigue and exhaustion in everday life.\\n\\nA couple friends who say you are beautiful and would say you are beautiful no matter your size, not because of it, is not an incentive to stay the same weight. People stay fat because they have food addictions, lack the energy and confidence to change their habits, don\\'t know how to start losing weight and won\\'t seek the information out, have tried losing weight and given up and/or have a chronic condition that makes it impossible.\\n\\n Of all the incentives to be fat, I don\\'t believe there are social ones. The social stigma far and away outweighs compliments from a select few.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>I\\'ll concede that you are most likely right. Let me ask you then, is there a better way to help people with this issues at an individual level?\\n\\nI say individual because as a society as a much different conversation, one that deals with food deserts, health education and care, urbanism and mental care. All of which are factors that matter but at the individual level aren\\'t full proof</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>&gt;Let me ask you then, is there a better way to help people with this issues at an individual level?\\n\\nMake weight loss a social activity. If you\\'re dieting, invite others to join you. If you\\'re looking for healthy recipes, talk with someone and see if they would would be interested in trading and trying new foods. If you are going to the gym after work, or are involved in a community sports team, invite them to join you. \\n\\nYou can\\'t really force someone into losing weight, they have to be willing to do it. Some people won\\'t ever try and there\\'s nothing you can do about it. Some people do want to lose weight, but need a friendly push to get them over that hill. Shame, in my experience, isn\\'t a great motivator.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

Don’t discriminate them but stop complements over unhealthy habits.</original_post>\\n\\n<comment idx=1>Being fat in and of itself does not shorten your lifespan, a poor diet over time does. You can get fat by eating too much of a healthy diet during a couple years of your life, calories are calories. If you don’t continue to gain weight and your diet doesn’t get worse, then your health isn’t at risk. \\n\\nI recommend looking into the Chinese and Korean food cultures. They don’t have the same stigma around being fat that Americans do, because their diets are in general much healthier and therefore being fat isn’t as much of a health risk. It’s even expected that you’ll gain some weight as you get older.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>Fat equals to chronic inflamation of the body , which is a state where Aterosclerosis and insulin resistance build , which are dead. \\nAlso studies show a direct corelation between the fat% in the body and aging</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>https://www.healthline.com/health-news/is-there-such-a-thing-as-healthy-obesity#6\\n\\nThis is a good resource with multiple perspectives. The basic medical consensus is that obese people in general are at a higher risk for several diseases, but that there are several mitigating factors obese people can incorporate into their lives other than weight loss that will nullify these risks. \\n\\nSo basically, the *trend* of obese people being more unhealthy is true. But this doesn’t have much bearing on the health of any one obese person as an individual, they still need to be evaluated on their own. \\n\\nThe stigma around obesity also leads obese people to prioritize weight loss over other types of healthcare, which isn’t always the best thing for their health. Especially since there are unhealthy ways to lose weight (eating disorders, drug use, excessive cardio, etc.)\\n\\nThis is also beside the point, but if someone wants to be fat, why the hell shouldn’t we let them be fat? Eating a lot of food is fucking awesome. Life is short and it’s one of the few objective pleasures we have. It’s their body and their choice. If we’re not their doctor, I have no idea why we’re making it our business, *especially* since high weight doesn’t *always* mean poor health.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>I understand the first part of the post, and let's say I agree with you in a certain sense.\\nThe second part tho : \\nIf someone wants to do drugs why shouldn't we let them do drugs ? It s a short life and is one of the greatest pleasures one can have. It's their body and their choice.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>Depending on the drug, yes. I see no issue with civilian use of Marijuana or LSD. As for other, more dangerous drugs, I don’t believe there’s a valid equivalence between meth or heroin use and overeating. We *all* overeat occasionally, and (obviously) we all eat. The problem with drugs like meth or heroin is that they literally alter your brain chemistry, making it impossible for you to feel happiness or be sane without the use of that drug. Quitting these drugs cold turkey can kill you. They’re substantially more dangerous than any level of food consumption can be, so I just don’t think the equivalence is valid. If food had the ability to do the same thing, I would be against overeating. \\n\\nI am interested to hear why you agree with my first point, though, as I believe it’s more directly tied to the point OP is making.</comment>\\n\"}],\n",

Because the demographic data of PragerU\\'s viewer base is not public information, this is all I have to go on.)\\n\\nWhen I was younger (~9) I came across a video titled \"[The] War on Boys\". Being a boy myself, I had clicked on the video because of the title and the cartoonish graphics in the thumbnail. Being just over five minutes long, it was perfect for my young, short, attention span.\\n\\nI have since forgotten the content of the video, but because videos from the same channel as the one you\\'re currently watching are more likely to get suggested, I clicked on a few more blue-background cartoons.\\n\\nI remember seeing Ben Shapiro, and through the next 3 years I would think of him as some sort of Genius who was always right, because of his childish argument strategies and constant insulting.\\n\\nI have since disengrained the bullshit that PragerU puts out from my head, but I believe that they were targeting a younger audience with their cartoon drawings, short videos, and simple arguments.</original_post>\\n\\n<comment idx=1>&gt;I believe that they were targeting a younger audience with their cartoon drawings, short videos, and simple arguments.\\n\\nIs it possible they were just targeting a dumb adult audience? This is Prager U we\\'re talking about, their broadest audience is dumb people. And Ben Shapiro is a great example of this, since he\\'s upheld as some kind of prophet by dumb people of all ages, not just children. People have begun to realise he\\'s terrible recently, but for a long time he was viewed as a paragon of right-wing virtue by young and old alike. \\n\\nAnd the trouble with Youtube\\'s decision here is that it\\'s too selective. PragerU is just one element of the global effort to target very young children online. The right wing and left wing both do it in droves, as do groups like the incels. Age-restricting only one channel in this manner (and not even the entire channel, just a tiny portion of their videos) doesn\\'t actually have anything to do with protecting young children from radicalising propaganda when there are the other 900+ videos of Prager U and the countless videos of other propaganda channels to choose from, especially considering that the Youtube algorithm already promotes these channels to anyone, regardless of age, that even accidentally watches something right wing.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>&gt;he was viewed as a paragon of right-wing virtue by young and old alike.\\n\\nI mean, he *is* a paragon if you compare him to other right wing public figures with the same publicity. He might not be the brightest, but in comparison to others.....at least he is not batshit insane.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>I mean he\\'s either batshit insane or he\\'s lying (i suspect the latter) but if a paragon of virtue is someone who doesn\\'t even agree with those virtues and is just using people\\'s dumbness to make money, that\\'s not exactly a great look. If you look at his argumentative technique for example, it\\'s that which a child would employ - which is why people are beginning to realise he sucks. It\\'s going to be interesting to see where he goes from here though, whether he\\'ll double down until he fades into irrelevancy, change his persona to be more mature at the cost of alienating a significant chunk of his audience, or stop lying and switch to selling himself as \"the hyper-conservative who realised he was wrong\".</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>He’s a bit crazy, but he’s the *least* batshit insane by far. That just does about shows how far gone the entire paragon spectrum has already went to.\\n\\nHe still sucks.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>Ben Shapiro is one of most intelligent political commentators on either side of the aisle and mopped the floor with Cenk when they debated.\\n\\nThe fact that you have that much hatred for him tells me you’ve never actually listened to him and are just parroting what far left media outlets say.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

              "     'content': '<original_post>Ok let me first say that, yes, the conditions of chickens in battery cages is horrendous and I try to only by free range of cage free.\\n\\nMoving on, I grew up in a rural area and have seen many chicken houses, dairy farms and cattle ranches. It hurts me to hear people demonize farmer based on information that is clearly biased, extremely exaggerated or down right falsified. \\n\\nAt all these places the animals seem perfectly content. They all had plenty of room to move around, were kept in optimized climate conditions, had unlimited supply of water and food that is formulated to have all the vitamins and minerals they need and they get regular attention from veterinarians who look for any aberration from perfect health. Stress is very bad for the quality of meat produced so farmers/ranchers have a big incentive to keep these animals as happy and comfortable as possible.\\n\\nWith these ideal conditions they have shown to have lower rates of disease, mortality and pathogens that end up in your meat than free range. A lot of that is because they’re not walking around in their own waste. Disease is also more easily transmitted back and forth with outside critters in free range. \\n\\nAntibiotic are a big issue but it\\'s not as straight forward as it\\'s made out to be. The FDA highly regulates the levels that go into animals and animals are regularly tested by vets to make sure they are where they need to be. These animals are not like humans. They can’t tell you they are sick. It may be days before they start showing signs and by then they could have passed it on to the entire flock/herd. It is primarily a preventative measure. Antibiotics used for growth are being phased out. No steroids or hormones are ever given to chickens or pigs. The ones given to cattle have shown not to affect the human physiology or to be in such low levels that it is negligible. (estrogen {ng/500g} in tofu 113,500,000 while in beef 7)\\n\\nLastly, for pigs, gestation cages are for their own good. Like many animals, pigs establish a hierarchical social order when mixed together. When sows are in groups, dominant sows tend to act aggressively and can even harm their own babies. They are only kept in these cages for a fraction of their lives until they can be re-integrated.\\n\\nI realized I made a lot of claims there. I\\'d be happy to provide citations for any of those as requested.</original_post>\\n\\n<comment idx=1>First of all, tofu contains phytoestrogrens, which is chemically similar to estrogen but is not the same thing. [source](http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/eating-soy-increase-estrogen-production-2870.html) They act similar to estrogen but in a weaker form. I\\'m not sure why you brought that up: as a comparison or to state indirectly that even if one is eating tofu instead of meat they are consuming hormones (even though this is false).\\n\\nAs everyone has already brought up, you obviously don\\'t understand what a factory farm is. I suggest educating yourself with a film like Food, Inc. or Earthlings, which you can watch [here](http://earthlings.com). The latter shows just how widespread cruelty to animals is on factory farms and in other situations where animals and humans interact. Most people who are concerned about animals aren\\'t trying to shut down small, family owned farms or demonize these people. They\\'re trying to expose the horrendous, unnecessary treatment of animals in these huge factory farms. \\n\\nThese aren\\'t places that care about anything but making as much money as possible, at the expense of animal life and risking the health and safety of their workers and consumers.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>Far enough. I\\'ll check those out but I am admittedly skeptical since they obviously have an agenda.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>It\\'s good to be skeptical and you should always ask questions and evaluate sources. But I think it\\'s important to examine what motivates others agendas. I personally tend to distrust agendas that are obviously geared toward money, and am more open to trusting agendas that seem to have greater interests at heart such as animal rights or environmental concerns. \\n\\nBut also ask yourself why you hold your beliefs and what YOUR agenda is. There had to have been a reason that you posted this topic on this thread, either to solidify your own opinion or to learn something new. \\n\\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with being biased, because everyone is to a certain degree. But it\\'s important to keep your mind open and learn from others so you can find your truth.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>your sources ITT consist of personal anecdotes and  \"thedairymom.blogspot.com,\" so at this point we could cite PETA and our sources would still be more credible</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>And I said in the post before that I was just doing a google search to continue the conversation and that I did know how valid it was.

              "     'content': '<original_post>Kamala Harris was recently selected as Biden\\'s running mate, and it re-sparked a common misunderstanding of the Constitution. The definition of \"natural born citizen\". Clearly, Kamala Harris is eligible.\\n\\nJohn McCain, however, was not so clearly a \"natural born citizen\" as he had been born in the Panama Canal Zone to two US citizens. It was contentious enough of an issue that the Senate passed a resolution saying he was eligible. Specifically, McCain was born to two US citizens who were overseas at the direct orders of the US govt. If McCain was ineligible then every child born to US servicemembers overseas would be ineligible and most people agreed that this was not the founders intent.\\n\\nHowever, Rafael \"Ted\" Cruz was born to an American and a Cuban while they worked in Canada for a private company. If Ted Cruz is eligible to be a US president, then basically anyone who has a claim to citizenship is eligible, even if they have never lived in the United States.\\n\\n*Example: A young woman is born in China. Her mother is American, her father is Chinese. She lives her entire life in China, but claims dual citizenship for legal purposes. At the age of 42, she decides to move to the United States. She becomes a popular politician and runs for President, only 14 years after being elected to the US House of Representatives.*\\n\\nWould she be eligible? This seems like the exact scenario the founders were trying to prevent. Someone with loyalties to another country taking the reins of power of the USA.If Ted Cruz is eligible, then this woman would be eligible. At that point, why wouldn\\'t we extend the presidency to citizens like Arnold Schwarzenegger?\\n\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-born-citizen\\\\_clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-born-citizen_clause)\\n\\nEdit: adjusted for the residency requirement\\n\\n**For all mentions of the Nationality Act of 1790.**The law, as written in 1790 said the following:\\n\\n* Only free white males could become citizens\\n* Provided, that the right of [citizenship](https://immigrationhistory.org/item/1790-nationality-act/#) shall not descend to persons whose fathers have never been resident in the United States\\n\\nFirst, we obviously don\\'t still have this law on the books. It was fully and totally cancelled and the phrase about \"natural born citizen\" was removed. You can\\'t point to a law that is not currently applicable as your definition. They clearly felt the need to define the term, and they later rescinded that definition\\n\\nFurther, I think you could make a strong argument that it only applied to children of the father with that definition. This fits with what I have read of citizenship laws in Europe, which stated that citizenship status descended from the paternal line. (I know this because it was a big controversy when people started raping slaves, as it would make the children citizens and free. Most countries made a law explicitly exempting this rule in the case of slave-master relationships)\\n\\n**Naturalized vs natural born**\\n\\nThe term naturalized wasn\\'t created until the 1940s, when international travel became much more common. The term presently means \"conferred after birth\", but that term was not used during prior to that period. In fact, \"natural born\" was used in the US and the UK to imply a citizen granted citizenship by their birth in the USA.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;</original_post>\\n\\n<comment idx=1>The process of gaining citizenship is called naturalization. It seems fairly obvious to me that the term natural born citizen is intended to distinguish those who become citizens by birth from those that become citizens via the naturalization process.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>I have a different interpretation</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>The term naturalization is not defined in the constitution. Rather, the authority to define it is an enumerated power of congress (Article 1, section 8, clause 4). So when the constitution was originally ratified, the uniform naturalization rule had not yet been established. If congress had opted to grant citizenship at birth based on the principle of jus sanguinis (right of blood) instead of jus solei (right of soil), then your interpretation would be rather strange.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>and does any applicable law define \"natural born US citizen\"</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>There was the naturalization act of 1790 which, among other things, stated that children born abroad when both parents are U.S. citizens \"shall be considered as natural born citizens,\". That was passed 2 years after the constitution was ratified and many of the framers were congressmen at that time.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

I\\'m wholly indifferent to the Assassin\\'s Creed games, but apparently this game features 4 person local multiplayer and only includes a slate of male characters. As a result of this news, some of my feminist former-friends posted articles to this effect: http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/11/5799386/no-female-characters-in-assassins-creed-unity-too-much-work\\n\\nI\\'m not going to weigh in on the truth of Ubisoft\\'s claims particularly, whether or not their claims were justified, or whether any of the views held by either side is right and just. The general consensus among the feminism crowd seemed to be along the lines that:\\n\\n* 1. There are many sexist stereotypes prevalent in video games, possibly moreso in mainstream titles, and particularly noticed (by the feminists) are those stereotypes concerning women.\\n* 2. There is a large and substantial base of female gamers, many of whom would presumably enjoy games that break stereotypes and employ strong female lead characters\\n* 3. Many popular games today don\\'t necessarily serve female gamers so well\\n\\nI\\'m not going to suggest that feminists shouldn\\'t complain (well, I might a little), but from my vantage point that\\'s pretty much all I see get done.

Barriers to entry have probably never been lower to go develop for almost any platform you like, and indy games that hit it big have the opportunity to hit it REALLY big. You could make the video game equivalent of \"Orange is the New Black\" and have millions of loving, adoring fans who will cheer and talk about how you helped bring women into the video game mainstream.

              "     'content': '<original_post>To start, I am a lesbian. And I\\'ve been seeing recent controversy about this topic. \\n\\nLook, no denying that kink plays a big role in the creation of pride. It is a part of embracing sexuality and shouldn\\'t be excluded from the community. \\n\\nHowever, it should not be at public pride parades. Pride should be for everyone of all ages. Many people say \"stop catering to the straight capitalized ideal of what pride should be\" and \"pride isn\\'t a party, it\\'s a protest don\\'t police us\" and \"children should go to disney if they want family friendly\" This has nothing to do with straight rainbow capitalism. I figured out I was LGBT at age 11 and trust me if I saw a kink act in public I would be kind of disgusted. I\\'m still a minor now, and I\\'d be less disgusted but still. I know people say that it\\'s up to you to bring your children to pride, but by making all pride events \"wear whatever you want even if it\\'s nothing\" we are also kinda excluding minors from it. It\\'s also non consensual to anyone who is exposed to such acts, because nobody wants to go to pride to see naked people right? The \"think of the children\" phrase holds true here. Young children and teens embracing their sexuality shouldn\\'t be forced to see adult acts against their will. \\n\\nAgain, no denying the role kink plays in the community, but it should be kept at 18+ events. There should definitely be a separate pride for people who just want to do leather and other kinks. That way, you can do whatever you want in a safe space where you know you won\\'t offend others, and because people consented to come to an 18+ event, it\\'s all good. \\n\\nThat\\'s just my personal opinion on it, but it seems to be the minority. I\\'d like to see how you guys think about this.\\n\\nEdit: it appears after reading and responding to several comments, I don\\'t really have a problem with kink, but more with public indecency. I don\\'t care if you wear a collar or leather pants. But I\\'d rather not see things that could get you arrested or questioned for doing in public.</original_post>\\n\\n<comment idx=1>Kink has, for so long, been a central part of the gay community. The freedom to have gay sex gave us the freedom to explore how we like having that sex. No one should be fucking in public, but that’s already illegal, and by all means, NOT unique to gays in the slightest. But kink? Walking around in collars and leather and latex and masks? That’s almost an essential part of gay sexuality. As far as being family friendly, Pride events have no business being family friendly, especially after straights spent so long shutting us out of their families.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>&gt;Pride events have no business being family friendly, especially after straights spent so long shutting us out of their families.\\n\\nFor fucks sake, what a remarkable way to make people allies right? What a great way to ensure other people in your group are treated equally, by shutting everyone else out.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>Pride is about celebrating the LGBT community and how far we’ve made it despite our continual oppression. It’s about showing that hey, we’re still here, even after sodomy laws, the “gay plague”, censorship, drugs, bathroom bills, military bans. I don’t give a fuck if allies come to Pride or not. Are we dependent on cishets for our survival? Unfortunately, we probably always will be. Is it my responsibility to make you feel like you should be celebrated for being a decent human being? Absolutely fucking not.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>&gt;despite our continual oppression\\n\\n...\\n\\n&gt;I don’t give a fuck if allies come to Pride or not.\\n\\nYou really don\\'t see how the latter leads to the former? How being exclusionary makes enemies and leads to oppression?\\n\\nEqually that you can\\'t celebrate how far you as a community has come without walking around in public with butt plugs showing?</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>“Walking around in collars and leather and latex and masks?”\\n\\nWhere exactly did I write that I think wearing buttplugs at Pride is ok? Please, show me.\\n\\nAlso, Pride is a celebration for gay people. Not allies. I will not applaud someone for not being a shitty person. Just like we don’t use Black History Month to applaud white folks who aren’t racist.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

              "     'content': '<original_post>First off, let me clarify, I am not defending the actions of Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. I believe that he did use excessive force and the shooting should be thoroughly investigated. This CMV post is not to debate over whether or not Officer Wilson needs to be tried or whether the Ferguson Police is an example of police militarisation in the US. This post is solely to look at the decision to release the CCTV footage of Michael Brown robbing a convenience store.\\n\\nNow that that\\'s out of the way, I don\\'t really understand why everyone was so angry at the release of the CCTV footage showing what appears to be Michael Brown robbing a convenience store. I see in multiple news sources where people have stated that the footage \"\\'appeared to cast aspersions\\' on the dead man\" or is a form of character assassination.* \\n\\n*http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-28827304\\n\\nFinding out that the shooting victim had just returned from robbing a store is critical information, because it provides context for the fact that a police officer confronted him (over something minor and unrelated like obstructing the street) and a violent altercation took place soon after. I see family members and other people saying that he wasn\\'t \"perfect,\" but it seems to me that they\\'re dismissing the fact that he had just committed a crime.* The police officer may not have known of Michael Brown\\'s actions, but it makes sense that Michael Brown would be more on-edge, scared, and impulsive after committing a crime and encountering a police officer so soon after. Thus, this footage provides a critical perspective into Michael Brown\\'s state of mind and his subsequent mannerisms/behavior might have alerted Officer Wilson and escalated the encounter.\\n\\n*http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-fergsuon-shooting-police-name-20140815-story.html#page=1\\n\\nMy view is that the CCTV footage was essential information that needed to be provided to the public. While it may have been misconstrued as character assassination, the footage is an invaluable part of the story that helps explain the context and actions of both Officer Wilson and Michael Brown. \\n\\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for your comments! I really appreciate it. My view hasn\\'t really changed and while I still believe the footage to be relevant and needed to be shown to the public, the institution releasing the footage should have been more removed from the situation i.e. not FPD, but the FBI/DoJ/even the Prosecutor\\'s Office. Additionally, the footage should have been released alongside other information which was excluded, providing a lop-sided view of the situation which served to inflame tensions rather than using information to allay them.\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for the gold, stranger!\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Why do you need to know details of the investigation that isn\\'t finished yet? And this isn\\'t a case of transparency, this is a case of the local police selectively releasing what *they* want you to know, against the advice of their superiors. I can\\'t imagine what purpose releasing this footage serves to the investigation, and could even be destructive by coloring potential witnesses with information they didn\\'t need to know.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>&gt;against the advice of their superiors\\n\\nGiven that the Chief of Police released the information in response to a FOIA request, I want to challenge you to explain:\\n\\nWho exactly is the Chief of Police\\'s superior? and\\nWhy should he not have followed the law and released the request pursuant to a legal FOIA request?</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>\"superiors\" was probably the wrong word. What I was referring to was from http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/us/ferguson-missouri-protests.html?_r=0. \\n\\n&gt; The Justice Department asked the Ferguson Police Department not to release the video because of concerns that “it would roil the community further,” a United States law enforcement official said on Saturday. The Ferguson department released the video on Friday and the Justice official said it “occurred over the objection of federal authorities.” The official said a copy of the video had been in possession of federal investigators, as well, “and there were never any plans by the federal investigators to release that copy.”\\n\\n&gt; The dispute showed further divisions among the authorities in the handling of the case. The surveillance video appeared to show Mr. Brown stealing a box of cigarillos. Shortly after the release of the video, Captain Johnson expressed his displeasure, saying he had not been told that the police planned to release it.\\n\\nSo maybe not \"superiors\" in the sense of their direct boss, but people who I think they should have listened to.\\n\\nI don\\'t know all the specifics of how FOIA requests work, but I\\'m skeptical that they don\\'t have much legal leeway to have handled it better. I\\'m open to learning more though.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>The Missouri version of the Freedom of Information Act is generally referred to as the Sunshine Law. Specifically to these events, the applicable section is 610.100.\\n\\nhttp://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/C600-699/6100000100.HTM\\n\\nSpecifically to your query, \\n\\n&gt;\\'2. Each law enforcement agency of this state, of any county, and of any municipality shall maintain records of all incidents reported to the agency, investigations and arrests made by such law enforcement agency. All incident reports and arrest reports shall be open records. Notwithstanding any other provision of law other than the provisions of subsections 4, 5 and 6 of this section or section 320.083, investigative reports of all law enforcement agencies are closed records until the investigation becomes inactive. If any person is arrested and not charged with an offense against the law within thirty days of the person\\'s arrest, the arrest report shall thereafter be a closed record except that the disposition portion of the record may be accessed and except as provided in section 610.120.\\n\\nSo, the declaration that the investigation was exceptionally cleared due to the suspect\\'s death made the record open.\\n\\nThe result is that if someone files a Sunshine Law request with the Ferguson Police Department for all records relating to Michael Brown, the PD doesn\\'t have a choice as to whether or not they can release it. They are legally obligated, as it is an open record.\\n\\nMoreover, there are teeth to this law.\\n\\nSection 610.115\\n&gt;A person who knowingly violates any provision of section 610.100, 610.105, 610.106, or 610.120 is guilty of a class A misdemeanor.\\n\\nSection 610.100\\n&gt;If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the law enforcement officer or agency has knowingly violated this section, the officer or agency shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount up to one thousand dollars. If the court finds that there is a knowing violation of this section, the court may order payment by such officer or agency of all costs and attorneys\\' fees, as provided by section 610.027. If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the law enforcement officer or agency has purposely violated this section, the officer or agency shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount up to five thousand dollars and the court shall order payment by such officer or agency of all costs and attorney fees, as provided in section 610.027. The court shall determine the amount of the penalty by taking into account the size of the jurisdiction, the seriousness of the offense, and whether the law enforcement officer or agency has violated this section previously.\\n\\nAn FBI agent, DOJ prosecutor, and the President can all get on the phone with me and ask me to break the law, and I\\'m going to tell all three of them to kiss my ass. I\\'m not going to commit a crime, lose my job, and all that because they don\\'t think releasing the records is a good idea.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>Was it a misdemeanor that they released it on Friday instead of Thursday? Would it have been a misdemeanor if they had released it next week or the week after? Do you think they\\'ve been consistently cooperative releasing all aspects of the police report?</comment>\\n'}],\n",

High level of education, highly efficient administration effectively invests into the society, providing multiple incentives and angles of growth.  \\n\\nPeople have trust in their government, in their administration and how their taxes are used. This leads to a high level of security; problems are laid off them and ultimately this leads to a high level of happiness.   \\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report  \\n\\nLow level of income inequality, high GDP and PPP per capita, liberal laws, low crime, low corruption, good healthcare, great education, low pollution. What\\'s not to like?  \\n\\nBut all this does not obstruct high profit businesses from investing and all that is asked from businesses is that they treat their employees with respect and pay them enough so they can make a decent living. True, most thrift-based businesses would be discouraged from investing but Imo in the developed country there should be no place for such an exploiting business style.  \\n\\nMy only doubt is whether such a model could adapt to a larger country because in all Nordic cases we deal with low populations, large areas and often, decent levels of natural resources and admittedly this does create conditions for easier administration and sustainable economic growth.  \\n\\nCMV, thanks in advance!\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Poor people don\\'t qualify. It\\'s much like the pyramid scheme of Social Security in USA - poor young people are forced to pay for the benefits of the old rich.\\n* The reason that it \"works\" (i.e. not everyone leaves or stop working) is mostly cultural - Swedes are raised to have pride in their profession. They would even pay to have a job even if there was less money in it than being on the dole. This is why Swedes that migrated to USA show a similar work ethic and happiness score to those who stayed in Sweden.\\n* The redistribution hasn\\'t removed the class differences - in fact, social mobility is smaller than in countries with lower overall tax like USA. If the Nordic Model didn\\'t remove class differences in Sweden, why would it remove class differences in places like USA?\\n* The tax doesn\\'t go to the intended purposes, but are instead wasted. When my first child was born, we had to call every second hour to see if there was any free rooms in the hospitals. \"Wait, wait\", they kept telling us. The contractions started to get really close, so finally they let us go to the hospital. But the hospital in our city was full, so we had to go to the second closest city. That hospital was *also* full. So my wife did most of the birthing on a sofa in the TV room/rec room.\\n* The reason that there are still some old corporations left in Sweden is that the governments have traditionally pampered to a small number of industrials to keep some sort of economy going here. Basically high taxes for regular people, not so much for the richest. Just look at how they treated the Wallenberg family. This has cemented the old class structures and makes it impossible for new people to rise to the same heights as those families who got rich before the taxes on income were raised considerably. Now they gave Facebook a hundred million kr. It\\'s crony capitalism.\\n\\nI\\'m thinking of moving to Estonia to start a business there. I don\\'t really like the place, but I don\\'t see how I have any opportunity here in Sweden.\\n\\nAlso, take the \"happiness report\" with a grain of salt. The conditions are set up by people who like to describe Scandinavian national democractic socialism as an Utopia, just like you do.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>&gt;The \"safety net\" is mostly given to those who already have money. **Poor people don\\'t qualify.** It\\'s much like the pyramid scheme of Social Security in USA - poor young people are forced to pay for the benefits of the old rich.\\n\\nCould you explain the bolded text? If poor people are not getting redistributed money through the tax system, then this is new news regarding the *Nordic Model*.\\n\\n&gt;The reason that it \"works\" (i.e. not everyone leaves or stop working) is mostly cultural - Swedes are raised to have pride in their profession. They would even pay to have a job even if there was less money in it than being on the dole. This is why Swedes that migrated to USA show a similar work ethic and happiness score to those who stayed in Sweden.\\n\\nI think you are missing the point. Strong work ethic is not absent in the US or other places, it is just hard to sustain in a system that has evolved to make it increasingly difficult for those at the bottom to move up the ladder, so then you get generational poverty and welfare dependency, which works as a positive feedback system leading to an increasingly large divide between classes. Consider the economic advantages in the US from being able to afford to go to an Ivy league university.\\n\\n&gt; The redistribution hasn\\'t removed the class differences - in fact, **social mobility is smaller than in countries with lower overall tax like USA.** If the Nordic Model didn\\'t remove class differences in Sweden, why would it remove class differences in places like USA?\\n\\nCould you provide your sources for this claim? Perhaps you are not familiar with the saying [\"If you want to live the American dream, move to Denmark [or other Scandinavian countries]\".](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/17/want-to-get-ahead-move-to-denmark) Also, class differences are most likely inevitable, however, the source of class distinctions would likely change.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>I thought ivy league colleges covers financial need?</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>There are a lot of bursaries and they take quotas from different social classes etc... so perhaps my point is somewhat lost. My point is, in the US money factors into your education more so than most places on the planet.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>&gt; Take quotas from different social classes\\n\\nDo you have a source for this?</comment>\\n'}],\n",

              "     'content': '<original_post>First off, let me clarify, I am not defending the actions of Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. I believe that he did use excessive force and the shooting should be thoroughly investigated. This CMV post is not to debate over whether or not Officer Wilson needs to be tried or whether the Ferguson Police is an example of police militarisation in the US. This post is solely to look at the decision to release the CCTV footage of Michael Brown robbing a convenience store.\\n\\nNow that that\\'s out of the way, I don\\'t really understand why everyone was so angry at the release of the CCTV footage showing what appears to be Michael Brown robbing a convenience store. I see in multiple news sources where people have stated that the footage \"\\'appeared to cast aspersions\\' on the dead man\" or is a form of character assassination.* \\n\\n*http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-28827304\\n\\nFinding out that the shooting victim had just returned from robbing a store is critical information, because it provides context for the fact that a police officer confronted him (over something minor and unrelated like obstructing the street) and a violent altercation took place soon after. I see family members and other people saying that he wasn\\'t \"perfect,\" but it seems to me that they\\'re dismissing the fact that he had just committed a crime.* The police officer may not have known of Michael Brown\\'s actions, but it makes sense that Michael Brown would be more on-edge, scared, and impulsive after committing a crime and encountering a police officer so soon after. Thus, this footage provides a critical perspective into Michael Brown\\'s state of mind and his subsequent mannerisms/behavior might have alerted Officer Wilson and escalated the encounter.\\n\\n*http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-fergsuon-shooting-police-name-20140815-story.html#page=1\\n\\nMy view is that the CCTV footage was essential information that needed to be provided to the public. While it may have been misconstrued as character assassination, the footage is an invaluable part of the story that helps explain the context and actions of both Officer Wilson and Michael Brown. \\n\\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for your comments! I really appreciate it. My view hasn\\'t really changed and while I still believe the footage to be relevant and needed to be shown to the public, the institution releasing the footage should have been more removed from the situation i.e. not FPD, but the FBI/DoJ/even the Prosecutor\\'s Office. Additionally, the footage should have been released alongside other information which was excluded, providing a lop-sided view of the situation which served to inflame tensions rather than using information to allay them.\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for the gold, stranger!\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Granted, the connection\\'s not as clear as a \"I pulled the fire alarm\" - \"the fire alarm rings\" connection, but surely having just committed a violent robbery influences your state of mind to some degree and those arguing otherwise are not adding anything of value to this discussion.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>Thanks. I couldn\\'t phrase it as succinctly as you did.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>&gt;but surely having just committed a violent robbery influences your state of mind\\n\\nDoes it influence it in such a way that you go from shoving a clerk for cigarettes to jumping through the window of an SUV of a cop and trying to fight him for his gun?\\n\\nI can\\'t wrap my mind around how people think it is more believable that the above happened instead of not. This is also choosing to believe that even after the cop told him he just wanted those two to move out of the street that Brown still chose to be wound up and do the above.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>Is it not possible that Brown had a defensive mindset, after what happened at the convenient store... Thinking that the cop was following up on it? Even though the cop had only asked him to move out of the street, if I had just done what it appeared that he did, I would be nervous if an officer was talking to me. To add more, I would\\'ve just done what he had asked in the first place.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>Yeah, you would be nervous. I would be nervous, too. The question is, though: how probable is it that Brown *jumped through the window of an SUV, fought with a police officer, and then tried to grab his gun* all because he was nervous. As I said, this is excluding the fact the cop had already told him that he just wanted Brown and friend to get out of the street. Because, lets face it, when you take that into account, the scenario seems even less likely.\\n\\nBasically, it is a **huge** leap that Brown was so nervous from shoving a guy for cigars (repeat those last 9 words before this next part) that he tried to fight a cop for his gun even though the cop said he only asked him to move out of the street.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

High level of education, highly efficient administration effectively invests into the society, providing multiple incentives and angles of growth.  \\n\\nPeople have trust in their government, in their administration and how their taxes are used. This leads to a high level of security; problems are laid off them and ultimately this leads to a high level of happiness.   \\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report  \\n\\nLow level of income inequality, high GDP and PPP per capita, liberal laws, low crime, low corruption, good healthcare, great education, low pollution.

Ask Me **Anything**.  It\\'s fun and interesting to see them negotiate the comments, with the potential for them to be reading the most bizarre and funny points of view, with strange interactions on lower voted comments as well as random replies to far reaching child-comments.\\n\\nVictoria from Reddit turns the medium into yet another \"send in your questions and we\\'ll pick the best to ask this person who is so much better than you\".  Instead of interacting directly with someone, there\\'s a filter.  A filter who types the same way in every AMA, using *italics* and -laughs- and -umms- which completely takes away from it for me.\\n\\nHere Victoria says that the Woody Harelson AMA would have turned out differently:  https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fgsv2/i_am_victoria_from_reddit_amaa/ck91rpw  Which shows that comments are being filtered.  That is what made AMAs so great, it\\'s a celeb being talked to directly, and this is more often POSITIVE rather than that negative example.\\n\\nIn essence I think Victoria turns it into a basic interview with fan questions that has been done a million times before.  If a brand wants to promote via AMA, jump in and get dirty.   I don\\'t even read AMAs anymore if it\\'s got Victoria doing the typing.\\n\\nIf there\\'s a better way of looking at this , please CMV, I want to enjoy AMAs again without the frustration.\\n\\n-----\\nReason for view change:\\n\\nI still dislike AMAs with Victoria, and am clearly not the only one.  This comes from Victoria creating a difference between the celebs and us average Joes.  Of course this isn\\'t always the case.  As it turns out, Victoria will help anyone that fits in her schedule.  So in reality it is just some AMAs (Ludacris as a recent example) that may turn out far more interesting if they had to navigate the website themselves in exchange for publicity.\\n\\nWith a few people commenting with first hand experience, I\\'ve decided that because the benefits of Victoria are more heavily weighted by the majority, my post title view has been changed.  Even if I\\'m stuck hating the AMAs, Victoria doesn\\'t \"ruin\" them.\\n\\nThanks for all the replies!\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your overlords.

The whole point is to promote whatever book, movie, charity, project etc. they are working on at the moment. Without a Victoria protecting them, they risk turning a marketing event into a PR nightmare. No one wants to be the next Woody Harrelson. \\n\\nSure, it makes for pretty tame crap, but marketing is the only reason celebrities go on talk shows, do AMA\\'s, or give interviews at all. It\\'s either this or nothing. Remember, Reddit is a business. It is owned by the 44th largest private company in America. It is just as invested in promoting products as any other media outlet. As long as people watch the Tonight Show, read AMA\\'s or flip through People magazine, this is how it\\'s going to be.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>But you have to remember that the USP of the AMA was that it was out of control of the PR team. Just explaining to the OP what point Victoria serves, which he already seems to understand, doesn\\'t constitute much of an argument.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>&gt; the USP of the AMA was that it was out of control of the PR team. \\n\\nThe *questions* are out of control of the PR team, but the PR team can very much be in control of the answers. It\\'s not like we can force celebs to go into a locked room by themselves and answer everything, most celebs\\' agents would probably recommend or even insist that all the answers be vetted by someone before being posted.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>Condè Nast let go of reddit a few years ago.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>Conde Nast and Reddit are both owned by a larger company called Advance Publications.

              "     'content': '<original_post>Recently, I looked up Perez Hilton because I had no idea who he was and I kept hearing his name, and I was annoyed right off the bat. Looks like he tried to fling mud on Ariana Grande (alleging that she took coke at a party) which lead to nasty comments and threats by fans of her towards Hilton. After a while, she complied with his request and told her fans to chill out.\\n\\nIt drives me nuts that this sort of shit happens as though people that like a certain celebrity are dogs that can be called off of their attack when the center of their infatuation says they want it to end.\\n\\nIt insulates evasive pussy conduct like that of Hilton, and makes celebrities look like the bad guys if they refuse to call the fans off, making it look like the celebrity sicced the fans on them in the first place.\\n\\nWe’re left in this surreal area where celebrity targets are making efforts to protect their shit-talkers, which they should have no obligation to do. Grande sings songs, it’s not like she’s a mob boss.\\n\\nBut this is just a case study, there are probably thousands of examples similar to this.</original_post>\\n\\n<comment idx=1>So your specific case is a bit different in the sense that Perez Hilton acted in a really crappy way like that. \\n\\nBut here\\'s the thing about fans. A subset of them for any given person, book or group is toxic. And some of them are fanatically so. There\\'s nothing at all you can do to alter that fanaticism and they take a critique (legitimate or not) as an attack against the object of their fandom. That can cause them to lash out in ways that are just not ok. For a good example take those manic Marvel fans who made threats to harm/sexually assault/kill Elizabeth Olsen for not putting a black mark on her social media when Chadwick Boseman died. That\\'s a level of mad people don\\'t abide. \\n\\nNow a manic fan for the most part can be stopped with one thing. Proof their idol wants nothing to do with their behaviour. If Marvel or Boseman\\'s family comes out saying \"All those people saying these despicable and horrible things; we don\\'t consider you fans, we don\\'t condone your behaviour and we actively condemn it.\" That\\'s incontrevertible proof to these starstruck fans that their idol rejects their behavior. \\n\\nWe could argue this all day but I think it\\'s fair to say someone who threatens a woman over this and then doxxes people who defend her are too far up their own ass to see their behavior as wrong; and as long as they maintain the illusion that this is ok they keep doing it. But a statement from the person they \\'support\\' saying what they are doing is not ok is an easy way to stop the behavior dead in it\\'s track.\\n\\nI don\\'t think people think Perez Hilton was right for what he did. But letting people send death threats and constantly harass him isn\\'t beneficial.  \\nAnd when fans start going after people who did nothing wrong it\\'s even worse.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>I like your response.\\n\\nIt’s polite, yes, but I don’t see the imperative. I’m not one to villainize a complicit party even though others are the opposite.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>I mean yes and no. The initial hounding is the fault of the fans, they are the ones who choose to commit acts of violence. But as I said. The person is in a unique position to staunch the bleeding immediately and more effectively than anyone else could at that time.\\n\\nLet\\'s do a scenario.\\n\\nI (the idol) see a group of rabid bulls (the fans) stampeding towards another person on the street. Next to me is a button (my statement denouncing my fans) that will cause at least a majority of the bulls to stop stampeding. If I don\\'t press it, Am I an ass?\\n\\nI don\\'t judge Ari for her fans behavior, and I\\'m not particularly sympathetic to Perez Hilton for digging himself a lovely hole to drown in. What I judge Ari for is how she chooses to respond. Does she want to be the head of a rabid fanbase that makes online attacks their mode of communication? Does she alllow herself to be a complicit party? Or is she a good enough person to stop the hate?\\n\\nAlso as I said most people who catch the mobs are more Elizabeth Olsen and less Perez Hilton. They didn\\'t wake up looking for problems, problems woke up and found them.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>If you don’t press the button, sure, you’re an ass, but not an ass I’d throw in prison for it.\\n\\nYou mentioned the three alternatives: enable the fans, don’t weigh in, and denounce the fans. I would say the latter choices are morally acceptable, and the last one is nearly heroic.\\n\\nThere’s nothing wrong with complacency, and I don’t understand where people are coming from when they use the word as a pejorative.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>I don\\'t think anyone is advocating jail time if fans act crazy.\\n\\nMost are like you in this response. Like me being an ass for not pressing the button, she\\'s an ass for not stopping her fans.\\n\\nI consider stopping her fans the correct moral action. I consider not weighing in to be in the territory of being an ass; I wouldn\\'t advocate jail time for it or even a fine but I would definitely acknowledge it made her more of an ass. \\n\\nWhere we really disagree is the enabling. If Ariana Grande actively came out supporting her fans harassing people I would call her morally wrong. She\\'s no longer just complicit she is actively participating in the bullying and doxxing of others. I would shame any star, politician or person who did that and if their fans turned to physical violence (were it my choice) I would have them tried under [US Code 373](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/373) \\\\- Solicitation to commit a crime of violence</comment>\\n'}],\n",

We need food to sustain ourselves. The same can\\'t be said about people who suffered at the hands of Nazis.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>We also treated woman as inferior for hundreds of years. Just because it does happen doesn\\'t means it right. We need food to sustain our seeds, not the flesh of animals.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>It is decaying organic matter that sustains all life that grows. Thus goes the life cycle of all living things. Including bacteria. There is nuance here you don’t seem to see. We don’t compare treatment of women to bacteria for the same reason we don’t compare them to dogs. There is a scale to how we designate importance to living things - we are more inclined to crush a roach or spider than we are a cat or dog and we are more inclined to euthanize a dog than a human. \\n\\nI give these examples very deliberately because the moral justification for both comparisons are not as clear as we might like them to be. Which brings me to how I agree with you - just because it happened before doesn’t mean we should continue to do it. \\n\\nIt is morally desired to reduce suffering as much as possible but not when you trade one suffering for another. For instance, *have you considered what it would take to transition to an all plant diet?* Are you aware of the effect it would have on our economy? Our ability to sustain enough resources to go around? Our ability to feasibly feed ourselves given a society that is built around meat products?\\n\\nAre you aware of what kind of burden your moralizations will put on people? Don’t get me wrong, *we should definitely make that transition.* but we can’t make judgement calls based on ideas in a vacuum. It is a mistake to ignore the logistics that such a transition would involve. \\n\\nLet’s talk realism: meat is cheaper than fresh fruits and vegetables. I can buy a frozen meal with processed meat for the same price as a single serving of vegetables. The average person living under the poverty line in the United States has a poor diet that primarily lacks fruits and vegetables. And there are *millions* of people in those circumstances. \\n\\nI literally can’t afford to make the switch. ***And I want to.*** Am I still a terrible person because I eat meat? Am I really so disgusting to you that the nuance of there being a bigger problem with poverty and food scarcity is just totally lost on you?  I find this notion hard to swallow. I trust that you are capable of empathy because I know that your current belief very likely stems from that very same empathy. But it’s the nuance you need to temper it. Because my wellbeing is more important than a cows. Even if the world *should* see that difference in importance as closer than they do now.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>A lot of people are vegan BECAUSE they understand the importance and the consequences of switching to a vegan diet\\n\\nDo you know something like 70% of crop farmed is fed to livestock? Meat is cheaper because it\\'s subsidised to be, not because it\\'s easier or cheaper by itself\\n\\n\\nIn many ways the factory farms are more devastating to the economy of using land to feed mouths right now than whatever consequences there would be if we shut down all factory farms</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>I eat meat too, but your argument is pretty flawed. It\\'s extremely inefficient to raise crops to feed to animals just to eat the animals. There\\'s a ton of wasted energy and water in the process.\\n\\nIf the main argument is that we need food to sustain ourselves, we would just cut out the middle man(animals) and eat the crops directly.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

              "     'content': '<original_post>I believe sugar should be regulated.   \\n1) First off, Sugar *is* a drug. [It is addictive, it has withdrawal symptoms if you do not consume any over-time and has negative effects on one\\'s health; diabetes, obesity and dental issues being just a few of the issues.](http://authoritynutrition.com/10-disturbing-reasons-why-sugar-is-bad/); even [sugar-free drinks are of dubious effects on health, with acesulfame k, aspartame, sucralose and other artificial sweeteners being proved to be of dubious effects on health, unhealthy in larger quantities and possibly affect cancer/diabetes rate.](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-drinks/artificial-sweeteners/). Saying that the amount of sugar in products is one of the main reasons behind western world\\'s obesity is not unreasonable, especially as the [amount of sugar increased over the years in daily products, shifting a typical man\\'s diet severely](http://authoritynutrition.com/11-graphs-that-show-what-is-wrong-with-modern-diet/).  \\n2) Sugar is in all daily products, [the sugar industry lobby is strong](http://www.psmag.com/politics-and-law/the-not-so-sweet-side-to-the-sugar-industry). You cannot rely on the market to create a worthy competitor to sugar(unless [L-Sugar](https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-L-sugar-left-handed-sugar) becomes a thing one day) precisely because sugar is so addictive which make people buy more of the said sugary products. In worst case scenario, the only real competitors would attempt to make their products equally addictive, which is not a good thing for any consumer involved.  \\n3) You cannot trust people, especially children to make educated decisions on drugs they\\'re addicted to. Especially now, as sugar penetrated the market to the very point adults and children both are addicted to sugar, you cannot trust addicted parents to take care of sugar-free diets for their children; nor can you control children with pocket money in school shops or cafeterias. This is precisely why the move should come from above; if you\\'d, for instance, try to make an alcoholic a non-alcoholic the first thing you\\'d do is move away the alcohol from him, not just try to convince him it\\'s unhealthy while he\\'s surrounded by alcohol in every kitchen shelf.  \\n4) Naturally, sugar regulation would likely have dire short-term effects, especially on the economy, but in the long-term it would help the society, serve to deal with obesity, dental issues, diabetes and more and would as a result yield a healthier, and thus more productive society. It is therefore in the state\\'s interest to intervene on this subject if they care for the long-term economy and society.    \\n5) That said I am uncertain what would be the most optimal way to regulate sugar; removing sugar from schools and banning selling soft drinks to &lt;13 year olds seem a decent move - something alike was introduced in [Russia](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2923705/Children-banned-buying-fizzy-drinks-Coca-Cola-Dr-Pepper-Russia.html). ~~Introducing a sugar tax for sugar products could be another way.~~(Nevermind because this would affect raw sugar, not my intent) The most radical but probably the most effective way would be to regulate amount of sugar per 100 ml/100 g/3.5 oz in all products sold and reduce it to a reasonable level like ~5 g/0.2 oz(5%~) with an exception made for pastries and other wholly-sugary products; something alike was introduced, albeit only for children in [UK](http://www.epha.org/a/2554).  \\n6) *added point to clear confusion* Since sugar is essential to most diets in reasonable amounts, I do not suggest a sugar ban nor a reduction that would affect raw sugar. I merely advocate regulation of added sugar where its presence is not necessary, such as soft drinks and most market foods with added sugar but NOT e.g. pastries and NOT regulate natural sugar products such as fruit/juices. I do NOT wish to regulate carbohydrates, merely added sugars.  \\n7) Assuming drug regulation of alcohol, cigarettes and other drugs both soft and hard is valid for their respective health and societal concerns, sugar is comparably uncontrolled in terms of regulation and therefore deserves more regulatory attention especially considering comparative health and addiction risks.  \\n8) I admit I did not consider basic foods in the equation, I mostly was concerned with added sugars in sugary drinks and foods that do not require it in large amounts, such as cereal, yoghurts etc and not basic foods such as bread.\\n\\nThat said I believe sugar should be regulated.

As long as I\\'m informed of the consequences, what business is it of yours if I shovel sugar into my mouth 24/7?\\n\\n&gt;Here\\'s a few sources on withdrawal symptoms:\\n\\nYour sources leave a lot to be desired, especially if they\\'re the cornerstone to your argument, considering one is literally a blog listing \"possible\" side effects that are so vague literally anything could cause them.  \\n\\nYour other source cites a study done on rats (not humans) after depriving them of food for 12 hours each day.  It makes sense that the rats would prefer calorie-dense food, as that would give them the best chance for survival in the short term.  That doesn\\'t demonstrate that it\\'s addictive, only that rats prefer it to normal food when starved.  Hardly the most conclusive evidence you could provide.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>It is the state\\'s business that you are a healthy, productive member of society.  \\nNaturally you may disregard such care and do so regardless by eating said raw product(and not added sugars against which I advocate in this thread), but that argument shouldn\\'t stop states from caring.  \\nI admit that particular study might seem shaky since it concerns rats and not humans, so it may seem enough to me but I am okay with that not being enough for you.  \\n[How about this one?](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2235907/)</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>No, it isn\\'t, especially if it involves legislating my intake of certain types of food.

Floor is backwards in this post</original_post>\\n\\n<comment idx=1>&gt;I think straight male promiscuity is associated with an increased agency in life.\\n\\nI think it is as simple as \"Men don\\'t get pregnant\". You can have as much sex as you want as a man, and can theoretically never think of each sexual encounter again. Women who are able to become pregnant cannot do this. There is always a chance that they will become pregnant, so they have to include that in their calculations. Even if you remove all other considerations (power dynamics, social expectations, and so on) this would still remain for most heterosexual relationships. The man can screw and dip, the woman might have a situation on her hands. That isn\\'t the man being in more control, it is the man having different considerations.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>So you think this doesn\\'t apply to gay and lesbian relationships?</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>&gt;So you think this doesn\\'t apply to gay and lesbian relationships\\n\\n&gt;&gt; straight male promiscuity\\n\\nThat isn\\'t what we are talking about. I think that promiscuity among straight men is primarily caused by the fact that they can be promiscuous without too many negative outcomes (with the main one being pregnancy), whereas straight women who are able to become pregnant cannot be as promiscuous due to the fact that doing so greatly increases their chance of becoming pregnant.\\n\\nThis does not even take into account how promiscuous men are viewed in general (Studs, Casanovas, Players) and how promiscuous women are (sluts, whores, damaged goods). That alone has a huge impact. A promiscuous man will be lauded. A promiscuous woman shamed.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>I agree with all of this, but I don\\'t see how it relates to the notion of promiscuous males having better life skills than monogamous males. Why the situation is in place is different from the fact that the situation is in place.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>&gt; but I don\\'t see how it relates to the notion of promiscuous males having better life skills than monogamous males.\\n\\nUhh... It doesn\\'t? \\n\\nMy whole point is that I *disagree* with that assertion, and am presenting an alternative hypothesis as to the origin of straight male promiscuity. I do not think promiscuity is the result of, or impacted by, a particular man\\'s social skills or lack thereof. I think straight men are more promiscuous because they don\\'t get pregnant, and because our society encourages male promiscuity.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

I believe that the freedom of privacy is a kind of pillar of American freedom, along with life, expression, etc. If we do not have privacy we have lost among our most basic of rights. Her argument is that it doesn\\'t matter if we\\'ve lost them, because the government (see: any vested interest with control in mind) will just spy in you anyway, even after they\\'ve been caught (see: Snowden) because they can always find ways to do it without people knowing. My rebuttal is that the battle isn\\'t over until you say it\\'s over, quite literally in this case, because their only threat is us, the people who do want a right to privacy.\\n\\nI use the free speech comparison because similar things happen when the rights are infringed upon. If your freedom of speech is taken away, you no longer have the ability to voice opposition. This would result in anybody who is for free speech will be impossible to find. It\\'s somewhat similar to what happens today with social media hugboxes, the opposition gets harder and harder to find, sounds more and more crazy with each day. It\\'s pretty obvious where this leads. I compare this to right to privacy because too much surveillance means somebody is more hesitant to do natural things, like criticize those in power. Especially when your country is like the USA which has a long history with torture, but that\\'s another story. \\n\\nThe point is, I understand that the idea that we have privacy in this age is laughable, but that very idea is exactly why you can\\'t just roll over for it. It\\'s a constant battle that must be fought; it\\'s somewhat unfortunate that it\\'s that way, but always revel in the fact that those rights even exist in your mind because without them, you\\'d have no idea what you\\'re missing out on.\\n\\nFeel free to ignore the rambling and just try to sway me.

They\\'re kind of one and the same, if you give up free speech, you won\\'t be allowed to voice dissent when Big Brother shows up to watch you in the shower, just to be sure you aren\\'t doing anything wrong, I mean, why would you when *you have nothing to hide?* ;)\\n\\nThe right to privacy is not limited to \"what cops are allowed to do to find those committing wrongdoings.\" It\\'s the idea that a man should be able to sit at home, by himself, without wondering if he\\'s being watched. He might mutter to himself about how he hates how money runs the country and the people don\\'t matter. But uh oh, here comes the thought police, \"*WARNING, DETECTING USER DISSENT, EXECUTING PROCESS 25*\" \\\\*lasers*</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>Your argument in the title is:\\n\\n 1. People should object to loss of right of privacy even they don\\'t commit crimes.\\n 2. People should object to loss of freedom of speech even if they don\\'t say things that would be considered unacceptable.\\n 3. The above relationships are the same, thus they are both right or both wrong.\\n 4. 2 is right, thus 1 is right.\\n\\nMy argument is that premise 3 is wrong, since in 1. A crime has already been committed, whereas in 2. Something that was previously permitted is now illegal. That is substantially different.\\n\\nIn your comment you are saying that allowing data to be controlled will lead to losing all your other rights.\\n\\n Firstly, that is a totally different argument than your title. \\n\\nSecondly, your examples are red herrings since they only talk about what happens when you lose free speech. If you really had the goverment executing people for dissent they don\\'t need to know all your information to do that (see any totalitarian government anywhere). The problem is that they are restricting free speech, not that they are intruding on your privacy. \\n\\nThirdly, to be consistent that means you think anytime we make more information available to the government, we are losing other rights. Do you also believe compulsory census is causing us to lose rights, which allows the government and researchers to better tailor social programs? What about tax info IRS needs to do its job? What about traffic cameras which allow the government to better predict traffic flow and make your commute faster? Is that making you a peon of the government?</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>&gt; People should object to loss of right of privacy even they don\\'t commit crimes.\\n\\nI never said anybody has to commit crimes. You can be for right to privacy without being a criminal.\\n\\nI will admit that I changed the argument in my comment, that wasn\\'t my intention. However, here\\n&gt;since in 1. A crime has already been committed\\n\\nYou state that a crime is the only place where privacy exists. (In order for there to be a loss of privacy, a crime must be committed.) I suppose the real problem is when governments are not transparent about their activities.\\n\\n\\\\*To add to the above point, things like census info, tax info, and traffic info are targeted at a singular subject with a limited scope of data they collect (they are designed specifically to BE limited in that regard). What we have in the surveillance Snowden spoke of is potentially unlimited specificity from data sources that encompass well past the majority of all modern communication. Additionally, in the examples you gave, the government tells us of what information they are collecting and the methods of collection. Obviously transparency was strictly against protocol when it came to management of this new surveillance.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>In your own comment, \"nothing to hide\" implies you aren\\'t a criminal. Obviously you can have a right to privacy without being a criminal.\\n\\nMy point was in 1. The loss of privacy does not turn a legal action into an illegal action, it instead gives more powers to cops to investitgate those actions. Whereas in 2. Freedom of speech being curtailed means a legal action (saying your mind) is now illegal, which is a whole different ball game.\\n\\nFor the last point, you are saying a general principle that more information for the government curtails our rights. If you don\\'t think that is true for small scale, current programs, you have to justify why it is different for large programs. Where on the scale from census to traffic cams to credit card data to cellphone metadata to reading all your texts does it go from benign to harmful?</comment>\\n'}],\n",

They simply believe in whatever their parents believe. If you're a theist reading this, ask yourself whether you'd still follow your current religion if your parents were Islamic?\\n\\nYou can speculate yourself, don't you think its more likely that you would be Islamic too? If your parents were Hindus, wouldn't you be a Hindu? If your great grandparents were Sikhs wouldn't your parents and in turn you also be a Sikh?\\n\\nIt may not be true for all but its true for an overwhelming majority of people.\\n\\nEdit: I'm getting some answers asking about people who convert or have non religious parents, my views don't apply to these people</original_post>\\n\\n<comment idx=1>Could you clarify why you hold this view? At present, it seems like your justification is:\\n\\n1.) People are likely to have the same religion as their parents\\n\\n2.) Therefore, their parents must have been pressuring them to do it.\\n\\nIs this an accurate assessment of your view? If so, it’s missing a crucial step. People could have similar beliefs to their parents for a variety of reasons. They could have been presented with impartial information about God from their parents or other people and be convinced that way, no pressure needed. Or perhaps their attendance at church/mosque/synagogue etc convinced them by their peer group there. It’s possible a conversation with someone outside their peer group, like a pastor, convinced them to go to church, for instance. Heck, some people get their own personal experience of God, independent of whether their parents are religious.\\n\\nAll of these, and more, are reasons someone might have the same religion as their parents. How did you eliminate these possibilities and settle on your one, overarching peer pressure from parents reason above all the others?</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>That's not exactly my view, my bad for not explaining properly. Its more like;\\n\\nfor the vast majority of people who follow the same religion as their parents, don't truly believe in their religion as they would have most likely followed their parent's religion even if it was a completely different religion.\\n\\nIn such a case, one may believe that they truly believe in Jesus, but in an alternate reality where this person's parents are Hindus, they would believe that they truly believe in Hindu deities. Such a person doesn't truly believe in any religion and is rather blindly following their parents' religion. My view is that this is true for most people that follow the same religion as their parents.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>Your view is still unexplained. Specifically:\\n\\n&gt; for the vast majority of people who follow the same religion as their parents, **don't truly believe in their religion** as they would have **most likely followed their parent's religion even if it was a completely different religion**.\\n\\nEmphasis mine. The conclusion that they don’t really believe is not supported by the fact that people are more likely to follow their parent’s religion. That’s because there are several reasons why someone might follow the religion of their parents that are because they truly **DO** believe, like being genuinely convinced by their parents or other peers, the influence of their community, etc.\\n\\nTo go that extra step, you have to explain how you know that those who follow their parent’s religion don’t truly believe. This seems to be a core part of your view, but your conclusion doesn’t seem to follow from your premise. What am I missing?</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>Because to truly believe in their religion, they'd have to believe in that religion regardless of their parents and community beliefs. The reason I believe that they would change their beliefs is because I asked them the hypothetical in the post and the few people I asked did realise that they would almost definitely be following their parents' religion. Genuine belief =\\\\\\\\= True belief.\\n\\nIf you are a theist, you can speculate about it too, just imagine your parents being Hindu, wouldn't you also be one and not have any relation to your current religion.\\n\\nedit:\\n\\n&gt;you have to explain how you know that those who follow their parent’s religion don’t truly believe\\n\\nbecause then they would have said that they'd still follow their current religion even if their parents' religion was different.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>&gt;Because to truly believe in their religion, they'd have to believe in that religion regardless of their parents and community beliefs.\\n\\nFirst, why do you believe this is the case? There isn't a single belief that any human being has, secular or non-secular, that isn't influenced by the beliefs of the people in their environment. If this is truly your definition of believe, then no person holds any beliefs. Is this what you really mean?\\n\\nSecond, even if that was true, the fact that they have the same belief as their parents is **NOT** evidence that they would have the same belief given different parents. To determine this, you would have to somehow take a person and put them in a completely different environment with different parents and different beliefs and see how they develop. This is impossible as you can't go back in time.\\n\\nYour thought experiment is not evidence of this either, as it's just a hypothetical. It's as easily defeated as someone telling you that they would still believe their religion even if their parents believed a different religion, and you wouldn't be able to tell otherwise.  In other words, your standard to determine whether someone truly believes is \\\\*unfalsifiable\\\\*. Basing your view on an unfalsifiable claim is as justifiable as any other unfalsifiable belief, and is illogical.</comment>\\n\"}],\n",

These fees are deceptive and can often add up to 40% of the advertised price.\\n\\nI’m tired of clicking on a $49 dollar ticket for a show to find out it’s really $70 when I go to checkout.  Or a $50/night hotel room having a mandatory $30/night “resort fee”\\n\\nSimilar policy should apply to things like hotel rooms, car rentals, phone bills and all sorts of other consumer purchased goods.\\n\\nIf a fee is variable (like shipping) or taxes, I could see that not being included in an advertised price if they can’t be reasonably determined at the time of advertising.  a TV commercial for a national brand, they could say “$499 + tax” since the tax is different everywhere.\\n\\nHowever, for sales where the tax CAN be determined, it should be included in the price.  A hotel room should advertise the total price, since the tax calculation is based on where the hotel is, and can be reasonably determined at the time of advertising.\\n\\nThis greater price transparency would greatly benefit consumers.</original_post>\\n\\n<comment idx=1>I think this would be a good idea but any regulation would have to allow for it to be made clear that the fees are different from the \"base price\" of the product or service.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>Are the fees required?

Context is key of course, but I\\'ve had someone tell me that they are Scottish \"too\" because an ancestor way back when came from here to America. Its then often met with the American spouting off dated and offensive stereotypes to show me how Scottish they are. \\n\\nI don\\'t know how many times I\\'ve come across people talking about being from this Clan or the great great great great grandson of a Clan chief. Or people proudly perpetrating redundant perceptions of Scottish people, and feel entitled to do so because they are \"Scottish\". I just don\\'t like it. Clan history is Scotland is one ancient part of it. God there\\'s so much I can say on that but I\\'ll move on.\\n\\nI\\'ve got a few Irish friends and this seems to be an even bigger phenomenon for them. I think with the troubles and Irish suppression there seems to be more \\'cause\\' to get behind, as well as the identity.\\n\\nNow don\\'t get me wrong, I can appreciate that America is a melting pot/ salad bowl culture. Your country isn\\'t as old as mine, infact we have universities that outdate your nation. So I guess in that sense communities can retain identities in different ways. Plus a lot of immigrant communities from the old world have grown round where the ships would dock. People settled together with the people they left with. So purely down to those historical/ geographical facts, I get why there is no \\'one\\' American identity.\\n\\nI know that A LOT of immigrant communities experienced hardship, racism, otherism and were left to live in squalor. These immigrant communities worked hard to build sustainable lives for themselves. Forged careers and businesses that became iconic within America ie Italian food. Irish pubs etc.\\n\\nI can totally see the relevance to identifying as Scottish American, Italian American or Irish American. Unique communities, with unique identities that are deserving of their own American label. I guess this would make \\'American\\' an umbrella term? \\n\\nHowever, I genuinely find it problematic when Americans equate their ancestral identity as meaning they are entitled to identifying with the stereotypes of the homeland.\\n\\nTo use Scotland as an example. We are a very socialist nation. We have a very complicated national identity within the landscape of the UK. We face serious, and I really do mean serious, issues relating to drug and alcohol abuse. We have contributed to colonialism and we have also been suppressed. What it means to be Scottish changes drastically between the East end of Glasgow and the West End of Edinburgh. I believe my countries issues are often over simplified and over commodified on the international level. I just don\\'t like it when people misinterpret what it means to be Scottish because they are viewing it through the rose tinted glasses of ancestral love.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, I appreciate it when Americans take part in our culture. We love that yous love us. I can\\'t speak for other communities but I know across Europe, its widely accepted that its rude when Americans expect to be accepted as a part of the old countries communities. That we are expected to act excited when yous \"come home\", welcomed \"back\" so it were. It almost comes across entitled, that you assume you know us so well, when what you know has been passed down to you from generations.\\n\\nThis obviously excludes people who are dual nationality. Or are raised in 1st/2nd and in some cases 3rd gen immigrant households.\\n\\nI\\'d also like to note that there IS a distinction between journeying to view the land of your ancestors, and coming to a country and expecting to be viewed as part of that community without little to no assimilation.\\n\\nSo enlighten me, is there more to this I\\'m missing?</original_post>\\n\\n<comment idx=1>Something for you to think about with Americans-\\n\\nThe vast majority of Americans are not First Nation/native. So there isn’t a cultural identity that unifies everyone to the extend that you would have in Scotland or in most other countries, for that matter. Instead, our predecessors brought their own cultural identities with them and continued to practice them here. And communities of people with the same cultural background formed. So when an American says “I’m Scottish” or any other nationality, they aren’t claiming to literally be from that country. They are identifying their cultural nexus to a country because those are the traditions that were passed on to them. Between Americans, that is how we understand how and why our cultural background is different from our peers.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>But the problem arises when they then use that to justify or explain their actions in a way that negatively represents the culture that they\\'re claiming to be from:\\n\\n\"I\\'m Scottish, so I drink a lot of whisky\" - Scottish people may take a bit oc umbridge to that.\\n\\n\"I\\'m Irish so i hate the English\" - both English people and Irish people would have a problem with this. People who are both English and Irish would have an even bigger one.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>That speaks more to the person being an asshole in general. In general terms, that’s not how an American uses it. You don’t stop doing something that is commonly done because of a few fools who spoil things.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>>In general terms, that’s not how an American uses it.\\n\\nIt permiates through your media, though, and you see it on reddit a lot.\\n\\nIf people weren\\'t doing it often, it wouldn\\'t be an issue. When you challenge it, you just get attacked and downvoted.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>Because those people are just being assholes trying to excuse bad behavior. Stereotyping, both positive and negative, is a global behavior and not exclusive to Americans.</comment>\\n'}],\n",

              "     'content': \"<original_post>_____\\n\\nDuring a self-defence class I attended, the instructor demonstrated several techniques for women to use when attacked by a rapist. He explained that the positions a male rapist would need to assume to rape a female victim are actually extremely vulnerable from a ground fighting perspective. Correctly applied Brazilian jui-jitsu would use the attacker's weight against him and provide an opportunity for the victim to attack (the eyes, usually) and then escape.\\n\\nI'm not a martial arts expert but if this is all true, then girls should be taught to defend themselves from rape and assault, possibly in their early teens. It's not a panacea for sexual violence, I admit, but it will empower women physically and be an effective deterrent.  \\n\\nEdit: Found a Youtube video with the kind of techniques I'm talking about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D8r-wH0dkk</original_post>\\n\\n<comment idx=1>Most people are generally afraid to fight against anybody they perceive as being physically superior. For that reason, I don't think it would do much at all to teach women who don't have confidence in their ability to self-defend how to throw a punch or kick in the right place.\\n\\nMost women aren't exposed to the harsh realities of being male. What I mean is that men are taught from birth that they'll have to take the pain one way or another and they'll have to take it at %100 ferocity. It's just assumed that in a fight, the beatdown will be relentless. Even women who believe they've experienced the rough and tumble world of men don't realize that they've always been treated with kid gloves. A man who is willing to rape a woman is not going to hold back in any way and it's unlikely that she'll be prepared for the full force of his blows.\\n\\nThe best thing a woman can do is arm herself with something that is quick and works on the first shot. A gun ? Not so sure I'd advocate for arming women simply because they could be raped. By that logic, every male should be armed since the chances of him being murdered or physically assaulted is an order of magnitude higher. Then we've just got a lot more problems.\\n\\nNo, something like a tazer or pepper spray makes the most sense in my view. Not to mention that if it falls into the rapist's hands, he can't kill her with it (which a gun may convince him to do out of convenience)\\n\\nI've also noticed that people drastically over-estimate just how useful martial arts and self-defense courses are. A hardened street fighter is going to go through a weekend orange belt like butter.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>&gt;The best thing a woman can do is arm herself with something that is quick and works on the first shot.\\n\\nThe problem is, that weapon does not yet exist, and a firearm is the closest you'll get.\\n\\n&gt;No, something like a tazer or pepper spray makes the most sense in my view. Not to mention that if it falls into the rapist's hands, he can't kill her with it (which a gun may convince him to do out of convenience)\\n\\nTasers are really finicky, and generally a bad idea to rely upon if your life is on the line. If your attacker is wearing thick clothing, it won't work. If the prongs land too close together, it won't work. If you only hit with one prong, it won't work. If the attacker is under the influence of drugs, may not work. Also, if you miss, you only get one shot.\\n\\nPepper spray is just as likely to get you as it is your attacker, especially if it's outside and there is any sort of wind. It's also not super incapacitating, and people can be trained to fight through it.\\n\\nIn a situation like that where you NEED to defend your life, if you can draw a taser or pepper spray, you can also draw a gun, and that's what you should be using.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>&gt; In a situation like that where you NEED to defend your life, if you can draw a taser or pepper spray, you can also draw a gun, and that's what you should be using.\\n\\nExcept a gun raises the stakes.  You draw a gun, you have to be willing to kill, not everyone is willing to do that.  And if things go wrong, the chances that you end up being killed go up greatly.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>&gt;Except a gun raises the stakes.\\n\\nI think that's heavily dependent on the situation at hand. To me, if you're in a situation where you need a taser in order to stop what is happening to you, that's what I would consider to be life-or-death already. I think both a taser and pepper spray already raise the stakes, especially if it's already violent.\\n\\nIn the situation that /u/Funcuz was describing, with the male attacking a female with basically full force, that is a life-or-death situation and needs to be handled accordingly.\\n\\nPersonally, I'm not a huge fan of relying on the kindness of my attacker to spare my life.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>&gt;  think that's heavily dependent on the situation at hand. \\n\\nI think in most situations a gun clearly raises the stakes.  Obviously if the attacker already has a gun that's a different story, but if the person themselves introduces a gun where there wasn't one before, then the chances of someone getting killed go way up.  \\n\\nWhether the chances of *you* being killed go up or down is probably situation dependent.\\n\\nBut if we're considering a situation where an assailant surprises someone so they are already physically attacking them at close range, then if you draw a weapon there is a good chance it could be wrested from your grasp and used against you.\\n\\nNow, if it's a home invasion type of situation that may be different, as you could potentially use the gun to keep the attacker at a distance.\\n\\n&gt; To me, if you're in a situation where you need a taser in order to stop what is happening to you, that's what I would consider to be life-or-death already.\\n\\nWhy is that?\\n\\nThere are lots of times I would physically defend myself even when my life wasn't at stake.  For a physically weaker person, the use of something like a taser or pepper spray might be the only way they can do that effectively.\\n\\nWhen you consider that rapes and other physical assaults occur at much higher rates than murders, I don't think it's a reasonable assumption that if someone is attacking you that they mean to kill you.

              "     'content': \"<original_post>The current argument for the inequality between parental rights between men and women is that a woman is allowed to have an abortion because it's her right to bodily autonomy. While I agree with this argument, I believe that this argument loses all merit when artificial wombs are available. I believe that when artificial wombs are advanced enough to be a viable method of sustaining the fetus, that a pregnant woman should not be able to get an abortion, and must instead get whatever this new procedure. \\n\\n\\nI hold this view because of two main reasons. \\n\\n1. Parental rights equality would be established by forcing both genders to have no right, post conception, to get out of parenthood.\\n2. It would appease people who believe that person hood begins at conception while also appeasing the people who believe that a woman's right to bodily autonomy trump the rights of the unborn fetus.\\n\\nI believe that it is immoral to utilize abortion to get out of parenthood because it causes a parental rights inequality, and I believe this immorality is only tolerated because of the net good done by respecting bodily autonomy. When artificial wombs are viable however, the woman would maintain equivalent bodily autonomy, no longer be able to dictate whether or not someone lives or dies, and would still be on the hook as a parent post conception. \\n\\nEdit 1: To clarify, in this system people would still be able to give their children up for adoption and/or have child support payments from an unwilling parent (And in saying that I found a third reason I enjoy this proposal. It would allow for the situation where the father wants to keep the child and the mother doesn't to finally work out). \\n\\nEdit 2: I've given out one delta already and I want to put the slightly modified view up here. I still believe that abortion should be outlawed and replaced with moving the fetus to the artificial womb, but that we need to wait until artificial wombs are viable and contraception has reached the point where unintended pregnancies are significantly decreased. \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

All I see from this is an unnecessary increase in healthcare costs and a much greater number of children up for adoption. Just a net negative for society overall. Why enforce such a policy when it just makes the situation worse?\\n\\nNo one is morally responsible for the natural conclusion of a fetus separated from the mother who does not want it, which is the death of said fetus.</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>&gt;artificial womb procedure\\n\\nThe same person who'd pay for the abortion. \\n\\n&gt;who will care for the child\\n\\nThe parents if they keep it, the state if it goes into foster care.

Because I can think of a few choices that a person can make that just naturally lead to a death that people would find morally reprehensible.\\n\\nThe way I see it, the mother is actively keeping the fetus alive with her body (often against her will). Getting an abortion is the mother's decision to stop actively keeping the fetus alive. Deciding to stop keeping something else alive when you did not formally agree to keep it alive is not a morally reprehensible act. When something dies, it does not mean that everyone who could have potentially kept it alive is now a killer.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>&gt; What if abortion is a better option for them? Why force them to pick the option they don't want to deal with? Why is abortion okay now, but suddenly not okay when this new option exists?\\n\\nBecause it's only okay because it's the only option that allows bodily autonomy. That's the main argument for it and the only one that has significant moral and legal weight. In this situation it's no longer the only option that allows bodily autonomy therefore it loses it's most valid argument for being allowed.\\n&gt;formally agree to keep it alive\\n\\nYou did when you had sex. Consent to sex is a consent to all of the likely outcomes of sex. So you did consent to giving it life. It was your choice that brought it to life. \\n\\n&gt;When something dies, it does not mean that everyone who could have potentially kept it alive is now a killer.\\n\\nAnd when you set up a situation where someone's life is now in your hands and you decide to NOT keep them alive you have killed them.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>&gt; You did when you had sex.\\n\\nAnd that's where we fundamentally disagree.

              "     'content': '<original_post>This is inspired by a recent Movie Fight debate about what is the best movie trilogy (check it out from YouTube). \\n\\nI\\'d argue, that even though I LOVE Lord of the Rings movies, and have seen them dozens of times, it is not a good movie trilogy. For one simple reason: the movies do not work separately. \\n\\nI think for a movie trilogy to be good or better than most, the parts of the trilogy have to work both individually as single movies and as pieces of a greater whole. \\n\\nLOTR does not work as individual films. None of the themes or storylines are resolved within a single film, with the exception of characters who are both introduced and killed within one film (Boromir, Shelob). \\n\\nLOTR films are individual films only in technical sense: they all have their separate release dates, each one ends with ending credits, etc. But the story contained in these films does not work when viewed as a single piece, because you do not get to see the big picture. LOTR films are really a single film, single story, released in three separate parts. \\n\\nI think for a trilogy to be good, or great, any single movie in it has to work without any companion pieces. Sequels should not be requirements. Story cannot be truly great if it does not end. Imagine if Fellowship of the Ring was a box-office bomb, and the two others films were never released. Who would call Fellowship a self-contained, resolved film? It would still be a good film, just without resolution. Audiences would think, what then, only to be answered, nothing. A good story does not ask questions it does not try to answer. \\n\\nThen look at Godfather. If Godfather Part 2 was never released, Godfather 1 would still work perfectly on its own. Part 2 enchances the first one, and vice versa, but neither requires the other.  And no one needs the third one. \\n\\nLord of the Rings films are great. But in reality they are a trilogy only in technical terms, as the story within is one single story, not three complementing ones. If you only watch one of the films, but not the others, story is flawed and incomplete. If you watch the films out of chronological order, nothing makes sense. All the plot threads and all the character archs in the trilogy take multiple films to reach their conclusions, with the aforementioned exception of characters who are introduced and killed within a single movie. \\n\\nAn exceptional trilogy of films should work both individually, where you only see one of them (not necessarily even the first one), and still feel like you got everything you needed and wanted, and as parts of a bigger whole. Lord of the Rings films do not work without the other parts of the trilogy. Without them, story is incomplete, unresolved, and the character archs unfinished. \\n\\nCMV. \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

Now, I have no experience of any actual human beings physically hurting me or anything else that would typically make someone lose faith in humanity, but what they did collectively was enough to make ME do so!\\n\\nFirst, and most importantly, the election of Donald Trump. Ever since the beginning of his campaign, my parents had been constantly talking about how Trump was so stupid that there would be absolutely no chance that he would win the election based on how people really do think, and based on that, I made a vow to myself that I would lose faith in humanity if he won. I did. I now believe that humanity needs and deserves to go extinct because of this.\\n\\nBut that\\'s not the only reason why I believe we all need and deserve to go extinct. The other reason is the inevitable box office success of The Emoji Movie. Ever since its ANNOUNCEMENT, I thought that it was the worst idea in the history of movies and even the greatest amount of care put into it would still make me never want to watch it.

Apperant corruption on various sides does not help. \\nRegarding political issues, be it immigration policies, taxes or care, I have allways found that the answer is not found by leaning extremely to either right or left and yelling at everyone on the other side. I think \\'us vs them\\' thinking is one of the greatest challenges humans are facing, but I used to believe we can get past it by allowing both sides voices because most humans do what they think is right for the people around them. I still believe the last bit, but I have lost hope that people are able to have a civiliced discussion. I have seen attempts at peaceful mediating responded to with hateful negativity. I am no longer concinced enough people are willing to see other\\'s perspectives and come to a shared conclusion or worldview.\\n\\nTo be clear: I am not looking to discuss the aforementioned discussions. I am specifically looking for arguments that there is still hope that humans can come together, admit to our own and point to other\\'s faults and talk our stuff out effectively and in a way that makes most people happy. I am hoping these will cheer me up as well as change my perspective and maybe other\\'s for the better. Give me hope!! \\n\\nFor this discussion I have assumed hate is not the answer, as it usually breeds moee hate.\\n\\n\\nTl;dr- convince me of the ability of humans to get together and talk about their problems in a healthy and peaceful way without responding to any individual or group with hate. \\n\\nEDIT: This got more responses and I have less time than anticipated.

Far too often we let national politics define our views of politics in general, but a great deal of policy is made on the local or state level.

But as a foreigner, you could also pick a few localities to start reading about.

Really, it\\'s semantics because I\\'m thinking of \\'humans\\' in general, only I only know Dutch and American humans in that sense, I don\\'t know a lot about other politics.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>I guess I would still urge you to get involved in politics, then. I know next to nothing about politics in the Netherlands, but I would imagine there are ways for you to get involved, right? Is there a party you could volunteer with at the local level?

Goldeneye\\n\\nUnlocking characters after long lengths of play has been a part of games since forever. In Super Smash Bros. Melee you'd have to complete 1,000 online matches to unlock Mr. Game and Watch (or spend dozens of hours completing difficult challenges). Mortal Kombat's Crypt system also had players playing for dozens of hours to accumulate credits to spend to unlock characters at the Crypt. Age of Empires and MOBA's have some characters/civilizations on free rotation, but you must pay money or grind countless hours in order to unlock characters/civilizations.\\n\\nUnlocking characters or weapons by paying money instead of grinding to get them has been part of games since microtransactions have been a thing. The combination of the two has been a thing for just as long.\\n\\nThe outrage against EA is just part of another gaming echochamber source of outrage against another industry standard being blown out of proportion by an ignorance of looking at how things have been.

League costs nothing to play. Team Fortress 2 is free. \\n\\nHow do you justify a $60 price tag for the least complete version of a game before you even have access to the microtransaction storefront?</comment>\\n<comment idx=2>To me it's the same way that you justify having characters locked behind crazy grinds. The Mr Game and Watch example is the most notable to me. 1,000 matches is quite a bit and sparked none of the outrage.</comment>\\n<comment idx=3>The issue with Star Wars Battlefront 2 is making gamers pay for what they already bought. There's a big difference between a progression system that is designed to make the game rewarding to play, but incidentally made it worse, and a progression system that basically is designed to be a paywall for something you already bought.</comment>\\n<comment idx=4>Fighting games are $60 and you must pay money to get other characters as DLC. Paying for other characters in MOBA's is often more than $60. It can be in the realm of hundreds of dollars to unlock all characters within the game. Call of Duty has pre-order bonuses which give you high-level weapons on day 1 or speed up the process in which you level up to unlock other weapons.</comment>\\n<comment idx=5>But Vader isn't DLC, he's a main character and is already in the game. This isn't a character the devs built after release and are now selling, its a main character already in the game, who is functionally behind a paywall.\\n\\nAnd day 1 DLC that unlocks content is also BS, people just care less because CoD does not have the same level of excitement that BF2 does.</comment>\\n\"}],\n",
