    <title>CMV: I believe that, to vote, people should prove a degree of selflessness (shamelessly stolen from starship troopers)</title>
    <original_poster>incruente</original_poster>
    <original_post>I believe that democracy is the worst system of government we have...except all the others (another shameless theft of a quote). But, like all things, democracy should be tempered with wisdom. There are already requirements to vote; being an adult, being a citizen, not being a felon (in some cases). I think that, in order to vote, you should have to prove that you have the interests of society at least partly in mind. In the book starship troopers (which is on the recommended reading list for the navy....weird much?), you have to serve society in a real, tangible way in order to vote. In the book, it's referred to as "federal service". In real life, I think the Swiss have it (mostly) figured out: mandatory military service (but for men only, which is why I said "mostly"). But for those unwilling or unable to perform military service, perhaps other public service for, say, two years; work as a 911 operator, or even for public works. But have a job assigned to you and serve the people, to prove you're not totally selfish.

Thus, the voting body is made up of people who are provable capable of giving of themselves for others. No other rights or privileges would separate the voters from the nonvoters. 

As an added bonus, if we did mandatory military service, we could have an unbelievable state of military readiness in this country. Imagine if even 50 percent of all our people were armed and had combat training. The military would be massive, but could serve a lot of functions; municipal construction, disaster response, even things as mundane as sorting recycling. Believe me, the military already does a lot of mundane stuff. Imagine a country where everyone that chose to serve would be trained and equipped to serve their country, and every person that voted would have proven that they had the best interests of society at heart.

    <text>How would you solve or justify the fact that this system would fundamentally deny the physically disabled the right to vote?</text>

    <text>It wouldn't. I can think of a dozen worthwhile things for a disabled person to do.</text>

    <text>Yes, but your proposal calls specifically for someone to serve time in the military in order to gain the ability to vote, which simply isn't physically possible for certain people. </text>

    <text>It isn't physically possible now because of mandatory fitness, but realistically a good portion of military jobs are non-combat roles in administration and logistics and the like. Lots of military "desk jobs" to be had. If military service was actually the only way (even in Starship Troopers they don't say it's the *only* way to become a citizen, just *the quickest* way), there's no reason those with physical disabilities need be excluded (Hell, the recruiter in the movie adaptation was missing his legs.)</text>

I'd say that covers the physically disabled fairly well</text>
