    <title>CMV: Superhero movies would be better as animated films, and the only reason animated superhero movies aren't made more often is the Western belief that animation is for kids</title>

    <original_post>[The new Spider-man trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii3n7hYQOl4) just dropped, and it looks amazing. Watching this trailer got me thinking, and I now believe that live action superhero movies as a genre have a lot of problems that could be resolved by simply going down a route that includes animation. I'll list a couple of them:

1) **Art direction.** Great comics feature great art. Often how a comic is drawn says just as much about a story's theme as the actual narrative itself, and can contribute a great deal to a tone or sense of style. As a result, comics as a medium rely on their art just as much as their text to convey story, and many of the best aspects of superhero stories get lost in translation onto the big screen. Marvel produces comics that feel unique and distinct from one another, but their movies feel remarkably generic and often fail to set themselves apart. On top of that, **no** studio has successfully captured the bright, engaging color palette of comics in their live action films: technical constraints aside (I'll discuss those later), these things simply don't look as cool or engaging in real life as they do when slightly stylized. As a result of all of this, the resulting movies have a weak art direction. I believe a move to animation would help solve this problem, but I'd also point out that the tone problem in comic book movies is caused by a lot more than just their art style. To fully understand the problem, we also have to look at...

2) **The influence of big budgets on Hollywood blockbusters.** As a general rule of thumb, the more money goes into a movie the more your investors will want creative control of the project. The result is that high-budget movies often take very few risks and rarely achieve a unique vision, mostly preferring to stick to a proven formula. (This is why Hollywood is cranking out all the sequels and reboots you see these days: New IPs are seen as a sucker's game). DC makes animated movies with much less reach then their live-action films. They reportedly cost around 3 mil to produce according to industry figures I've talked to. Now, some of these movies are terrible and *none* of them have the quality to be mainstream smash hits, but I'd say that even the middling entries in their animated franchise are better than something like Suicide Squad. At lower price points animation is pricier than live-action, but as you approach the most expensive movies the needle swings in the opposite direction. For instance, Frozen reportedly cost 150 mil to make (including marketing) while Age of Ultron cost 250 mil (not including marketing). By moving to animation, Marvel and DC could emulate Disney proper and Pixar by making varied films while still playing it safe enough to rake in the cash.

3) **technical constraints.** Simply put, the action and aesthetic of superheroes simply fits animation better than live action. In order to "fit" modern special effects into live action movies, everything has to be *just so.* The constraints of these sfx affects everything from lighting to cinematography, and the result undermines the artistic quality of these films. If you need a reason for why Marvel movies are grey and DC movies are dark, look no further. Look at scenes like [this,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbpR2Oli3pg) and realize that they were done almost 20 years ago with hugely outdated technology. Yet the movement, color, framing, etc. are all miles ahead of what we can achieve even today with live action. This sort of fluidity would really make the action in superhero movies more lively and entertaining.

4) **Continuity of character.** Let's not beat about the bush here, the shareholders who own the Marvel and DC movie rights love money. Yet actors are mercurial and want to stretch their repertoire: very few A list actors intend on spending their entire careers in the cape world. If superhero movies were animated, this would present no obstacle. Both Marvel and DC are running into this problem, with iconic characters forced out of play because of real-world actor fatigue. In Marvel's case this isn't a huge deal because we've grown to know these characters well enough that a story about their departure works on an emotional level, but how the hell is DC going to explain Batman leaving the big screen when Affleck walks away? Issues like this completely disappear with animation.

5) **Distancing these stories from reality.** This might sound counter-intuitive as a strength, but hear me out. Superhero stories feature larger-than-life figures, doing larger-than-life things. By portraying these events in a photo-realistic medium, these movies ultimately make even the most outlandish heroics feel small and hollow. It's no accident that the best superhero movies like The Dark Knight Rises and Logan work with this effect rather than against it. Both movies deal in real-world themes, and while the *characters* and *plots* may be outlandish the *emotions* and *stakes* hit very close to home. These are movies that benefit from real, grounded performances and refuse to rely on high fantasy, sfx-heavy spectacle to thrill or engage the audience. That's fine, but not every film can be Logan. If you want to make a Thor or Superman movie, I'd argue the best way to deliver on that promise is with animation.

Anyways, these are just the top 5 advantages I thought of off the top of my head. Go ahead and CMV!

    <text>I’d totally watch a modern, animated superhero movie, but I think live action movies would still be more fun to watch. Personally, stuff like Spiderman (the one with Tobey Maguire) were amazing, and the latest Wonderwoman was great as well. There’s just something so gratifying about seeing these movies with real people in it.

I think it’s easier to feel more emotion in live action films. A good actor can make an audience laugh or feel distressed more intensely than an animation can because an audience could more closely relate to a real world depiction.

Continuity of character is a fair point, but most live action movies change actors over time(and to an extent, animations can change art styles over time too). The role of James Bond has been played by several actors over the years, which each produced their own unique movies. In fact, it could be quite enjoyable to watch each James Bond and see which ones you liked the most.

Art direction is an interesting point because I would argue that live action movies are more flexible in art direction. Bringing a comic to life brings a whole new artistic element that an animation wouldn’t be able to bring to the table. Also, many people watch live action films to see these heroes come to life, and having real world depictions of these heroes fighting bad guys makes them feel that more realistic.</text>

    <text>I agree about the emotion, but only up to a point. I think animation is far better at emotions than anyone gives it credit for, and this is mostly because of the contexts in which animation usually gets used. An animated film will have as much or as little emotion as you put into it, and since animation is usually used for relatively superficial children's films the emotions are often over-dramatic and not very true to life. Look to someone like Miyazaki or Takahata, and we can see incredible emotional depth in animation that comes from intense study of human behavior. And this isn't just a Studio Ghibli phenomenon that only eastern masters can achieve: the opening shot of Up is a great example of a hugely resonant emotional scene in western animation done for a mostly young audience. Animation is maturing as an art form, and in the process it's gaining all sorts of emotional resonance. 

Also, if these films want to justify being live action with this reason they should do a better job of conveying emotional stakes or making us care. I'm more emotionally invested in the average pixar film than I am in the average marvel film, simply because pixar actually works on building story and character while marvel mostly engages us by blowing shit up. There are very few moments in the superhero cinematic universe that have landed with any emotional weight for me. 

As for your second point, I don't think Marvel will decide to Bond these characters. I can't imagine anyone else playing Captain America but Chris Evans; I can't imagine anyone else playing Iron Man but Robert Downey Jr. Even if they did go this route, I feel like something would be lost. For all their failings on a story level, Marvel is telling a larger narrative that tries to be continuous. You don't need to have watched Goldeneye to appreciate where Bond is coming from bond is in Casino Royale: you kinda do have to have watched Iron Man 3 to appreciate Tony Stark's position in Civil War. 

Your last point is 100% a subjective one. I'd urge you to look into just how flexible animation is though: I think on art direction you don't appreciate just how much can be achieved these days.</text>
