    <title>CMV: I consider the Nordic model the best socio-economic model to base a country around &amp;amp; the best compromise between the right and left</title>

I believe the free market combined with a social safety net reduces poverty which benefits everyone. High level of education, highly efficient administration effectively invests into the society, providing multiple incentives and angles of growth.  

People have trust in their government, in their administration and how their taxes are used. This leads to a high level of security; problems are laid off them and ultimately this leads to a high level of happiness.

Low level of income inequality, high GDP and PPP per capita, liberal laws, low crime, low corruption, good healthcare, great education, low pollution. What's not to like?  

But all this does not obstruct high profit businesses from investing and all that is asked from businesses is that they treat their employees with respect and pay them enough so they can make a decent living. True, most thrift-based businesses would be discouraged from investing but Imo in the developed country there should be no place for such an exploiting business style.  

My only doubt is whether such a model could adapt to a larger country because in all Nordic cases we deal with low populations, large areas and often, decent levels of natural resources and admittedly this does create conditions for easier administration and sustainable economic growth.  

CMV, thanks in advance!

    <text>So you just need massive oil wealth and a small population, that should be an easy model to apply universally.

Different situations may require different solutions.</text>

    <text>Only Norway has a sizable oil reserve(well used, might add) and the small population is not that small considering half of Scandinavia is uninhabitable.</text>

    <text>Over 5 times lower than Norway and 3 times less than UK; I don't find it that relevant for its economy as it is for Norway.</text>

    <text>It does â€” not as much, and most of it is privatized. Sweden doesn't have much oil at all.</text>

    <text>Yes, but it has been decided that Maersk should be allowed to make the most profit from it, not the state of Denmark.</text>
