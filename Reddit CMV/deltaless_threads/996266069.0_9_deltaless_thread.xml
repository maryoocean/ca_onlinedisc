    <title>CMV: There is no reason a “God” should give Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>Protagoras67</original_poster>
    <original_post>I want to disclose that I am both an atheist and a hard determinist. I do not believe in any sort of creator and I have a hard time believing in Free Will. From what I understand from a Christian perspective, God gives humans free will in an effort to test them. But what i don’t understand from their point of view is why would God do that in the first place? Isn’t God omnipotent? God could just design the universe however it wants, we could have all been programmed to behave a certain way from birth and believe in God from birth and follow one religion as opposed to having a myriad of them. There is no reason to test us, it’s completely unnecessary.

Again, I’m not challenging anyone to prove God exists, I am just trying to understand the theological logic of this.</original_post>

    <text>You mention that god is omnipotent but if we’re talking about and omnipotent god then god is also omniscient and therefore knows what you will do before you do it and thus your actions must be predetermined.

So your assumption that god is omnipotent actually ensures there is no free will. 

Of course, omnipotence is logically impossible, but that’s a separate issue...</text>
