    <title>CMV: I hate America with a burning passion</title>
    <original_poster>HoovyKitty</original_poster>
    <original_post> I am a European and I've visited America for a couple of weeks before (east coast) but I just hate America and a lot of American's for some reason. The joke here has always been that American's are fat and stupid, but I always took that joke with a grain of salt, but ever since I vistied, I've believed that statement and agreed with it fully. I hate all of the food in America and how it's bland and fattening, I hate Americans all over the internet treating America like the center of the world, I hate it when I google something and the results are about America instead of the world, I also hate the stupid (to me) measurements like pounds (written lbs??) feet, inches, miles and whatnot. Also, I don't get their obsession with guns, I've never understood how they can have so many shootings, and I get that it's a massive country, but compared to the entirety of Europe it's still insane. The thing is, there are countries in Europe and elsewhere that have way more things that I dislike about them, hell, even my own country sucks, everyone here is depressed, hates themselves and hates eachother and we still suffer from Russian influence, but for some reason America just makes me want to make fun of it and hate it way more.</original_post>

    <text>America is not that old, our foods are typically imported elsewhere. I can't think of many foods that originated in the US. So blame yourselves for coming here and making your traditional foods worse I guess. 

You haven't really demonstrated how we're stupid but ok, uropeeeens r so smawt</text>

    <text>The same meals I have in Europe are just worse in America, so what if it was brought in from somewhere else? And at least the people in my country are like 50% dipshits, by stupid I meant not understanding that other countries exist.</text>

    <text>What makes you think Americans don't understand that other countries exist? From what I can find on a quick google search, Lithuania has a significantly worse education system than the United States.</text>

    <text>&gt;  I can't think of many foods that originated in the US.

Tomatoes, potatoes, corn, sweet potatoes, ALL peppers (spicy and bell), most of the commonly eaten varieties of squash, peanuts, pinto beans, black beans, kidney beans, cashews, pecans, walnuts, cocoa (and, by extension, chocolate), vanilla, maple syrup, cassava, avocado, etc, etc

All native to the Americas (not all North America, but most are). Every single one of those foods originated in the Americas before being used in any cuisine anywhere else in the world.</text>
