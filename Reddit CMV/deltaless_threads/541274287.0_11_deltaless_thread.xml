    <title>CMV:High Heeled shoes are just as "oppressive" as the face veil/niqab</title>

    <original_post>Recently there has been a lot of objection to the niqab in western countries based on the premise that they are oppressive to women. I am ignoring the aspect of social security and focusing on the aspect that I feel is repeated over and over again on reddit and social media that the niqab is oppressive to women and thus should be banned.

In Western Society high heels are part of the culture. High heels make the wearer taller, accentuating the calf muscle and the length of the leg overall and often to make women appear sexier. However they are objectively bad for your health and can cause back ad joint pain and vein swelling. High Heels, despite being damaging to ones health are often mandatory in work environments or a cultural expectation as part of formal wear for women. Despite high heels being objectively ad for ones feet though many women choose to wear them as part of their fashion choices, but one could say some are being condition due to societal expectations for women. 

The niqab on the other is a cultural garment often used in some arab countries that conceals the face aside from the eyes. There are no countries where the niqab is mandated  (no it is not mandated in Saudi Arabia). I was reading reasons people where it and a lot of people where it because it makes them feel more comfortable and they like the anonymity.   Yes this might be due to oppressive ideology about a women needing to "hide herself" from men but again most of these women choose it. I think it's rare that a husband or father is forcing someone to wear the niqab since the hijab is much more practiced. Also the niqab  is not objectively bad for one's physical health like high heels are and does not arm to the women wearing it besides perhaps in western society getting weird stares from people

So I argue that high heels are just as oppressive if not more oppressive than the niqab but western society doesn't view it that way since the niqab is associated with islam and arab countries in a way high heels are not.</original_post>

    <text>I would agree that they are similar, but the practical social scope of coverage for the two is totally different!

Niqab wearers recieve pressure from every front at once (family, friends, society, religion) and cannot easily escape the pressure. Plus the general mobility of women in those countries is often restricted, so they can't just find some other place to go. They may only have a few close friends to confide their anxieties to. That is truly oppressing to a lifestyle-defining degree. 

High heels wearers recieve pressure from some small part of conservative society, but that pressure is easily escaped simply by disassociating with those people. There is also tons of pressure from other parts of society that go in the opposite direction. And sure, if it's your family pushing you to wear heels it would hurt to cut them off, but you will find plenty of heels-hating friends to support you. 

So while both are cultural aspects that attempt to guide your behavior, the actual effect is totally different in execution.</text>
