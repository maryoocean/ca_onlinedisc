    <title>CMV: There are no good or bad music genres, just good or bad artists.</title>

    <original_post>I get it. Rock is your favorite music genre, you hate country or pop. Whatever it is, it doesn’t make your favorite genre “the one”.

Music is like food. There’s pizza, hamburguers, sandwiches, tacos, burritos, nuggets, etc. That doesn’t make one better than the other. But there are people or restaurants that can make great delicious pizzas and others who make average pizzas. The same way, there are amazing rappers with great lyricism and rhythm, and others who use an overproduced beat and have poor lyricism. There are Metal guitarists with great technique and years of experience, and others who don’t.

And this whole “my favorite genre is better than yours” thing applies to almost everything: books, videogames, movies...</original_post>

    <text>I think it's the sub-genres that can be "bad" or "good", subjectively of course. Like I think stadium country is god awful pandering bullshit, but not all country is like that, and as a genre, has quite a bit of good work.</text>

    <text>I think this is wrongly worded. There are no good or bad subgenres, just sungenres with MORE good artists than others.</text>
