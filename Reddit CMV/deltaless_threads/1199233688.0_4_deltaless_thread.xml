    <title>CMV: America has far greater freedom of speech than Europe.</title>
    <original_poster>achicomp</original_poster>
    <original_post>My view is that free speech is factually more free in America than the European Union + UK overall. None of the following ever happens in America and never could under the US constitution:

In Austria, a woman was **convicted for blasphemy** when she called the Prophet Muhammad a pedophile. In Austria, Germany and Poland the offence carries a potential prison sentence as well as a fine.

In France, 12 protesters were **fined** for supporting the boycott of Israel.

In Denmark, a politician was **convicted for burning Korans.**

A German politician was **criminally charged** for calling migrants “scum.”

In England, a Baptist minister was **jailed overnight** for preaching against homosexuality and a man was investigated for telling a Nelson Mandela **joke**.

Also in a poll of German citizens. Only 18% of Germans feel free to express their opinions in public. 59% of Germans did not even feel free expressing themselves in private among friends. And just 17% felt free to express themselves on the Internet.

    <text>There are consequences. Society gives the consequences. People will insult you for having these views, or even your employer could fire you for them.

Just that the US government cannot jail you for saying those things, hence freedom of speech is freer in the US</text>

    <text>What about extra-judicial prisons like Guantanamo that operate outside of the legal system or stuff like cracking down on whistleblowers with ridiculous criminal charges for exposing government orchestrated crimes? Freedom of the press? 

I mean those are usually the cases where "free speech" actually matters and that is where the U.S.'s record is not as good as other countries in Europe, to put it mildly. Just because racists and fascists get more leeway on consequence free speech and the laws protecting an individuals dignity are not as pronounced as in other places doesn't mean the overall level of free speech is higher or that it is greater where it matter and that is dissent, whistleblowers, protestors and so on.</text>
