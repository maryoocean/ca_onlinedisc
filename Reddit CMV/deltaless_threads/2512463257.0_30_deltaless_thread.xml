    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>banning religious headware will just result in banning  certain children from accessing education. It will also increase segregation. Exposing children to different types of people (including those of different faiths) helps reduce stigma against those minorities.  This could have cascading effects as these isolated children grow up and meet visibly religious people for the first time at much later ages.</text>
