    <title>CMV: I hate America with a burning passion</title>
    <original_poster>HoovyKitty</original_poster>
    <original_post> I am a European and I've visited America for a couple of weeks before (east coast) but I just hate America and a lot of American's for some reason. The joke here has always been that American's are fat and stupid, but I always took that joke with a grain of salt, but ever since I vistied, I've believed that statement and agreed with it fully. I hate all of the food in America and how it's bland and fattening, I hate Americans all over the internet treating America like the center of the world, I hate it when I google something and the results are about America instead of the world, I also hate the stupid (to me) measurements like pounds (written lbs??) feet, inches, miles and whatnot. Also, I don't get their obsession with guns, I've never understood how they can have so many shootings, and I get that it's a massive country, but compared to the entirety of Europe it's still insane. The thing is, there are countries in Europe and elsewhere that have way more things that I dislike about them, hell, even my own country sucks, everyone here is depressed, hates themselves and hates eachother and we still suffer from Russian influence, but for some reason America just makes me want to make fun of it and hate it way more.</original_post>

    <text>Do you want your view to be changed? 
Post sounds more of a list of annoyances then generalizing it to whole country. No one can change your view if these annoyances/stereotypes have a negative power of you, only you can change how things affect you. 

Hate is a pretty intense emotion to settle into and is not good for the mind or body. Hate has killed a lot of people, I would start questioning why you have let it in.</text>

    <text>I mean youâ€™re not wrong, but what are the underlying causes of killing? Bland food is an unfortunate experience, and definitely is not a reasonable take to hate a country. Simply bring your own seasoning next time</text>
