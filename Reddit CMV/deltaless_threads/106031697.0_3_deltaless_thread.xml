    <title>I believe a person shouldn’t intervene in a suicide, CMV.</title>
    <original_poster>Binarypunk</original_poster>
    <original_post>Suicide is sad and horrible and I think it is very selfish. It leaves the family and friends questioning everything. I say this because I understand very well the after effects of suicide and in my line of work; I have dealt with a lot of people who have wanted to commit suicide. Over the years I have had some success and some failures in this prevention of suicide. 


But then there are my personal beliefs. I believe in freedom/free will and for personal choice, completely. For the most part it seems as though most everyone believes in personal choice, personal accountability, and the whole concept of “let me be and I’ll let you be”, “I won’t bother you about choices you make as long as you don’t bother me about choices I make” as long as they aren’t illegal. Or at least some level thereof. Eventually the thought has crossed my mind on why is it that suicide is the one choice a person makes where we feel as a collective society we must get involved in that persons personal choice, so much so that we quickly hear about very personal details of their life while talking them out of the choice. How about a harder one? A person who doesn’t want to talk about it and has completely made up their mind to do it, no matter what. We then think it is completely ok to restrain the person and force them into some level of help against their will. 


I’d like to think that for the most part we as a society believe that we should never restrain a person against their will and hold them until we as a society think they are ok to be released, who hasn’t committed a crime.  Except it seems, in the case of suicide. 


One last thing, I think I am not saying we shouldn’t try to help the person. I think I am trying to say that we shouldn’t go out of our way to restrain and hold them against their will. We can talk to them and bring up things that are worth living for and help them see that perhaps the issue at hand isn’t as big as they think it is. But at the end of the day, you can’t be around them 24/7 and we shouldn’t take away their freedoms on a chance that they might take their own life. 


This is a thought in progress, so please be nice and help me change my view.


**EDIT**

A few things I believe for clarity:


-This is for Adults, not underage people, teenage angst is a mental disorder (j/k)


-You should see about talking them out of this choice, but not force them out of this choice


-Religion and culture should never be forced upon another human


-I am also for assisted suicide, living wills, euthanasia and the right to die


-As for mental disorders, just because you have a history of depression doesn’t mean anything to me, we all have been depressed before. If you are bi-polar and taking your meds, then have at it, if you have schizophrenia or personality disorders or have taken mind altering drugs …. I assume you cannot make a decision of your own accord so we should save you.  I will waiver a bit in the mental disorders area, but I do not believe you can say if you commit suicide or try to commit that you have a mental disorder 100% of the time.

    <text>I assume you are excluding people awaiting trial/intoxicated/mentally incapacitated/underaged/who cannot suicide on their own/whose death would sufficiently harm the public.

How often do we go out of our way to keep people, even those who had attempted suicide before, under enough constraints to fully stop them from taking their own lives? Surely if they are determined enough they would try until they have succeeded? If they show hesitation, should we not take it as display of the will to live?</text>

Don't see why not. 

&amp;gt;Intoxicated


I will waiver and say those on mind altering drugs, such as alcohol should be restrained. But only while they are still under the influence

&amp;gt;Mentally Incapacitated


I'm not sure they could kill themselves. Maybe you mean they have some sort of mental illness. If so, I go back and forth on that one. I still don't want to remove anyone’s free choice. So maybe it would have to depend on the illness. If their mental capacity is that of a 5 year old then I'd say we should stop them. 

&amp;gt;Underage


Yeah, I'll say an adult. Teenage angst being what it is. 

&amp;gt;Who cannot suicide on their own


I assume you are talking about euthanasia, not murder ;-) If they ask for the assistance then I see no reason why not.

&amp;gt;Whose death would sufficiently harm the public


I may need an example on this one. 

&amp;gt;How often do we go out of our way to keep people, even those who had attempted suicide before, under enough constraints to fully stop them from taking their own lives?


I work in the military and every single time someone tries to commit suicide or even speaks of suicidal thoughts, we will lock them up under surveillance and call it suicide watch and do this for three days. They will talk to a Chaplain and/or to a mental health worker. I understand in the military one gives up a certain level of rights, but it is still wrong. My wife works for a police department (dispatch not a cop) and people will get restrained. It's not like they are talked down and then "Hey, you good? Awesome" It's more like let's talk to the person and if we see a window of opportunity grab him, we must save his life. --So it does happen. 

&amp;gt;If they show hesitation, should we not take it as display of the will to live?


If they hesitate we should continue to talk to them, yes. But no, we shouldn't take that as a sign to grab them and force anything on them.
