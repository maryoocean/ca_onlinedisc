    <title>CMV: Christianity is held together through fear</title>
    <original_poster>M1STER_B0NES</original_poster>
    <original_post>My opinion is that if the fear of going to Hell was not present in the Christian ideology, then most of the followers of the religion would not be there.

Before I decided I was agnostic, that was my only reason for continuing to identify with the religion. Then, I decided I wasn't going to let fear control me. 

All in all, I don't see how this is any different than blackmailing a person to do what you want. You present your instruction, then tell them how you will completely devastate their life if they do not follow through.</original_post>

    <text>I would argue that some choose to believe not out of fear of hell, but out of the fear of there not being a heaven. 

Not only that, but the fear of having to accept the reality which is that no one really knows for sure how the universe came to be, and the possibility of spiralling into nihilism that follows. </text>
