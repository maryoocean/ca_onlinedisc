    <title>CMV: r/childfree is a toxic sub</title>
    <original_poster>SosRashneer</original_poster>
    <original_post>childfree is toxic. The sub isn't about being childfree, its about hating children as a whole. When I see a post on childfree its always about someone hating on other peoples "Crotch goblins" or "little brats". Like sometimes the child will be doing nothing at all and they're like "ugh I hate the little fucker so much like keep your crotch goblins inside your own house."
And I never really see any thoughtful discussions going on there I always only see someone hating on some other peoples children. And when someone tries to defend the child they usually get banned or downvoted. And I understand the reasoning of a child being expensive as to not having one, but if you're complaining that they're selfish that's the parents job to fix, and annoying, that can also be fixed by the parent.</original_post>

    <text>Like any other sub, a lot of the good content gets buried under the loud, obnoxious, controversial posts. I scroll past the garbage, and participate on threads where I feel I can be useful. So no, the entirety of the sub isn’t toxic, but I can see how it would seem that way from a cursory perusal. 

Also, like the internet as a whole, happy and easygoing childfree people likely aren’t posting to the same degree as miserable childfree people who feel victimized.</text>
