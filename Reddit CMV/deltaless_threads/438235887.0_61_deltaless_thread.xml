    <title>CMV: If gender is a social construct, then so is race</title>
    <original_poster>BoppeBoye</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let us take, as a given, that gender is divorced from the circumstances of your birth, that it is not a mental illness, and that there is no biological basis for what gender identity someone should express. Have I phrased that effectively? I'm trying to be concise, but I want to portray that premise correctly.

Why, then, should race be different than gender? If race carries with it "shared experience" and "lived experience", etc - that assumes that the only way you could understand what it's like to be a minority is to have lived your entire life as that particular minority. I'm not arguing against that, I agree that there are certain experiences that I could not comprehend - for instance, overbearing &amp;amp; strict Asian parents with exceedingly high expectations. 

But, if someone can change their gender or decide (?) that they identify as a different gender without having the prior lived experience of said gender, then why can't someone identify as a different race?

I'm not able to encompass all the variables which could lead someone to identify as another gender, but is it not possible for someone to come to the same conclusion with their race? What if an Indian man grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood, saw or experienced the same (or similar) discrimination as them, had minimal exposure to Indian culture; and this led him to conclude that he identifies more closely as a black man, rather than Indian? 

I would also like to cite Rachel Dolezal, who was uniformly mocked for being (afaik) the first trans-black woman in the public eye. It seems similar to transgender discrimination to me, assuming that there is something wrong with her mentally for deciding to become a black woman... Anyway, I'm not really defending her because that's not really in line with what I described in the previous paragraph (she grew up privileged IIRC), but the public reaction of mockery goes against the leftist belief of acceptance, by my perspective.

So, in short, why can there be no such thing as trans-racial people, the same way there are transgender?

    <text>Race describes a set of physical characteristics.  So does gender, but it also describes a set of behaviors.

The only behaviors associated with race is stereotypes.  One could say the same is true for gender, but mostly the stereotypes have to do with sexual preferences (i.e. you have the preferences, then you pick the gender that "suites them", so you're understood better by society).

One could theoretically identify as a black guy if he was white, but he'd be identifying with a cultural stereotype, not the race.  A black guy can in reality act any number of ways, just like anybody can.</text>

Those behaviors are also stereotypes.

    <text>This is true but these stereotypes are useful.  They help society understand how the person views themselves.

i.e. if you see someone who's black, it's not useful to assume he's a criminal.

If you see someone in a dress, it's useful to assume they are choosing to associate with femininity.</text>

    <text>I'm pretty confident that dresses for women are a WAY WAY stronger correlation than criminal for blacks, even by blatant racists. So I think your argument becomes rather absurd.</text>

    <text>You're missing the point.  The gender behavioral stereotypes are choices, having a certain skin color is not.  They are used for self-expression.  Race stereotypes are used for pigeonholing people and basically suppressing expression.

So as an example, if a guy or a girl or trans walks into a room in a dress with lots of makeup on and bats their eyelashes at people, they are communicating something about themselves.  It's playing into stereotypes, but it's useful.

When a black guy walks into a room, nothing at all is usefully communicated by the color of his skin.</text>

    <text>I think you are vastly undervaluing the problems women have just for being women no matter how they behave.</text>
