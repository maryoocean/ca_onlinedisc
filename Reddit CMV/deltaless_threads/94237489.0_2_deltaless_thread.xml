    <original_post>I believe everyone is racist just some people are more racist than others.

No matter how tolerant we try to be we are all ignorant to certain group(s) and because of that ignorance we make assumptions about certain groups of people.


As human beings we still have the primitive instinct to attack or run away from anything that looks different than us and in this case people who look different from us.

We all make assumptions.  For example, if you live in a predominately white neighborhood and you happen to see a group of black people hanging out you will notice something is a bit off.  These black people might be law biding citizens who isn't doing anything wrong but you don't know that.  You can say the same for any race but the point is if you see something "different" it will stick out to you and everyone else.  The same example can be the other way around and there can be a group of whites in a black neighborhood and that will stick out and you'll still make assumptions.

    <text>Some people are blind or deaf, and so are unable to make any judgements about race.

Some children will have no opinions on race, and so will not be racist.

So not everyone is racist.</text>

    <text>This doesn't make sense at all. Not being able to tell what race people are, doesn't make you any less racist. You could absolutely hate a certain race, but never have seen one in your life. 

I assume your argument is that you couldn't be racist towards a specific person with these impairments. Being deaf would hold absolutely no affect over racism. You can still see what race they are. Blindness, while being a temporary equalizer, wouldn't matter once they were informed of what race the other person is, either by voice, speech, or simply being told by somebody.</text>

    <text>They can be racist, but a blind person has a much smaller range of things to be racist on.

And I was mostly talking theoretically. Many blind people may be racist, but op said everyone- some people may be blind and deaf, and so be unable to perceive race at all.</text>

    <text>I completely agree they have a smaller range of things to be racist on. Race, contrary to what some people try to claim, is more than just the color of your skin. It's your culture, your way of life. The way your parents will raise you is largely dependent on your race, generally speaking.

Obviously, not every white parent is teaching their kid how to golf, nor is every black parent forcing their kid to play basketball. However, you will be immersed in your race's culture &amp;amp; surrounded by it. Whether you like it or not, it will define you as a person. It may not be your largest influence, but it will unquestionably differentiate you from a different race, even if by a marginal amount.

Racism isn't limited to the visual aspects of a race. In fact, I'd bet very few people that are self-proclaimed racists hate a race because of the color of their skin. It's simply a quick way to tell if a person is a part of the culture they hate. For example, a klan member doesn't care if a person's skin is black necessarily, they care that "those people are causing crime &amp;amp; killing people". If they dyed themselves green, they'd still hate them. It doesn't really matter what your visual appearance is to most racists, it's the preconceived notions that come along with it.</text>
