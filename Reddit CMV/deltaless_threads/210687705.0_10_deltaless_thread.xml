    <title>CMV: I'm wasting my time and money by going on vacation overseas.</title>
    <original_poster>beq451991</original_poster>
    <original_post>I am a somewhat recent college graduate and am about to take my first trip overseas, to Italy. I have a full-time job and am taking two weeks off for this trip. Now that the trip is coming up in a couple weeks, I am wondering why I thought it would be a good idea. I don't like the idea of two weeks of not being able to workout in a gym, eating decadent food, and spending as much money as I am on the trip. I am the stereotypical American who actually likes working and I try to work more hours than other people, punishing myself in the gym (if I'm not sore after lifting weights or out of breath after cardio, it's not a workout), and eating simple foods. I am going on this trip mainly for the historical aspect, but I am afraid of living too softly and enjoying myself too much, as ridiculous as that sounds. People tell me I'm going to work myself to an early death, but I see working as my purpose in life, as a man. I don't care if I drop dead from a heart attack at 40 if I worked as hard as I could and accomplished as much as possible.</original_post>

You and I are a lot alike. Understand that this personality is in no way incompatible with foreign travel unless you make it so.

&amp;gt;eating decadent food

Yes, Italian food can be extravagant in its excess. But countryside Italian food is much more like the "simple" that you like, and it's an opportunity to expand your cooking skill set. You like working and being competent, so treat this trip as an opportunity to learn the basics of Italian common cooking. Lean how to make real pasta or how to make/eat bread with olive oil or how to identify the very basic components of traditional Italian pizza. At the very least try these dishes (and others) at a place for locals, not tourists, and experience the simple food for the everyman in another country.

&amp;gt;mainly for the historical aspect

Treat this trip as an occasion to accomplish as much as you can. Really throw yourself into what you're learning about, be detailed, write about it if it will help you remember what impressed you by seeing the historical sites. Come back from this trip as a more cultured person who realized something important about art, history, or the human condition by experience. Add something to your repertoire of stories for when you're shooting the shit with a new colleague or friend.

&amp;gt;not being able to workout in a gym

Work out while you're there. There are gyms in Italy, and if that's not convenient, kill yourself with HIIT, bodyweight exercises, and early-morning runs through the towns (one of my favorite traveling activities).

&amp;gt;spending money

Just make sure you're getting a decent return on your dollar (in experience, like paying a museum fee or a restaurant bill, but making sure you will get something out of it rather than frivolous spending). You will not regret that money spent when you look back on your trip a few years from now.

&amp;gt;if I worked as hard as I could and accomplished as much as possible

I think that's an admirable goal.

As a last note, you might enjoy picking up **The Broker** by John Grisham and reading it on the plane.
