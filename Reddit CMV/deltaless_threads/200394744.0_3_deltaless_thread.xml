    <title>CMV: There can't be hatred without fear.</title>
    <original_poster>Alpy94</original_poster>
    <original_post>To be precise, I meant hatred of group or people. 

My argument is that hatred of a group is a direct result of fear of the group. An example would be with anti-Semitism. Nazis and modern anti-Semitic groups talked/talk about Jews controlling the world and money and the power, and how they are evil and make them suffer with their power. This is a clear cut example of fear. People felt threatened by the Jews. That fear lead to hatred.[ /* Cue in Yoda */](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnFr-DOPf8) 

I thought of any form of hatred and bigotry I could think of, and I couldn't find any where fear doesn't play an important role. 

So CMV
