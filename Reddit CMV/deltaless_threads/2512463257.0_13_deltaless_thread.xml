    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>I wouldn't say i disagree since that's how school was since i went to school in France but i think that not every country should adopt it. I support this in France as Laicité is one of the most important value in France but most country in the world doesn't really need it and there many country where it would be a bad idea. I understand Quebec doing since Quebec is still relatively close to France so i don't think it's a bad idea for Quebec to follow the french exemple on this but strict principle of laicité in school can't be applied everywere.</text>
