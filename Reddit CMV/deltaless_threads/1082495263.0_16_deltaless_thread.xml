    <title>CMV: Donald Trump has taken concrete steps toward establishing a fascist regime, and "losing an election" won't be enough to successfully remove him.</title>
    <original_poster>MaichenM</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm not here to argue whether Trump will win the election, I'm here to argue that it may not matter whether he does.

Right now, what is happening in Portland is what I've come to understand through observation as Trump "flexing" against the barriers that constrain him. No one has been permanently harmed by federal agents purely because that would be too big of a step, too early. He is normalizing the relatively minor violence of terrorizing protesters without actually charging them, and priming the GOP base that supports him to readily accept more severe violence against those that do not support him.

This kind of flexing has gotten Trump really far. He throws something out that sounds insane at first and lets people digest it. Then he does a relatively minor version of it. Once that is normalized, he ups the ante.

The one that worries me the most is his continuous teasing over whether he will accept the election results, and casting doubt on the validity of the election in general. This is coupled with the fact that he still has four months to look at polls, reflect that he is losing, and decide that he must maintain his power undemocratically if necessary. Even if he doesn't come up with a plan to do so, now, there will still be a two-month gap until Biden's reelection that is usually expected to serve as a nice buffer for an orderly transition of power. I know I've mentioned plans, but Trump doesn't need a plan, here. All he has to do is say: "No." At this point, all the resources of the federal government will still be under his control, and his supporters will have already been primed to accept violence toward protesters.

For the purpose of this view, I don't need Trump to successfully install fascism in the US. If he is removed through force, I will still consider myself "right" in the sense that a peaceful election was not enough. My view will be changed if I'm led to believe that Trump will lose the presidency without necessitating violence, or inciting it for his benefit.

EDIT: I have already awarded Deltas to some people who argued in good faith. Starting now, I can't promise that I will respond to everyone, but I definitely will no longer engage with anyone who argues with me on bad faith, or uses personal insults. Thanks to everyone who has presented good arguments.</original_post>

    <text>How dare Trump enforce laws on those who are rioting, destroying cities and terrorizing the lives of law abiding citizens in those cities when the mayors and governors they've elected aren't doing anything about it. Since when is stopping radical riots and destruction a fascist trait.

When Chaz/chop or whatever was set up the people with businesses and homes there wanted it gone, they were being terrorized but nobody was doing anything. Instead it was called a "summer of love" and wasn't until people were killed did the mayor take it down. Why don't we ask citizens who aren't rioters what they want and how they feel about the destruction and   riots.</text>

    <text>&amp;gt; destroying cities

I don't believe you.  Which cities have been destroyed?  Name two of the destroyed cities you're referring to.</text>

    <text>Look at Portland as an example. Look at what happened in Seattle until finally someone had the courage to step in and restore order to those criminals and anarchists.</text>

    <text>Actually, it wasn't until the mayor house was marched upon... then it got taken down.  She were perfectly ok with it up until it impacted her.</text>
