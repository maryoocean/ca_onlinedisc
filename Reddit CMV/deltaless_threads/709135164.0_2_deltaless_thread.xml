    <title>CMV: News Reporting must strictly be as neutral and factual as possible, instead of containing the reporter’s opinions and agenda.</title>
    <original_poster>Daberinos</original_poster>
    <original_post>Sometimes, when I watch or read a news report, I find that I notice many, or at least noticeable parts of the articles are not strictly of the information of the news report, but of the reporter’s opinions of the article. This leads to the reporter changing the meaning of, warping, omitting or highlighting certain parts of a report due to either subconscious opinion or conscious agenda pushing. Hence, many times have I read a news article and realise that I have been influenced by the way the reporter phrases the facts of the situation, and even outright puts their own opinion in the article. When a person who does not consciously make sure to watch out for subliminal messaging in news reports read them, their world views can seriously be affected. A good example is the “CNN vs Fox” meme where people poke fun at the fact CNN panders to democratic audiences and Fox panders to Republican audiences, and their reports of the same incident can be wildly different, and that’s where the opinions of the writer starts to show. Obviously I don’t believe that a report can be entirely without a second-hand opinion, in fact I think it’s impossible to produce a perfectly neutral news report. However I do believe that the situation right now could be remedied into a far better state than it is now. By having a opinion-wise neutral news report, it gives the reader a chance to developed their own opinions on the subject, and if the writer would want to give their view on the topic which I agree with, it should be segregated from the facts of the news report to warn news readers that what they read will be a third-person view of the report. Thus News reports and proper discussion of opinions can be properly distinguished. 

However, some people have told me that they disagree with what I said, thus I would like to know the general consensus of how people view this view.</original_post>

What kind of thing are you thinking about, here?  This is called framing, and usually it IS kept to a minimum for established news sources.

The bigger issue, and the one your view isn't focused on at all and wouldn't fix, is agenda-setting.  This has nothing to do with *how* an issue is presented, but rather *what* issues are presented.  On any given day, there's a kabillion things happening and only so much space in the news.  The editorial choice of what to report on is the real driver of people's opinions, even if the reporting itself is neutral.

To take an example, many Fox News viewers simply don't know that Russia breached voting systems in at least two counties in Florida.  This isn't because they got that story, but Fox framed it in such a way that the viewers somehow missed the point... Fox just didn't report on it much, if at all.  Ignorance isn't the only consequence of this, because people decide what news is important by how big a deal it's made in the news; they use the heuristic "If this was important, it'd be talked about a lot."  So even the Fox viewers who know about the story are going to think it's less important than people who go other places for news.</text>

    <text>I agree with you on the fact of where some news aren’t reported because of their supposed ‘importance’ and it reminds me of the Sri Lankan Easter bombings situation which I believe you are familiar with.

To fix that I just simply recommend reading multiple news sources

However, yes I am talking about where two different news sources report a situation but produce two abnormally different reports, where it doesn’t come down to ‘this information is more important than this’ but more rather like ‘I don’t like how this information should be presented so I change it to the way I want presented’ . This is not easily solved by reading multiple news sources and absorbing all the different interpretations and seeing which one you like best. By reading a secondhand report your opinion becomes thirdhand. And that’s where I believe that your opinion must be shaped by yourself, while you use the information given to you. You do not copy the opinions of others, but acknowledge it. (Not to say your opinions can’t be the same as someone else’s)</text>

This norm already exists for most reputable news sources.  Even Fox News, during its explicit news segments, keeps this to a minimum.

So, are you talking about not reputable places like those weird sites I could find linked to on my aunt's facebook page, or do you mean the minimal extent this happens to places like the New York Times?

Like, the NYTimes will have wording things like a headline saying "Democrats scramble to respond to new abortion laws," and someone might have issue with the implications of the word "scramble," which implies disorganization.  Contrast that to my aunt's facebook page, with headlines like "Alabama governor cackles with cruel delight, casts shadow holding a pitchfork."

If your view is just that super shitty, deceptive news sites are bad, then you're not going to find much disagreement.  But if you're arguing the occasional "scramble" wording is a huge deal, that's somethign different.</text>

    <text>I get what you’re saying, but to make myself clear I’m not talking about the kind of websites your aunt visits ( which is a whole problem of its own), it’s more of misleading articles not just the titles, by popular and well known news sites. (Idk if reputable is the word to use here)

It’s hard to give an example but the simplest one I can give is ,let’s say scientists make a tiny breakthrough in this modern field, and some (by some I mean proper ones) news reports says some stuff like ‘new breakthrough is the next step in human limb regeneration’ or something and start hyping up the the breakthrough but the scientists were testing on a rat and even then it was a minor breakthrough.</text>

    <text>Oh, well, science reporting is a whole big mess (and university administrators/deans are as much to blame for problems there as journalists).  But in this example, I don't see where the journalist's bias is causing a problem.</text>
