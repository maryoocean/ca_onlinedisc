    <title>CMV: Roe v Wade was decided incorrectly</title>

    <original_post>__Rationale__

I believe that Roe v Wade was decided incorrectly by the Supreme Court. The reasoning for this is that the right to privacy should not, and could not, be said to be derived from the Fourteenth Amendment by any reasonable reading of the text. The argument given from Griswold is wholly insufficient—it cites searching bedrooms for contraceptives as an unacceptable infringement of privacy, and thereby cites the Fourteenth Amendment as the source of this right to privacy, when the amendment really does not create such a right. (As an aside, I would’ve decided it using the Fourth Amendment and declared that searching bedrooms like that is an ‘unreasonable search and seizure’) Given that a constitutional right to privacy does not exist, the case was decided incorrectly. The correct way to legalize abortions nationwide should either be legislation legalizing abortions and conditions, or a constitutional amendment adopting an amendment similar to Article 8 of the ECHR.  Change my mind.  

__Note__

This is not a post about the merits of abortion, it is a discussion of the legal merits of the judgement handed down by the Supreme Court. Any such comments about the merits of abortion will be ignored. For those curious, I support abortion rights. Further, I anticipate some arguments along the lines of ‘by any means necessary’, which do not convince me, because I have a strong belief in the Rule of Law.</original_post>

    <text>9th Amendments implied rights. You can't have a right to protection from unreasonable search and seizure without the implied right to privacy. 

Anyway, here's what I can say about the right to abortions: the government only has the powers outlined by the constitution and those necessary to effectively perform the tasks outlined in the constitution, and the right to legally force medical decisions is not given to the government. The question then becomes, what constitutes a legally defensible life. If there is no legal life to protect, the government has no authority to intervene in the private medical decisions of a woman. This is where the 25 week threshold comes into play. By this point, that is definitely a child. Prior to then, it could be argued, that it is simply a rapidly multiplying and diversifying mass of cells with no independent capacity for life and therefore, not a separate organism, but a cell growth.</text>
