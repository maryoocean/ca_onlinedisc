    <title>CMV: Respect for elders and authority figures shouldn’t be expected, but rather earned like the rest of the population.</title>

    <original_post>First time poster here :)

The idea that one should always maintain respect for those older than them, or more powerful, doesn’t seem to stand currently. And this can be perceived as largely constructive, as there is no longer blind respect for authority figures, and people are better able to speak out against oppression and injustice, even if having to stand against those older/more powerful. Additionally, this generation seems to be more critical of ideas, values and traditions held by this group of people, and this is essential in ensuring that younger or more vulnerable people aren’t taken advantage of simply because the other party is older or holds more influence.

In this case, respect should be earned, but of course, one would always be expected to remain courteous and acknowledge the fact that age is often correlated with wisdom. However, by the same token, it should be acknowledged that this is not always the case, and so it shouldn’t be expected that their perspectives are final, or correct.

However, the issue with this is that, it seems as though this general lack of respect has been emulated by mostly insolent children/teens, who act in defiance without any rational ideological backing, despite their own conviction. And this seems to be perceived as problematic in and of itself, with parenting a much more onerous task, and with the consequent diminished value of rules, laws and the like. 

So where do we find the balance? </original_post>

    <text>We've never lived in a world where people who were worthy of respect actually received it. You're referring to a golden age of respect that never really existed.

We've claimed that "insolent children and teens" disrespect elders more than the previous generation for like nearly all of recorded history. </text>

    <text>But based on my experience, I would say that there is respect for those in authority positions in a lot of the cases. Perhaps my title is poorly worded, but I would say that we are expected to give respect to the judgment handed down by such groups, whether they be parental figures, teachers, or even law enforcement bodies. 

And I would agree that this is an oft-used claim, but this respect seems to be diminishing more and more as time passes. 

Thanks for taking the time to reply! </text>
