    <title>CMV: Pride parades should have less NSFW content</title>
    <original_poster>punmaster29</original_poster>
    <original_post>To preface, I'm bisexual and I love pride month and pride parades. However, I think that the amount of inappropriate content impedes some of the intent behind pride. 

To me, pride is about celebrating the LGBT+ community and promoting acceptance and understanding. It's about not being ashamed of who we love and what we identify as, and being able to share that with the world. 

I think the parade would ideally be a great place to bring our families, to show parents and children how incredible and talented the community is. I'm not out to my family, but bringing them to Pride would be a great start towards warming them up to accept me. But generally given the amount of public nudity and sexual inappropriateness at Pride, this is pretty much out of the question. 

In order to be more inclusive and celebrate love with as many people as possible, I think pride parades should tone down the sexual undertones and focus more on the concepts of love, pride, celebration, and acceptance. </original_post>

    <text>Hey, fellow bisexual here. I’ve never answered one of these before but I’d like to try. 

First, I think one thing to note about Pride is that many people feel it’s meant for the LGBTQIA+ community and allies, not necessarily to change biased minds. While Pride could be a tool to do so, it is fundamentally a chance for an oppressed group to come together to celebrate their shared identity, and as such, I think it would be inappropriate to ask them to give that up. LGBTQIA+ folks already live every day striving for acceptance and trying to accommodate- for many, Pride is the one time they don’t have to apologize. 

2) Much of the LGBTQIA+ movement has been centered around the ability to choose what they do with their bodies. Much like Slut Walks, many people at Pride choose to use nudity to make a political statement. By wearing incredible costumes, or decorating floats, or wearing nothing, attenders send the message that they intend to be out in every way possible, and they the are unwilling to ignored. This freedom becomes even more important when we remember that LGBTQIA+ bodies have faced strict control, through the criminalization of gay sex, forced conversion therapy, the withholding of transitional medical procedures, etc. Pride is a chance to reclaim what government and society have at times tried to destroy. 

3) I’ve seen just as much overtly sexual content in other parades, advertisements, and popular films. When asking Pride to be less overtly sexual, it’s important to put it next to other similar events and consider if maybe Pride is facing added scrutiny unfairly. 

4) last, and maybe this was unique to my city, but we did have a family festival day the week before. With this context, If a change needed to be made I’d say add a family friendly day, instead of changing the whole parade, for the reasons listed above.</text>
