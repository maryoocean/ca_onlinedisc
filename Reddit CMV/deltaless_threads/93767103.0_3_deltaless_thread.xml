    <original_post>This is something I've believed for a while. As a species, humans are self-destructive. We procreate too much and consume too many resources. I believe that something like China's one-child policy should be instituted in as many countries as possible to curb population growth. ~~I think currency should be done away with and governments should provide housing and necessities while the population works for the betterment and survival of humanity as a whole rather than for monetary compensation.~~

Am I crazy to think this is how the world should be? 

EDIT: Perhaps eliminating currency would be more problematic than keeping it.</original_post>

    <text>Let me just say that technically, what you've said is very easy to disprove.

I'll grant you everything in your comment box, and still, the human species would not go extinct.  We could have nuclear war, or famine, or over-population leading to a second Black Plague, but still, life would go on.  There would be some people living in a secluded part of the world, and humanity would not go extinct.

So if you take what you said literally, then no, all of those natural human forces could never completely wipe our species out.

I think what you *really* mean to say is that humans need their rights limited to ensure the survivel of **civilization/industrial society**.  In that case, I would say that you might be right.</text>

    <text>I guess I meant society, as developed civilizations know it, continuing. Where we don't have to worry immediately about scarcity of resources.</text>
