    <title>I dont think manslaughter or any crime committed accidentally should be considered a crime. At all. CMV</title>

    <original_post>If it is proven that the offender had no intention of committing a crime, why should they be persecuted because the odds were against them? 


EDIT: Ok, many people have used the example of "what if a person is driving drunk and they kill someone?" I still think they should only be punished for driving drunk.</original_post>

    <text>Interesting. At the civil level, if a person behaves recklessly, or hasn't taken reasonable precautions to avoid harm, they are held responsible.

At the corporate level, where profit underlies all decisions, risky behaviour that affects masses of workers and consumers goes unregulated and unpunished. Negligent behaviour just doesn't exist in big business.</text>
