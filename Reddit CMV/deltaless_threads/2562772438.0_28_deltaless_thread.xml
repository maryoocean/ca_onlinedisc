    <title>CMV: It is illogical to not believe in Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>LAMARR__44</original_poster>
    <original_post>Many people either believe in Hard Determinism or Compatibilism. I will argue that both are illogical.

Both argue that human actions are extensions of factors we do not have a choice over. Compatibilism seems to say we are still free but just redefines free will to the internal factors behind a decision, but the decision is still decided by a chain of events outside of our control.

My argument is a sort of wager argument. Either libertarian free will exists or it doesn’t. If it exists and we believe in it, we have made a free decision where we are right. If libertarian free will doesn’t exist, the decision to believe in libertarian free will was out of our control.

So either we have a choice and we can make the right choice, or we don’t have a choice and were determined to be wrong.

Thus it makes more sense to believe in libertarian free will since it’s potentially the only one where we have a chance to make a right choice, if determinism is true there is no choice, so there’s no value in being right.</original_post>

    <text>I am conscious. I can reason through an argument or choice and decide on one I want to, or make choose at random. In all of this it feels like I have a free choice. It feels like I have free will.

If it was proved beyond a reasonable doubt that I did not actually have free will then what would my reaction be? What would anyone's?

How would it affect how my decisions are made?

Would I murder and steal when I wouldn't before? Because it wasn't my choice. I don't have free will.

But that's intuitively wrong. We can't act as if we don't have free will. We would just sit around doing nothing. 

We are our minds. We have to act as if we have free will. If so, what is the functional difference if we do or not?

There's also the fact that we simply have no idea how the mind works. On a fundamental level we have no real theory for where consciousness arrises from. 

You could argue that our choices are all deterministic based on our history. But again what practical use is that? We cannot predict what someone will do with accuracy. We might be able to work out what they will most likely do. The probability.

This is how thing work on the quantum level. We can't measure the exact position and velocity of a particle, just the probability of where it might be at a particular time.

The universe is not deterministic in that sense. Why should our minds be?

Our consciousness must serve a purpose, otherwise why have one. Presumably it costs energy so why not get rid of it. Perhaps it is emergent. A side effect of the advantage it brings. But more likely there is a reason it exists. 

Rather than a passenger in our own body, pretending we are steering, it seems more likely that we,  as a consciousness, serve an executive function. The body and subconscious do what they can on instinct and autopilot, and things that need more scrutiny are surfaced to the consciousness. 

There's likely no hard delineating separation between parts of your mind. Elements that move above and below, or coalesce. This also goes without diving into split brains or personalities, which imply far more complexity. 

But that asside, while many of our actions would be chosen without conscious decision, the more significant ones or more immediate or urgent ones are given to the consciousness to decide. 

You are the CEO of your mind. Not fully in charge of every small decision, and certainly not free to control everything, but with ultimate power to decide the direction of your whole self. And of course the responsibility for the choices and actions of the whole.</text>
