    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>This is a really odd situation you bring up. American isn't an ethnicity but it's a nationality, so shouldn't anyone from that nation fall under the banner of American? Similar to if me as a white dude was born in Kenya I'd be Kenyan but clearly not any of the dominant ethnicities there like the Bantu.

I think your German peers forgot the difference between nationality and ethnicity. Even after the colonialism point it still doesn't change the fact that the US nationality is called American and that's all regardless of your ethnicity or length of time or generation in the states.</text>
