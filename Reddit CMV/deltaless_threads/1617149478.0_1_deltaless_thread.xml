    <title>CMV: Tone Policing is OK</title>

Just from the get go, I want to say that I am rather on the left as opposed to being on the right or liberal. What I am about to say, therefore, is targeted as people who lean left but it is applicable to anyone. 

I have a feeling a lot people are going to disagree but here me out on this one but, I don’t really subscribe to the received definition of tone policing. If we go to my favorite source, Wikipedia, we find this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_policing). If you don’t feel like reading the whole thing, check out this quote: 

*Tone policing has been described by one writer as "when someone (usually a privileged person) in a conversation or situation about oppression shifts the focus of the conversation from the oppression being discussed to the way it is being discussed. Tone policing prioritizes the comfort of the privileged person in the situation over the oppression of the disadvantaged person."*

This to me seems a rather narrow definition? Tone policing is a lot of things. The term “mansplaining” is policing the tone of arrogant and pompous men with privilege who try to talk down to people. When we use the word “mansplain” we are criticizing pretentious men for their condescending tone. A similar case is the use of the term “Karen”. What are Karens? They are women who demand things in an overly aggressive and entitled manner or tone, right? I think that there are few rational people that would argue that men should never try to explain things, or women should never raise valid concerns about customer service. The terms “mansplain” and “Karen” exist to police tone. 

What’s more, no one likes being tone policed. Mansplainers would never admit that they’re mansplaining, Karens would never admit that they are Karening. And it’s not hard to understand why. When we use these terms, we are changing the focus of what they are they are trying to say to how they are saying it. We are not listening to them. 

But I would argue that’s OK. Because no one wants to listen to something that is being said in a rude, condescending or confrontational tone. Not your partner, not your kids, not your parents, not your teachers, not your students, and certainly not your audience. Tone policing is OK. 

But there is a qualitative difference when tone policing is done by privileged people to marginalized people, right? 

Yes and no. I understand that not everyone has equal access to power and a lot of people have perfectly valid reasons to lose their temper when someone inadvertently insults them in a demeaning and dehumanizing manner. However, this does not change fundamental facts of human nature and human behavior. Think about it for a second. People who are insulting can be insulting in one of two ways, purposefully and inadvertently. Let’s look at inadvertently first. 

Imagine that someone, an African-American woman, is offended by a middle aged coworker who uses some horrifically outdated and tone deaf but ultimately innocuous phrase like, “forshizzle”. Yuck.

And this is infuriating. I get that. But what is the proper way to deal with this? To shout at the coworker? To berate and belittle them? What will that achieve? Most like fear and resentment about being publicly embarrassed about something that they did not intend to mean as offensive. That does not mean that we should let the offending coworker off the hook. But it does mean that we should be careful with our tone. Because if we don’t, we run the risk of alienating a lot of people who might otherwise be sympathetic. 

What about people who are intentionally offensive? What about racists, white supremacists, and alt-right trolls? Surely we can unleash our rage and fury on them, right? 

Wrong. And it’s not hard to understand why. Just think about it. If you are someone who finds themselves on the non-Trumpian side of American and world politics, I’m willing to bet you love watching videos of Karens throwing tantrums, or popular subreddits like r/insanepeoplefacebook or r/neckbeards or which are devoted to mocking privileged and entitled people. It’s funny to watch people lose their shit, isn’t it?

So, if you are someone deplores the rise of bigoted, intolerant, nativist politicians (like me), you’ll probably want to police your tone and the tone of your ostensible allies a bit *more*, rather than less. Throwing a tantrum, calling names, losing your cool is playing directly into the hands of your opponents. You are making yourself look ridiculous when you do that. You are making yourself look like them. 

But, one might say, it’s natural and healthy to express anger and frustration. Perhaps, in personal relationships, but not really in professional settings and certainly not in political ones. We are in for a bumpy decade and the last thing we need is to act as though losing one’s cool is a righteous political expression. Let’s work more on being measured, calm and ruthless in the pursuit of our goals. Contrapoints has a great video about this. [Check it out. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuN6GfUix7c) And change my view. I would love to hear from people who think that tone policing is a bad idea.</original_post>

    <text>I am a male. I am 6’4. I’ve been told that I’m fairly attractive. Good bone structure or whatever. I’m white passing, though I’m mixed race, none of this was a choice. I dress relatively well put together, so I may appear “privileged”, but I am far from it. I grew up on Gratiot and 6 Mile in Detroit. Look it up if you want, suffice it to say, it was not a privileged upbringing. 


I also happen to be autistic, and inadvertently come across as condescending, frequently. 


Should I carry around a detailed, vetted card giving me a pass to accidentally be a bit of a dick sometimes? 


The point is, intent is key, and as you pointed out, so is culture, and apparently sex. How do we determine intent with tone, accurately?</text>

    <text>I think you may have misconstrued the point of my post.  

What I'm trying to say (I'm a bit long winded) is that we should remain levelheaded when disagreeing with people.  Regardless of who we are.  Don't you agree?</text>

    <text>&amp;gt;I just love this question. I love everyone's insightful responses on this thread. I had someone call my opinions screwed up (they used much worse language) simply because I was pointing out a possible different angle to something they shared and deemed discriminatory. I just presented another side, kindly, and was basically called a bigot. I was, in my eyes, tone policed because I did not agree with their tone (if tone means argument). You see, we should start with what tone means. Anyway....I told this person basically dude, you should know me and my intent. You are attacking my character instead of my argument. Majorly unproductive.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;so no... /u/DetroitUberDriver ...I don't think we should have to carry around ID cards on where we stand on these issues because we should have to TALK, and figure out each others stance. To sit and figure out intention and be patient with different forms of communication and backgrounds. But this is exactly what this picky self-centered oppression olympics is doing to this generation (the opposite of making us more tolerant). We're just in competition to be more right, more hurt and more virtuous and it's so sickening. We're not listening.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;How refreshing it is just to hear these opinions....all said with clearly positive intent. You see, we don't do that enough.</text>
