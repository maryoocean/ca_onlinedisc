    <title>CMV: Making students use “at least _ book sources” in school for assignments is stupid.</title>
    <original_poster>wervousnreck</original_poster>
    <original_post>In high school we’re often told “for this paper you need five sources, and at least two must be books.” 


This is stupid because:


Books are not inherently more accurate than the internet. In fact, I’d say they’re often less accurate. They don’t always age well. School libraries are also far, far more limited than the internet. It’s ridiculous that I have to consult a 1993 “Concerned Parent’s Guide To Teen Drug Use” glossy picture book (I’m making this specific one up) as equal to peer-reviewed papers by tenured professors of their fields, just because it’s all the library has.



It’s not very hard to check out a book, so I don’t think our library skills will deteriorate as a result of doing all of our research online. Sometimes I think consulting a book can be valuable, like if you have a very large university/public library at your disposal, but even then, I don’t think much can’t be found online. I’ve cited books by pulling what I need from a Google books sample. 



It’s not as if we’re given enough time on these papers to actually read the damn things, either. Picking at random some quote from a low-quality book is vastly inferior to reading a variety of internet articles. 


On a related note, Wikipedia &amp;gt;&amp;gt; the short “topic series” books on library shelves written at one author’s indulgence. And that’s a cheap example, but honestly, Wikipedia &amp;gt;&amp;gt; most other sources below a certain length/depth.</original_post>

Books from reputable publishers are. Most libraries curates those resources, and most internet sources (that aren't journal articles) cite books and articles anyway.

Make the time, and learn how to read more efficiently. When I ask that students cite from books they are usually books I have assigned for them to read. Therefore, as final arbiter of what is a valid source, I have removed all doubt in the case of those books.

Generally, students whose papers rely on online sources have worse papers and worse grades. I've seen this across many hundreds of papers, and I don't accept internet sources any longer for that reason. 

Added to this, undergraduates are typically incapable of determining which internet sources are legitimate and which ones are full of crap.</text>
