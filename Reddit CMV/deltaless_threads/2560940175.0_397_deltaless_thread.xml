    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

This is only true if you're from the US. There's tons of other countries that call the US the US or  United States and not America. In my travels FWIW I'd say the only thing wrong with US citizens calling themselves Americans is that to a degree it doesn't really define what country you're from. Sure if you're an average looking white guy then saying you're American might default people to thinking you're from the US but for other saying you're American could mean you're from any country in Central, North or South American based on your appearance.</text>
