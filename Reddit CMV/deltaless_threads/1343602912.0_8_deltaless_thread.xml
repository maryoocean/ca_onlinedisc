    <title>CMV: The recent Atlantic shootings was not an anti-Asian event.</title>
    <original_poster>MacV_writes</original_poster>
    <original_post>A white man shot six Asian women along with two others in Atlanta. The narrative that has been that this is directly caused by anti-Asian sentiment driven by racist white supremacists stoking bigotry against Asians. To solve this problem, America must truly commit to not being racist, to listen to those in the Asian community, and to teach young white men in particular the privilege they have as well as the deadly effects of toxic masculinity. 

However, there are details that do not fit the narrative. 

A. The shooter said that this was not racially motivated. 

B. The shooter killed a white woman and white man. 

C. While the shooter had shared a post critical of China https://twitter.com/yellokeith/status/1372202427584192513?s=09 it never rose beyond the national condemnation -- and the victims were Korean.

D. White nationalists in particular are well known for their love of Asian peoples and Asian culture, due to their valuation of ethnostates. 

E. Intentionally racist shootings usually come with racist manifestos, shamelessly racist worldviews, racist narratives about how white people are facing oppression. 

F. The #1 systemic discrimination Asian people face is from Progressives championing 'meritocracy is racist' and 'Asians are white-adjacent' inflammatory racial rhetoric, resulting in concrete discriminatory politics targeting Asian people specifically by their race. https://www.newsweek.com/asian-americans-emerging-strong-voice-against-critical-race-theory-opinion-1574503 

G. Criticism of China as a global, hegemonic, communist power is mainstream and not founded on race or xenophobia. 

It is my view Progressivism is a system which converts Trauma into capital. It seems as though these current narratives are forcing an anti-Asian narrative as a politically motivated strategy to appeal to build on this system. People like Trevor Noah believe killing six Asian people necessarily is a racist attack. But that strikes me as intentionally crude analysis. Isn't it racist for us to project all Asians onto China? Aren't we racistly manipulating the narrative when we selectively emphasize race to push politics, especially when said politics advocates for formally discriminating against Asians as "white-adjacent?"</original_post>

    <text>“A. The shooter said that this was not racially motivated.”

They literally just killed 8 people. Are we seriously going to take his word? This would be like OJ saying, “I’m innocent”

“B. The shooter killed a white woman and a white man.”

And? That alone doesn’t prove anything. The shooter very well still could’ve targeted Asians but the 2 white people happened to be fodder. 

“C. And the victims were Korean.” 

Often times, when someone is racist, and this is especially prevalent for Asians, is that said person has a hard time distinguishing between different cultures. All they see is “Asian”, without caring about whether they are Chinese, Korean, etc...

“D. White nationalists in particular are well known for their love of Asian peoples and Asian culture, due to their valuation of ethnostates.”

This main problem with this argument is that you are trying to apply a generality to a specific event. Even if you’re generality is true (I would beg to differ but not that point right now), we still have to look at this particular event and the mindset of this particular shooter.

“E. Intentionally racist shootings usually come with racist manifestos, shamelessly racist world views, racist narratives about how white people are facing oppression.”

Again, the main problem with this argument is that you’re trying to apply a generality to make a conclusion about this particular case. This would be like saying in court, “Your honor my client is innocent because the victim died by knife, even though most murder victims die by gunshot wound”.

F- this just feels like a deflection to be honest, and again, doesn’t prove or disprove the motivation behind this particular shooter. 

“G. Criticism of China as a global, hegemonic, communist power is mainstream and not founded on race or xenophobia.”

Yes, calling out a particular government isn’t racist or xenophobic, but attacking Americans of Chinese descent is. In case you’re unaware, this shooting isn’t a stand-alone incident of Asian-Americans being targeted.</text>

Usually racists take the opportunity to spread the racist word. It's a solid counterpoint.

&amp;gt;And? That alone doesn’t prove anything. The shooter very well still could’ve targeted Asians but the 2 white people happened to be fodder.

And it's another solid counterpoint. White supremacists want to preserve the master white race, obviously. 

&amp;gt;Often times, when someone is racist, and this is especially prevalent for Asians, is that said person has a hard time distinguishing between different cultures. All they see is “Asian”, without caring about whether they are Chinese, Korean, etc...

Right. But you would expect if this was seriously motivated by China in particular, he would target, you know, Chinese.. he'd go to China Town. It's not that hard. So it lends credibility that it was about the sex work.

&amp;gt;This main problem with this argument is that you are trying to apply a generality to a specific event. Even if you’re generality is true (I would beg to differ but not that point right now), we still have to look at this particular event and the mindset of this particular shooter.

The idea is the culture of the extreme right lead to this. But theres serious incoherency with the theory. If anything, the right wing seems fairly positive on Asians. They hate Black people, gays, and Jews.

&amp;gt;Again, the main problem with this argument is that you’re trying to apply a generality to make a conclusion about this particular case. This would be like saying in court, “Your honor my client is innocent because the victim died by knife, even though most murder victims die by gunshot wound”.

No, we're speculating on motivation. The motivation of racist shootings, especially intentional racist shootings, is getting the racist word out. If you're going to go out with a bang, so to speak, you might as well plant the seeds of hate .. you are concretizing a projected motivation with your analogy.

&amp;gt;this just feels like a deflection to be honest, and again, doesn’t prove or disprove the motivation behind this particular shooter.

It's the most serious discrimination Asians experience. I mean that's an actual Chinese-American advocacy group saying how CRT paints a target on Asian peoples back. The current anti-Asian narrative props up those discriminatory politics.

&amp;gt;Yes, calling out a particular government isn’t racist or xenophobic, but attacking Americans of Chinese descent is. In case you’re unaware, this shooting isn’t a stand-alone incident of Asian-Americans being targeted.

Obviously, using this event to say oh well we can't criticize the superpower America competes with because it leads white people to kill Asians .. is sus.</text>
