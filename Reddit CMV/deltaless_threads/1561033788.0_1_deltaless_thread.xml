    <title>CMV: Pregnant women should be automatically registered to donate their afterbirths for stem cell research (with an opt-out option).</title>
    <original_poster>Ragdoll_Proletariat</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm a Catholic and my father received stem cell treatment a few years ago. It massively improved his quality of life. I learned shortly beforehand that a woman's afterbirth and its core blood contains a lot of stem cells which can be used, to the point that women can actually donate them. I think this should be made an automatic process because of the following reasons:

1. There's no religious debate about harming an embryo because the baby has already been born, meaning that Christian women could help move this forward.
2. Afterbirths normally go in the bin which is a waste of stem cells.
3. Most women don't know this is an option so wouldn't opt into it.

I believe this would hasten research opportunities and consequently medical developments.

I write this with the caveat that women who want to eat it/frame it/etc can opt out in the same way as with UK organ donation. I'm not a doctor of course so I'm wondering if there's anything I'm missing here. I'm interested in seeing people's thoughts on this.</original_post>

    <text>Why not just ask them for a yes or a no at some point? It's not like the kind of organ donation where you can't ask the person because they're dead. 

What you're describing almost sounds like the intent is being intentionally secretive to an extent.</text>

    <text>My thoughts were primarily that it's probably not something a pregnant woman is going to think about during labour, which under the current donation system it does seem to require quite a bit of prep on the new mother's part. Arranging it beforehand and having a quick conversation of, "By the way, this is going to research and not the bin if you don't want it," would allow them to contribute without having to prep for it.</text>

Why not, "by the way, you have the option of donating to stem cell research if you'd consent to that, is that something you'd want to do?"

I really do see a substantive difference between it going in the bin and it being used for other purposes. 

People should know about the value they're producing so that they're fully able to advocate for themselves. History is full of examples of people being kept in the dark when it comes to the proceeds of their bodies. I'm not saying you're suggesting it be totally hidden from them, but it seems like you'd rather it almost go unnoticed in order to maximize the amount of donations. Why not just ask them?</text>
