    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>There are groups of people who have never encountered a cop that wasn't corrupt or didn't feel like police were not abusing their authority. 

But that's not really the point.

Obviously not all police officers are bad people. But the institution of law enforcement has allowed for a oversight Gap leading to massive abuses of power.

And the culture War between left and right has come to a point where if you try to address any of the institutional problems with law enforcement you're "Woke"

The simple fact of the matter is the way law enforcement is handled today allows for unnecessary escalations into excessive use Force, and infringement of citizens rights, that are mostly overseen internally by the police themselves, instead of by a third party civilian oversight committee.

you're right not all cops are bastards but the system does allow for more bastards than there should be.</text>
