    <title>CMV: People forgo their right to complain if they never do anything about it</title>
    <original_poster>ooselfie</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have a few friends that complain about their life ALL the time. I hear things like:

"My job sucks, I'm miserable here"

"God school sucks, I'm studying something so uninteresting"

I think they have total control - it comes down to laziness, or perhaps they don't even really want anything to happen. It is so easy to put in some extra effort in your day to make things happen for yourself. They complain and complain but never do anything to change. It's like the boy who cried wolf. 

If you constantly complain, but do nothing to mend the problem, then you shouldn't be allowed to complain.

    <text>I post a thread on CMV to discuss it further because I'm open minded about this perspective.

I offer help in many forms (resume help, job search, counseling) to my friends and other forums all the time who do vent and complain to me, etc. </text>

    <text>Do you believe that if someone complains to you about not liking their job, there is a chance they are also looking for a discussion?</text>
