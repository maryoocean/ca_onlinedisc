    <title>CMV: Web 3.0 is just a Zoomer's realization that "Punk" was a subculture that existed before they did.</title>

    <original_post>All Web 3.0 is a call to decentralize the digital ecosystems that were built in Web 2.0. Instead of using Google and Facebook, users will create their own digital ecosystems. Hmm sounds a lot like the punk subculture that rejected postmodernism and consumerism in the 80s and 90s. 

Don't buy CD's. Make your own vinyl records! Don't buy music. Make your own music! Don't buy food. Grow your own food! I swear, Bill Maher is right when he accuses Zoomers of being the generation that thinks nobody ever lived before they did. 

Web 3.0 is just catchy nonsense that explains how YOU CAN TOO build your own digital ecosystem away from the prying eyes and centralized control of BIG TECH. Well, sure, you could do that. IF you were a programmer that was so inclined AND had a lot of disposal income to build your own digital ecosystems. There's a reason why Google and Facebook exist and most people use them: because they can't or don't want to create their own products all the time. 

Web 3.0 just seems to be a scammy premise that promises that people can "decentralize" the internet and own their own data and blah blah blah. That's not how it works. You're never going to "own" your personal data unless you essentially become a digital version of an Amish person who never uses the internet unless it's in their own homemade ecosystem. 

Also, as more and more actors move into the space to create their own ecosystems disconnected from "big tech", there will be a power law distribution on who consolidates power and influence with those new ecosystems. In effect, you're trading Google or Facebook for another 3rd party...a 3rd party which will STILL have centralized control over your data and use of their system as a customer. And no, blockchain (which is just a lame version of SQL) isn't going to solve for this. There will always be a party that acts as a controller for the data and systems that make up the ecosystem. Doesn't matter if it's Google, Facebook, or your whatever new Web 3.0 platform becomes the next player.

Again, this all just sounds like the Punk subculture that advocated a DIY ethos. Tell me the difference between the punk subculture and the Zoomer's wet dream of a "decentralized internet" a la "Web 3.0".

Go ahead and change my view but please spare me any lofty generalized nonsense about how Web 3.0 will cure cancer and save the whales.</original_post>

    <text>I do not think Web 3.0 is an embodiment of the punk DIY ethos.  But you know what did?  Web 1.0.  People say Blockchain is punk?  Naw son, Netscape was punk.

There are no drag and drop editors in punk rock.  Punk rock was hand-coded html.  

Punk rock did not have slick animations built on opaque software.  Punk rock was cut up words and shitty photocopies.  Like my webpage in 1995.

Punk rock did not have automated reundant distribution powered by a distributed network.  You walked your tape to the corner shop.  Or you got your buddy to sneak your page onto to the University's network.  That shit might go down any time.

Punk rock did not have openly accessible data to be indexed.  Information was tightly controlled through discrete channels.  Remember PO Boxes?  Yeah you had to type in my web address, which involved tildies.

Punk rock wasn't about global, unlimited potential for collaboration -- it was about isolation.  Unless you were in a major metropolitan area, you had small groups of like-minded people working in isolation.  Again, like the first internet collectives.

Somewhere around 25 years ago, Billy Idol said "the internet is punk rock."  And he was right.  Hopefully you can share my view.  :)</text>
