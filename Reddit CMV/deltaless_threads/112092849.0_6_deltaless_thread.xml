    <title>M23 I refuse to flirt before the first date of a serious relationship CMV</title>

    <original_post>TL;DR: Flirting assesses sexual compatibility, which alone is not sufficient to guarantee long term success, making it not a useful indicator.  Furthermore, any incompatibilities can often times be worked out with open and honest communication.  

I don't do casual dating, hookups, etc.  When I date, it's to find an entire life partner: that is what I'm looking for.  Because that's what I want, I accumulated a lot of advice on what makes a successful long term relationship, and it is a combination of compatibility, communication, and compromise, among others.  

Getting to the point: flirting is about turning each other on sexually.  In a open and honest relationship, both partners will communicate to one another their desires, and depending on that sexual compatibility, and other things, the relationship will or will not work out.  It doesn't make sense for "blind" flirting to occur, before both parties know what each other honestly wants, and then based on how lucky you are at guessing the other person's flirting strategies, succeed and win the first date.  

Problems with this approach: My guess is, women look for a spark, and I actively avoid generating it--if there is a flirt opportunity, I consciously turn it down.  The rationale being that when the time comes, I'll turn up the seduction and work it out, but that time only comes during dating, not before.  

Background: I was a child actor, so once I find out my partner's turn ons, I can play out the fantasies and characters she wants.  To me, seduction is like acting out a role.  And the compromise is if I give her a night of acting, I'll get one in return.  </original_post>

    <text>That's just compartmentalization. You're slicing up aspects of what would otherwise be a smooth interaction of people doing what interests them by attempting to deign primacy to one or more factors of human interaction. It's a very common no no if you actually want other people to get to know who you are.  
It's not like it's an important or novel distinction either. The first person to ever realize that the meeting the other person's family could be fun was making a novel distinction. Deciding not to flirt because you're trying to compartmentalize it and intellectualize it away from "who you are" is not an "approach," it's unnecessary and frankly a little creepy. </text>

    <text>You remind me of "it's not manipulation if it's not intended to be manipulation."  I guess I feel like because I can constantly simulate and guess with pretty good accuracy the outcomes of certain actions, anytime I choose the most successful action, it's somehow disingenuous or manipulative.  But I need to realize that it's only the case when I go against what my "true self" would have chosen</text>

    <text>It sounds like you're just saying you want to flirt. Does this mean you changed your view or am I missing something?</text>
