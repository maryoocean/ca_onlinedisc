    <title>CMV a society run via a libertarian meritocracy has the same outcome as a strict class (or caste) system.</title>

    <original_post>For the purposes of this question, I define libertarian meritocracy as one where the government has almost 0 effect on day to day life, and people advance in society purely on the strength of their own skill or luck.

I believe this has the effect of creating and reinforcing a class system because of the fundamental inequality of birth. A poor person born into this society would have few chances for learning and advancement of their skills, while a rich person would have access to high quality teachers and resources that would help them get ahead.

After several generations, you would have rich families far more power and influence than any poor family, and they could easily conspire to keep it that way via nepotism and corruption. 

Once societal mobility is taken away, there's nothing effectively different about this society and strictly class based society.</original_post>

    <text>Intergenerational wealth correlations are not anywhere near strong enough to make this theory work.

The [correlation](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/378526?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) is 0.4.

Another way of putting is that 16% of difference in wealth outcomes come from difference in parental wealth. The variance of other 84% from person to person is going to dwarf the 16%.

 You see when you look at tables of how well rich kids do.[ Someone who is borne in the top 20% of the country only have a 40% chance to stay in the top 20% of the country.](http://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/~/media/images/reports/2013/07/cpi%20dp12/piinternationalmobilitychart1600.jpg) That is higher then average, but it is no way to maintain a caste system.

Another way of putting it is that fucking up is really easy. Around half of the kids who starts off rich will still screw it up. And over any non-trivial timespan, this will produce enough churn to destroy your caste system.</text>

    <text>This basically rips my theory to shreds, but I have to ask: how much of that is caused by our current society? With taxes on inheritance and regulations that keep companies competitive? In a libertarian society, nothing is keeping the rich from stacking the deck wildly in their favor...</text>
