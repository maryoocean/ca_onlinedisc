    <title>CMV: women are not going for the 'upper tier' of men</title>
    <original_poster>BadgerSame6600</original_poster>
    <original_post>I see this rhetoric over and over and over online, and hear it IRL sometimes.  It drives me crazy tbh. I am a man out in the world, living life, 35 years of it now. I have friends who are all over the spectrum of physical attractiveness. Some are single, most aren't. Their gfs/wifes are also across the spectrum. In most couples I know, friends and acquaintances,  the woman is better looking, earns more, or has more social skills ect. 

Now I know this is my experience, so it is anecdotal, but at the same time I just don't buy this whole women are too choosy. My opinion is that the dudes who say this are refusing to address their flaws and accept them. If these men believe this and they go out into the world feeling hard done by, fighting a losing battle, then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Most people can smell that level of victimhood a mile of. 

OK, open to have this challenge, so- change my view, Redditors! </original_post>

    <text>Many women on dating apps or seeking casual sex are doing that. Doesn’t speak to all relationships of course, and there are plenty of exceptions</text>

    <text>Except even that is not true.

Dating apps see men take the initiative and women being far more reactive. Men typically initiate, and women respond.

As a result, the group of men that a woman choses from is determined by the men that chose her, and since they aim upwards (everyone does) on average she will be reaching down. Not a lot, but some.</text>

    <text>Yes, many many men initiate to even a single woman and she has dozens to choose from, where as the inverse never ever happens. This leads to a natural situation of being choosy....</text>

    <text>Sure, and the men aimed upwards.

To be so gauche as to put numbers on it. A six can be a choosey if she wants, if she's picking from a collection of fives that won't matter a thing.</text>

    <text>but women don’t usually only get approached by men who are below them, most women can be picky and still have a ton of really good options while men cant even get half a small amount of women who are below them to want them  so they can choose</text>

    <text>What do you mean "inverse never ever happens".

It sure does if you're a very good looking guy. Most guys never experience it.</text>
