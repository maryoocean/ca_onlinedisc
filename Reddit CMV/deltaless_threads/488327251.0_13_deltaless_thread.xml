    <title>CMV:I see no real reason to avoid resurrecting an extinct animal through cloning, and believe that fears of consequences are wildly overblown.</title>

    <original_post>Jurassic Park, while a wildly entertaining movie, did a disservice to the public by planting irrational fears in the mind of the general public. 

While there is little chance of resurrecting a T-Rex or other dinosaur, we may be only a few years away from seeing a mammoth or saber-tooth walking the Earth again.  

Many people fear this and some are even actively working to prevent this from ever happening.

Some people argue that the introduction of foreign animals into an ecosystem would do much more damage than good. 

Less common but incredibly vocal are the people that see such experiments as an affront to God or Nature. 

Other people say that funds wasted on resurrecting an extinct animal could be better spent on conserving living animals.

I for one would be overjoyed to see news of living woolly mammoth walking the Earth again.  I also believe such an announcement would result in massive funding influx from private sources that could result even more scientific advances. These advances could have benefits for humans far beyond what we can imagine. 

A perfect example of such unforeseen advances are the many benefits brought about by the Space Race.  There are far too many to list here, but [Wikipedia lists perhaps over a hundred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_spinoff_technologies). I fully believe such spinoffs in biology would greatly benefit mankind.

    <text>Jurassic Park was more of a social criticism levelled at industry for focusing on narrow technical problems to the exclusion of the broader picture.

In the book, the problem that Ian Malcolm had with Jurassic park was that the park was a rigid, unstable system. Hammond's engineers implemented clever safeguards to be sure, but they failed to predict that the dinosaurs would gain the ability to reproduce, or that the electric fences would go down.

Malcolm's point was that the dinosaurs were adaptable and the park would inevitably have security flaws due to some oversight or other, and this combination would ultimately cause the park to collapse catastrophically.

The lesson isn't so much that pushing technological boundaries is evil. It's about appreciating the limits of our power to comprehend complex systems which will behave in ways that surprise us and catch us off guard.
