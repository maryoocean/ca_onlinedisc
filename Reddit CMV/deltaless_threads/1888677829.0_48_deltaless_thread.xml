    <title>CMV: It's stupid to care about the environment in space.</title>
    <original_poster>MostRecommendation84</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm a big proponent of space colonization/exploitation and every time I bring it up there's someone who says something along the lines of "Oh we're gonna trash the Moon like we did Earth?" "Oh good more mining!" "Humanity won't rest until we've exploited everything we can!" and other snide comments to that effect. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Honestly, it just sounds like the dumbest argument to me and I wouldn't even be bothering with a CMV if I hadn't heard it so many times. *It's rocks. Uninhabitable barren rocks floating through vast chunks of literally* ***nothing****.* There's no space squirrels to worry about, we haven't found any aliens and we really have no reason to assume any are out there, let alone that they give a shit what we do to Mercury. Furthermore, you want to stop desertification or the human rights violations of cobalt mining, you're gonna be hard pressed to find a better solution than the absurd volumes of water and cobalt from here to the asteroid belt.</original_post>

    <text>Its tangential to your point but consider this:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Every organisation capable of mining asteroids (which would by far be the biggest space industry) is by definition capable of moving said asteroids, and thus, capable of easily causing an C-T-Class Planetary Extinction Event if they accidentally (or on purpose!) drop a Mt Everest-sized rock on Earth.  


SO its not the risk of humans littering all over the void of space, but humans accidentally throwing space litter (like say, a *tiny,* barely 20 km rock) on Earth and causing rather substantial property damage. Imagine the lawsuits!</text>
