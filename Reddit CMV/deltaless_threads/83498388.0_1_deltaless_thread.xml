    <title>I believe that the death sentence should be automatic after a second serious offense and first time offenders should spend almost all of their sentence being educated. CMV.</title>

    <text>What is a serious offense?
If you do not think that 1 burglary is worth a death sentence, why should two?
How will you prevent the problem of innocent people being convicted?
How do you prevent class justice, i.e. a policeman or judge gets off with a warning but a black teen gets the book thrown at him?

Death sentences are irreversible, so in order to be acceptable, you better solve these other problems first - unless your goal is not justice but only to get rid of poor and minorities</text>

    <text>The more serious offenses would be those relating to murder, assault in the first degree, and the cases relating to them. 
The reason I said on the second offense is to give a chance at rehabilitation. 
I didn't want to make a whole paragraph for this but I do understand that you would also have to change the way that people are being convicted. I've always felt that a  union of countries (Let's say something like U.S. and Canada) could work to make a truly blind justice system. Having picked someone that has absolutely no relation to the case would help with the corruption that it usually brings.
