    <title>CMV: Equastrian sports should not be part of the Olympics.</title>
    <original_poster>LarryAndBarry</original_poster>
    <original_post>The Olympics in my opinion, is to challenge the boundaries of a humans physical abilities and see who is the best of the best. Its amazing what the human body is capable of when pushed to it limits.

I understand the same level of commitment goes into being a horse rider, but I feel as though equastrian sports is more a test for the horses. In theory, a javelin thrower can use any type of javelin but still throw a winning shot, but a rider can't really do the same with which horse he/she will use, therefore relying heavily on the horses ability to perform as well as their own. In the same vein, why not include the traditional horse racing with jockeys into the Olympics. </original_post>

    <text>Equestrian events have been part of the Olympics [since 680 BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariot_racing). There are even legends dating back to antiquity that (albeit incorrectly) identify chariot racing as the first Olympic event, the event for which the Olympics was founded. So say that such an archetypal event is not representative of the Olympics seems incorrect. </text>
