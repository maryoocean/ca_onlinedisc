    <title>CMV: Euthanasia should be legal in all jurisdictions to be performed on humans.</title>
    <original_poster>SirenitoDelFrio</original_poster>
    <original_post>Euthanasia is the practice of painlessly killing someone due to terminal illness or extreme pain. If this is allowed to be performed on animals, then why are humans any different?

Since this is a messy political and ethical question, I’ll try to state my side of the problem only.

-

When a person is suffering, either do to cancer, life threatening injuries, a vegetative state, or any other factor that reduces their quality of life to nearly nothing, I whole heartedly believe that the execution of euthanasia should be allowed legally.

What joy from life does a person get if they are trapped in a hospital bed, with no chance of getting better? If they have no hope of living their life, then why should we continue to force their hearts to beat via machines? All the machines do is keep the heart beating, and drain the families bank accounts. They don’t keep the brain active, they don’t allow for communication. It’s simply a way for a hospital to earn money from a grieving family.

What is ethical about forcing someone to keep living, when they don’t receive the actual benefits of life? I just don’t see the moral responsibility of keeping someone alive when they receive no quality of life. I don’t get why someone should be kept alive if they have no chance of getting better.</original_post>

    <text>Or maybe it will never happen for in the US it’s a state issue not a Federal issue.  The closest it will go toward the Feds is through Death Panels in Obama Care when they choose if a persons life is worth the price the healthcare would cost for the expected social value.  But still not Federal granted Euthanasia.

Yes, I have first hand experience with the aging population and Alzheimers, for I took care of my mother for two years personally who had Alzheimer’s and dementia, at home till she passed.  Everyday was a gift.  Some days were hard gifts and some soft, but everyday was a gift.</text>
