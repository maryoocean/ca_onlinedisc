    <title>CMV: Giving other cultures sh*t about eating dog meat is hypocritical</title>
    <original_poster>simobk</original_poster>
    <original_post>Hi all,

So someone just posted a video on my FB feed about [the Yulin dog meat festival](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=yulin+dog+meat+festival). It is horrifying...

For the purpose of this CMV, let's forget about how it's done (the way they get the dogs, they treat them... etc.) and concentrate **only** on the dog meat eating part.

I love dogs, and yes, I find it horrifying that other cultures eat them. However, I also understand that for other cultures, it is horrifying to see us eat beef or pork.

In my opinion, the only situation where you are allowed to complain is if you are talking about eating animal meat in general. But if you enjoy eating a good steak, then it is hypocritical to criticize others for eating what they consider is "just meat".

Again, I am stressing the fact that this is not about the *animal cruelty* part. It's just about the meat eating. For the sake of this CMV, let's suppose that the animals are bred and slaughtered in the most humane possible way.

So... CMV

    <text>Okay, I'm not directly trying to change your view OP as I think it is quite a reasonable stand. However I think it's too much of an exception to not consider the presiding matters of the festival. I'll just list them out and you can assess for yourself whether they should have a mitigating factor in people's outrage.

1) The Yulin government has backtracked on its word following their distancing of the festival last year. Even though there has been sort of a ban on the public slaughter of dogs, with Yulin being a poor and rural region, it's quite difficult to enforce. It's important to note that dog isn't really considered a mainstream delicacy in China anymore and the rest of China is just as pissed at Yulin.

2) It wouldn't be as horrific, if they didn't make it an *annual celebration*. It sucks that animals must suffer and die to satiate human appetites especially man's best friend. There are still many countries in the world that eat dog, but don't achieve this level of outrage because they don't rub it in the faces of the anti-dog meat campaign by throwing a huge festival where they must slaughter thousands of dogs.

3) No matter how much you try and disprove it, dogs are different from the livestock which we source our meat from. Etymologically, they serve a purpose of companionship and in older times have even served as hunting partners. Nowadays they have been domesticated and become very tame and affectionate towards humans. It's probably why they are also affectionately called man's best friend. They aren't readily bred for meat and it would be in poor taste to eat them. Mandatory [image](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/78/78be62f68a84116500dd40052c820fbed5ab2831658d6cd3c0836c110d35a88c.jpg) that probably sums up this point.

4) There have been many reports that some of the dog meat sourced during the Yulin festival aren't at all from dog farms. Literally, some dog hustlers are just snatching up strays and stealing pets from other people. Aside from the ethical problems this may have with the complete disregard for our pets, this also raises some serious health concerns. Dogs aren't cultured and bred to the same health standards of livestock and they aren't exactly known to be the cleanest animals in the world. With small, cramped cages in close proximity to one another, this is a significant health risk that warrants attention on its own.

So yea, food for thought. Just not dog for me.</text>
