I think homeless spikes should be removed. I believe you will always have rough sleepers (although we could probably drastically reduce the amount in the UK) and as such should not introduce such measures.

I just donâ€™t get the justification.

EDIT: Anybody who wants can sleep in my garden, or outside my house. If I didn't live with someone else who'd be worried about getting his stuff pinched I'd let anybody who asked sleep in my house, although I wouldn't let them have my room n I'd keep the door locked. There is very little to steal that I own.

I've never owned a car, never will, I just cannot justify it morally because of the environmental damage they cause. If I did own one I would let people sleep in it.

I do see a massive difference between putting spikes in what is a pubic place (regardless of who 'owns' it) and not letting homeless people sleep in your house though. I think it's moot.

    <text>I agree that these spikes should never be installed, but for different reasons. I think it is a crazy measure in that it poses an obvious safety hazard (what if someone slips and falls?) and is a waste of useful space. Put a bike rack there instead or something.

However, that rough sleepers will always exist is *not* a good reason. Society has programs to accommodate homeless people, and it is not for nothing that we try to get people off the streets.</text>
