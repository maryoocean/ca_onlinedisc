    <title>People should not break up fights unless one of the fighters explicitly states that they don't want to be fighting. CMV</title>

    <original_post>This has always been a major peeve of mine. I like watching random people fight, and I've been in a few myself. Every time there's a fight, some asshole decides to be a hero and try to break it up. Back in high school, these two kids pulled us apart even though we both explicitly stated that we wanted to fight. Now, I understand why a teacher, cop, or bouncer would do it, nothing against them, but if you're not an authority figure or at risk of injury or property damage yourself, you should let the people fight. For example, if you form a fight ring in high school around the two combatants, then no one is getting hurt, and nor is anyone not involved in the fight getting injured. In that case, no one should intervene unless an authority figure arrives. 

Now of course, there are exceptions. For example, if one person clearly does not want to be in the fight, then someone should break it up. For example, they may be asking for help or just being pummeled without throwing any punches themselves. Or if you witnessed the fight from the very beginning and one guy clearly just attacked the other without provocation. Then you should break up the fight. 

Otherwise, two adults should be allowed to fight and no one should intervene until one of them either states that he does not want to fight anymore, or is put into a state into which he cannot express this desire. Otherwise, people should just enjoy the show and mind their own fucking business.

    <text>Fighting in public always carries the risk of injuring a non-combatant or destroying a non-combatant's property.  In other words, if I'm in the vicinity of a fight, I'm at risk of being injured or having my property destroyed.  So even by the parameters that you have defined, I am within my rights to break up a fight that I see if I am able.

Even if those who wish to watch the fight form a circle around the combatants to minimize the risk to others now all they've done is create a massive disturbance in this public place.  Why is that fair to everyone who is trying to enjoy their day and go about their business peacefully?

Is it really so hard to find a venue for your mindless violence where you know you wont be disturbed?  I would go on to question the wisdom in solving any dispute with violence but I think your mind is made up in that regard.</text>
