    <title>CMV:Germany could not win WW2</title>
    <original_poster>Niberus</original_poster>
    <original_post>I’ve often heard that if Germany did something different one way or another then they could have won WW2 however, I'd argue that they had no chance to win no matter what they would have done (a realistic way that is). 

From attacking the French and English in the west, to trying to subjugate various countries in the Balkans to having the brilliant idea of invading the Soviet Union, the Germans just kept making the war harder for themselves whilst making their goals further and further unreachable as the war staggered on and they were eventually chased all the way back to Berlin.

Not exactly sure what was going through Hitler’s brain at the time or when he ended his life in the Fuhrer bunker though I have to imagine that whatever mistakes he might have wanted to avoid at various points of the war it would still have ended terribly for them.

From the Allies having the control of most of the world’s resources, to the Soviet Union being too big of a block to try and knock down, to the unstable and unreliable allies that Germany had on its side, to the ideological zeal that prevented many alliances that could have taken place simply vanishing into the wind, to the massive industrial output being underestimated by the axis, to the poor planning of certain plans, to the various manpower issues that Germany suffered from, to the poor prioritization in subjecting various “””subhuman””” (their words not mine) cultures or deficiencies of human beings rather than building more war material.

Another issue is that time was simply not on Germany’s side due to all the continuing escalations that were occurring from the Japanese and Italians that various other powers were going to be fighting Germany regardless thereby tipping the scales even if the Germans wanted to keep the war on a small scale. While I won’t say that the Americans or Soviets would inevitably join if the Germans decided to draw the war out, it certainly didn’t look positive for them either. Secondly the British simply wouldn’t have fallen or settled for a white peace as they had the industry and manpower to fight on and had a superior air force to begin bombing Germany itself during nighttime. The Soviets had the manpower and industry to fight on and a massive distance between the German army and the relocated industry in the Urals. And the Americans? Well they had so much that they could sustain a war on two front against two major enemies that Germany itself could only have dreamed of either from the First World War or from the Second World War that they ended up losing anyway.

With all of this in mind, I just do not see a (rational and realistic) way in which the Germans could win. Everything was against them from the very beginning in the invasion of the Second Polish Republic to the scorching deserts of North Africa, to the hellscape of Far Eastern Europe to the collapse of the Reich itself. 

Would be welcome to changing my mind…</original_post>

    <text>It becomes an issue of where you draw the line at which we move into hypothetical history, and how far it can differ from what actually happened. With the power of hindsight, it's not really all that difficult to look back and pick series of plausible events that didn't happen, but could've, and then speculate about events from there. 

For example, what if instead of Hitler coming to power, some politically savvy civic nationalist, let's call him schmittler, creates a party and achieves power at around the same time Hitler would've, and firmly crushes the nazi party in the early 30s. He carries many of the same ideas under his party, that the German people deserve better, and that Germany needs to secure what the allies unfairly denied it after the first world War.

He then follows this with a similar remilitarization to real-world Germany, forming a tenuous alliance with the soviets in order to secure crucial resources like oil. But unlike the real world, Herr schmittler sees no purpose in an alliance with imperial Japan. After all, they're on opposite sides of the Asian continent and offer very little in actual support.

Come the late 30s, Germany officially annexes Austria, marking their first expansion, which is quickly followed by the takeover of czechoslovakia, and the invasion of Poland along with the soviets. Come 1940, Germany launches their blitzkrieg into France, swiftly taking control and forcing the British off the continent. All of this happened in reality, so it isn't difficult to imagine it also being feasible in our hypothetical.

Now, here's where our hypothetical reality truly diverges from the true reality. Being much more of a statesman, and aware of the existing struggles within Germany's newly acquired land, schmittler decides to offer an olive branch to Britain, and instead focus on properly securing and integrating their new holdings, after all, military occupation can't last forever. Instead of focusing on continued military expansion, the war efforts are shifted to propaganda. Schools are prioritized, and given significant support from the German government. Of course, these schools teach their polish/french/Czech students useful things like the German language, and a German perspective on history. Aid is provided to towns that suffered in the war, and subsidies are offered to farmers, lowering the cost of living. Politicians friendly to the German empire are promoted through shadowy networks of propaganda, both domestic and abroad.

But wait, you say, what about America? From the outset, America was formally neutral in this war, though favoring the allies. Well, with his knowledge of politics, schmittler knew America was a danger, a massive one at that. So he kept agression against America to a minimum. Unrestricted submarine warfare was kept largely off the table, with attacks focused on small amounts of known military targets. The Zimmerman telegram was never written, nor sent. So grounds were never presented for America to formally join the war. Well, come December 7, 1941, the Japanese launch a preemptive strike on the American pacific fleet at pearl harbor. 

In our reality, this gave America the justification needed to join the war, and overwhelmingly shifted the publics view in support of the allies. But in schmittler's reality, Germany has since put a halt on war efforts, and Japan is not actively in an alliance with Germany. Seeing no reason to poke the beast, Germany does not follow Japan's declaration of war on America, but instead offers support to Americaas a gesture of peace. As a result, the public opposition to Germany begins to shrink as the war in the pacific diverts American media and resources from efforts in Europe.

Having maintained their positive, albeit tense, relationships with the soviet union, and securing their holdings on the European continent, Britain has little desire to continue the war, and accepts a friendly relationship with Germany and establishes trade. America eventually secures victory over the Japanese empire, with marginal support from Germany, and also establishes friendly relationships. 

This is a solid German victory. They achieve moderate territorial expansion, they hold military superiority on the continent, becoming a world superpower, and they've shed the belittling restrictions of the treaty of Versailles. It was certainly a different war from the one we saw in our own reality, but it certainly seems within the realms of probability for a different reality where history played our differently.</text>

    <text>There are a number of historical facts which would render this scenqrio impossible. 

&amp;gt;instead of Hitler coming to power, some politically savvy civic nationalist, let's call him schmittler, creates a party and achieves power at around the same time Hitler would've, and firmly crushes the nazi party in the early 30s. He carries many of the same ideas under his party, that the German people deserve better, and that Germany needs to secure what the allies unfairly denied it after the first world War.

Schmit may be able to win the 1933 federal election, but without the terror campaign against the SPD and KPD, the left parties may be able to prevent him from passing the Enabling Act. 


&amp;gt;He then follows this with a similar remilitarization to real-world Germany, forming a tenuous alliance with the soviets in order to secure crucial resources like oil. But unlike the real world, Herr schmittler sees no purpose in an alliance with imperial Japan.

Plausible though it should be noted that the Nazis hostorically took on large amounts of debt to be able to afford remilitarization.


&amp;gt;Come the late 30s, Germany officially annexes Austria, marking their first expansion, which is quickly followed by the takeover of czechoslovakia, and the invasion of Poland along with the soviets.

These actions would have greatly alarmed the UK, even if Schmit isnt a Nazi.


&amp;gt;Come 1940, Germany launches their blitzkrieg into France, swiftly taking control and forcing the British off the continent. All of this happened in reality, so it isn't difficult to imagine it also being feasible in our hypothetical.

Historically the breakthrough in the Ardennes had a good chance of ending badly for the German panzers, but I'll let this slide.

&amp;gt;schmittler decides to offer an olive branch to Britain, and instead focus on properly securing and integrating their new holdings, after all, military occupation can't last forever.

Like Rudolph Hess historically tried to do? There is no chance that UK will accept any peace offer that establishes collaboration governments in western Europe. 

&amp;gt;Schools are prioritized, and given significant support from the German government. Of course, these schools teach their polish/french/Czech students useful things like the German language, and a German perspective on history. Aid is provided to towns that suffered in the war, and subsidies are offered to farmers, lowering the cost of living. Politicians friendly to the German empire are promoted through shadowy networks of propaganda, both domestic and abroad.

All of these things cost money, which Germany does not have. For the past 7 years their government has been taking on unsustainable amounts of debt in order to fund the war machine. Even all of that wasn't enough, historically the Nazis seized the Austrian and Czechoslovakian gold reserves. 

In any case, no government in France or Poland will be able to gain widespread support as long as it is authoritarian, and on good terms with Germany. Attempting to force schools to adopt an unpopular curriculum will likely result in partisan movements resisting collaborators across the continent. 


&amp;gt;From the outset, America was formally neutral in this war, though favoring the allies. Well, with his knowledge of politics, schmittler knew America was a danger, a massive one at that. So he kept agression against America to a minimum. Unrestricted submarine warfare was kept largely off the table, with attacks focused on small amounts of known military targets. The Zimmerman telegram was never written, nor sent.

Lmao the Zimmerman telegram was during WW1, not WW2. In any case, not conducting unrestricted submarine warfare would likely improve British morale, and increase their will to fight. This would also enable UK to divert ships and planes to the Mediterranean front. 

&amp;gt;Germany does not follow Japan's declaration of war on America, but instead offers support to Americaas a gesture of peace. As a result, the public opposition to Germany begins to shrink as the war in the pacific diverts American media and resources from efforts in Europe.

Perhaps public opposition to German military might decrease, but American aid for Britain has been going on for a year by now. See destroyer for bases deal and lend-lease act. 

&amp;gt;Having maintained their positive, albeit tense, relationships with the soviet union, and securing their holdings on the European continent, Britain has little desire to continue the war, and accepts a friendly relationship with Germany and establishes trade.

By this point in the timeline, Italy without German military support is losing decisively to the UK in the Mediterranean and North Africa. What you're essentially proposing is that Germany should switch sides as soon as it becomes clear Italy has no chance of winning. Either the Italian fascists sue for peace, or the UK-supported rebels overthrow Mussolini. Both scenarios result in Italy becoming hostile to Germany in the forseable future. 


&amp;gt;This is a solid German victory. They achieve moderate territorial expansion, they hold military superiority on the continent, becoming a world superpower, and they've shed the belittling restrictions of the treaty of Versailles.

To sum up, Germany has gained neutral, at best, relations with the UK and USA. In return, it has suffered the following drawbacks:

Hostile Italy at the southern border

Unpopular collaboration governments in western, central and northern Europe

Balkans are either aligned with UK or USSR

Strong and prosperous British Empire

Industrialized USSR with a strong military

Domestically, Schmit is hated by the fascist hardliners for going easy on the liberal west, and for not going to war with USSR, while also hated by the democrats and socialists for going to war at all.

Realistically, Germany will likely suffer economic collapse due to spending tons of money on propaganda a swell as foreign aid to european dictators. At that point, either the collaborationists will be overthrown, and/or the USSR invades and installs a puppet regime in Germany.</text>
