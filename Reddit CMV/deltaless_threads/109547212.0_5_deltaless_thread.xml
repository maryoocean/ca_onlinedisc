    <title>I believe that romantic love and friendship are little more than distractions from important issues in the world. CMV.</title>

    <original_post>We often criticize people in our society for not caring enough about important issues that impact everyone (like climate change, economic inequality, social injustice, or erosion of rights and liberties) and for caring more about meaningless distractions (such as the Kardashians, the new iPad, the PS4, and twerking). But I have trouble seeing how friendships, romantic relationships, or sex are any less of a distraction. At the end of the day, they're all things that make us “feel good” and raise our endorphin level, yet those are the same reasons people enjoy watching reality TV, playing video games, or buying crap they don't need. They make them “feel good”. They're “fun”.

People pour so much energy, time, and money into these things, especially sex and romance, and our society is obsessed with them. Look at any newspaper or magazine and there will often be entire sections dedicated solely to sex and dating. Researchers at universities spend taxpayer money to study them. You can't watch a single TV show or movie without seeing a romantic subplot, and it seems like pretty much all of popular music is based on romance and sex. I often hear the refrain “man, if only people cared as much about things that really matter as they do about the latest Call of Duty game or how many points LeBron James scored”. But I think that people spend even more time energy and money on friendship, romance, and sex, and aside from some feel-good rationalizations about how those things “give meaning to life”, I fail to see how they're any less of a distraction. Think of the amount of time and energy people spend on making friends, hanging out with friends, dating, and trying to get laid. Now imagine if half of that time and energy were spent actually trying to do something to deal with real issues that actually impact people.

Of course, sex is required for the perpetuation of the species, so it is, at some level, necessary. But most people in our society obviously don't have sex for that reason. For most people, and most of the time, sex is something done for fun, and that's what makes it no different, in my eyes, than iPads and the Kardashians.</original_post>

    <text>Joy is important - it's the reason that we try to improve the world, reduce inequality, cure illnesses, and so on.  We increase the amount of joy in people's lives by doing so.  
  
  
Relationships and friendships are a primary source of joy, and often give structure to the joy that we do feel: we experience joy we never would have felt otherwise because we are with someone else.  That's not to say that joy is exclusive to relationships, but boy are they important.  They multiple joy, introduce new joy, structure joy.
  
  
So if we forego relationships and friendships and all the joy that they bring in the name of bigger issues, then what was the point of curing these things?</text>

    <text>Yes, but people also claim to derive joy from video games and watching reality TV. Who's to say that their joy is any less valid than the joy you get from friendship or love?</text>

    <text>It's not "less valid", but it might be more important.  I said that relationships and friendships increase our opportunities for joy - that makes them quite important.
