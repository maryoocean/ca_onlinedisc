    <title>CMV: Dating is like finding a job, it isn't good to put all your eggs in one basket.</title>
    <original_poster>nerdywiththeword</original_poster>
    <original_post>To start off, dating is pretty like the job interview in a relationship. you guys are conversing to see if there is a potential fit for each other. If it is successful then there is going to be an offer for a relationship; if not then either the two is going to be friends or merely walk away and say goodbye without staying in contact.

Like job hunting, one should always be vigilant. When it comes to finding a relationship, one should focus on scheduling as many dates as possible to maximize their chances of being in a relationship. It is not wise to only stick to focusing all your attention onto one person because there is a big chance it wouldn't work out. Instead by talking to as many people as possible you are spreading your eggs in multiple basket and improving your chances at beating the numbers game.

This resonates well with job hunters since doing so many interviews (Or in this case talking to many potential people) will give you more opportunities to improve and sell yourself better down the road. I remember doing like 10 interviews before getting my first job. Each interview I improve upon one another and I feel this could be applied to dating.

Another reason not to put all your eggs in one basket is to be better mentally prepared when the date doesn't workout. You have another person to look forward to meeting so you won't feel too down.

    <text>If the job is one where ability to not constantly be running between your multiple baskets is one of the major criteria, then maybe.

Potential partners care about loyalty, they care about whether you are interested in them specifically or just out to find anyone. (even if that may be slightly unrealistic) 

And sure, dating around in early stages doesn't necessarily mean that you will be disloyal later, but it certainly doesn't imply you'll be loyal either. 

If anything, this stance on dating feels utilitarian, practical and devoid of emotion or genuine connection. And while that may be reasonable to you, it also makes a potential partner feel that you will be more inclined to 'be utilitarian and practical' if difficulties come along later, sickness, financial difficulties, stress or a romantic rough patch,  and will be trying to maximize your own gain, perhaps by breaking up or leaving, instead of being moved by sentiment and an interpersonal connection to go the extra mile, even when the partner needs you to give extra effort  and is in the sort of relationship where it can be expected from time to time.

Not saying that this is true or even fair. Just that this is the kind of thing your potential partners will be worried about. </text>

    <text>You don't, up to a certain point, but if you're asked and you lie, that's a point against you. </text>

    <text>Then just wait until they ask. What are the chances they are going to do it anyways. It is just like you don't disclose if you are doing other interviews while looking for a job.</text>

    <text>Sure, there are people who would feel betrayed if they found out later, but if you don't feel uncomfortable lying by omission, it CAN work out.
