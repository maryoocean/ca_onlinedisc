    <title>CMV: Where your born doesn't matter and country pride is pointless</title>
    <original_poster>Blank-VII</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't think I belong to a country and I think the concept is odd. I was born in the UK and have lived here all my life, but I fail to understand why people are so hard-core about being a 'proud brit' or anything. Where I was born isn't something I was able to decide for myself, and I want my life to be what I make out of it, not what it decides for me. I believe the only way to belong to a country is to find one whose culture is similar to your own tastes and opinions, and to move there. What's the point in being proud of a country I was born in if I feel no attachment to how it's run or anything else?

*you're

*View partially changed. Country pride is not pointless.

**Main view unchanged, it seems no-one can quite convince me. I've had some fantastic conversations and I'm really happy with how many of you engaged without being toxic. Stay safe y'all. Thanks so much!**</original_post>

    <text>I struggled with this as well.
I live in Quebec , Canada. Never been one to be proud of being french canadian, but i grew to appreciate being canadian.
  
And its very simple, did you do anything to make the environment a better place to live in? Even if it didnt succeed , if you tried, you should be proud. People who do that are the pnes making life better for everyone, and while no one necessarily thank you for whatever small or big thing you did, being proud is its own thanks.

You cant affect everyone. Eventually in life you realise you will interact with less than 1%of the planet and making them happy or feel like part of the group is an easy way to prevent aggression. And that is what its about, cohesion. The same way that sport teams give cohesion to a group.
  
Where youre born does matter, let me tell ya, i wouldnt be alive still had i been born in China, im too rowdy and rebellious to survive Xi Jinping.  And isnt nice that you live in a place that you can say what you think?  (I know UK has some thought police) .

  
Basically i feel you havent put yourself in the shoes of those that precede you and made the world what is through difficult, sometimes regrettable choices. Especially the UK, you guys made the west what it is. A lot of major countries have ties to the UK. USA, Canada, Australia, those are big players. And your ancestors build that, what will you bring to the UK that will make those after you gaze in wonder and awe?</text>
