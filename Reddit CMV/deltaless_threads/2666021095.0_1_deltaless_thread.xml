    <title>CMV: Francis Fukuyama's "End of History" has been proven wrong</title>
    <original_poster>Real_Carl_Ramirez</original_poster>
    <original_post>This post is partially inspired by this news story: [Bin Laden's Letter to US Stuns Young Americans: 'He Was Right'](https://www.newsweek.com/bin-laden-letter-us-stuns-young-americans-he-was-right-1844234)

Francis Fukuyama is an American political scientist who wrote of the "End of History". This concept posits that with fascism and communism defeated, humanity will now gravitate towards a gradual universal adoption of capitalist liberal democracy. Fukuyama also claimed that the "End of History" will reduce conflicts between nations as the people concern themselves less with ideology and national identity, as increasing economic prosperity becomes the main concern and smooths over other concerns. Thanks to recent history, I think that such a concept is now laughable:

* Regarding the news story about young Americans agreeing with Bin Laden, this goes to show that even within capitalist liberal democracies, this model is being undermined inconvenient truths, which are further spread by social media and influencers.
   * There is a lot of dirt to be dug up about capitalist liberal democracies (e.g. regime change operations, war crimes, atrocities against indigenous peoples). With the advent of the internet, these inconvenient truths are easier to find and therefore further weaken our nations through distrust, while more authoritarian countries can keep their dirt under wraps.
   * I'm not against truth and freedom of information, I'm just pointing out that the model that Fukuyama believed would triumph is actually quite fragile and easy to undermine.
* [Democratic backsliding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_backsliding) is occurring in many countries across the world, vastly overshadowing any progress in democratisation:
   * See [this report from 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20210914030243/https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/74/8c/748c68ad-f224-4cd7-87f9-8794add5c60f/dr_2021_updated.pdf) or [this report from 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20230314164628/https://bti-project.org/en/reports/global-dashboard?&amp;cb=00000).
   * There seems to be a perverse incentive to democratic backsliding, as increasing autocracy appears to be advantageous to leaders who intend to govern like a Paradox Interactive grand strategy game (i.e. to make their country even more powerful on the world stage).
   * Additionally, [multiple countries are experiencing a double whammy of democratic backsliding and political polarisation](https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/01/18/what-happens-when-democracies-become-perniciously-polarized-pub-86190), [which is also growing around the world](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/11/16/most-across-19-countries-see-strong-partisan-conflicts-in-their-society-especially-in-south-korea-and-the-u-s/).
* Living standards in capitalist liberal democracies are decreasing, which sows doubt on the promises of capitalism and liberal democracy:
   * See "[Living standards tumbling in Australia despite booming national wealth](https://independentaustralia.net/politics/politics-display/living-standards-tumbling-in-australia-despite-booming-national-wealth,15747)" and "[Britons ‘need to accept’ they’re poorer, says Bank of England economist](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/25/britons-need-to-accept-theyre-poorer-says-bank-of-england-economist)".
   * Even if you blame external factors for these problems, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the Russian invasion of Ukraine, these events prove to us the resilience of authoritarian systems in the PRC and Russia in contrast to liberal democracies, as declining living standards don't destabilise them as much.
   * The large-scale international resurgence of the far-right is [partially fed by legitimate concerns of economic insecurity](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/31/across-europe-the-far-right-is-rising-that-it-seems-normal-is-all-the-more-terrifying).

To conclude, while I believe that Fukuyama's concepts have been debunked by recent history, I can also understand why Fukuyama made such claims in the 1990s. Back then, he wouldn't have been able to foresee the problems that we're facing now.</original_post>

    <text>Problem was, the United states, after the fall of the Soviet Union, decided to continue on as if the Cold War never ended. They had pushed an agenda of world conquest ever since the end of the 2nd world war, because if the US didn’t rule the world, the evil commies would, but when that fever dream ended, instead of shifting gears, decreasing defense spending, accepting the fact that there was no boogeyman to protect the homeland from, they just kept on with the game, meddling, overthrowing, invading, occupying, in their quest to become world sovereign, leading to an easily foreseeable response from every country willing and able to resist the international rules based order’s demands</text>

    <text>OK, but how does this CMV? I don't see anything in your theory that shows how Fukuyama's theory is still right.</text>

    <text>It could’ve been the end of history. The United States could’ve used soft power, disarmed, retired all the hawks, and eased the paranoid states into democracy. But they blew it.</text>

I mean, even if they did, that would just removed one of the factors (i.e. those outlined in Bin Laden's writings). The other factors (i.e. democratic backsliding being advantageous to rulers, economic woes) will still be there.</text>

    <text>Democratic backsliding is occasionally a product of US meddling. We have a way of manipulating voters.</text>

    <text>Did we? 

Still sounds presumptive to me, putting aside the fundamental misunderstanding of history within it that OP speaks to.</text>
