    <title>cmv: K-12 Educators push a false narrative that all college degrees are good investments</title>
    <original_poster>Suitable-Ad-8598</original_poster>
    <original_post>Students in high school are bombarded with pressure to go to college by educators, with high emphasis on the ranking of the schools they are accepted into and no emphasis on the majors that they choose.

Nobody is warning students that picking liberal arts majors (unless they go to an ivy league school or something like it), will probably make them financially worse off then not even getting a degree in the first place. I know a girl that did gender studies at Columbia and is working as a barista several years out of college and is in about $400,000 in debt. I went to a way worse school than Columbia and nearly all of my friends with liberal arts degrees are stuck working as cashiers and in food service. I know a ton of people who went to community colleges (which was highly frowned upon in my high school culture) who are making six figures a couple years out of school (STEM and sales).

Why are we not being honest with these kids about the consequences of incurring student debt in unusable majors? I am not saying people shouldn't have the right to make their own major choices, but this is like handing children a pack of cigarettes and not telling them it causes cancer.

Edit: I probably exaggerated when I said worse than no degree if we are talking about long-term in their livesâ€”I kind of meant in place of certifications or bootcamps.  What I should have said is that the lack of jobs in liberal arts fields seems to not be communicated to kids, which has significant negative financial consequences.

    <text>A quick look at Columbia gives an estimated tuition of about 11k per year for a family making about average annual income. After room and board the expected annual cost of attendance is under 30k on average. Over 4 years that 120k if paid 100% in loans. That would mean you'd need to be from a high income family with parents unwilling to support you to get -close- to 400k in student loan debt and even paying the sticker price of attendance 100% through loans you'd end up short.

You've made this whole thing up or are leaving out critical and highly situational information and it makes you look disingenuous.</text>

    <text>That largely agrees with my point that the 6 figure student debt from Columbia is an outlier.

Buy more specifically to OPs fictional friend: 400k student debt doesn't add up even if Columbia was paid for 100% from loans, which most people don't do.</text>
