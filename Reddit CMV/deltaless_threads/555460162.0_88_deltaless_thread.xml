    <title>CMV: Most people are not well read enough to reasonably advocate for political or economic change</title>

    <original_post>**Edit: "Well read" was a poor choice of words. I think "have done their due diligence" might be more accurate.**

I'm writing this because I want to be proven wrong, because people saying political things, especially as if obvious has started to annoy and anger me more. Especially if they're making fun of someone for their political views, even if I disagree with those views. I hate feeling angry, so hopefully writing my thoughts out will help.

In trying to figure out my own political views, I've come to realize that I can't reasonably hold the views I held, or any other views. I studied economics, mainly the school of thought that appealed to me. But then more and more I came to realize that I couldn't say if the Keynesian or post-keynesian or the Chicago school or MMT etc. were correct, and that even people who devote their lives to the study of economics struggle with the same thing. The same thing happened in philosophy, especially as I came to realize the importance of epistemology and ontology.

And you can't reasonably expect people to put in the effort and time that it takes to sort through these fields. And that there is still such debate among the experts that even if you become and expert, the truth will not be obvious. I've come to understand what Socrates meant when he said something like "I only know that I know nothing".

I've also come to believe that people hold the beliefs they do more for social reasons. Less for the truth of the beliefs, but more because their reaffirm their identity, and their social bonds.

I can't blame them for that, or for not spending thousands of hours sorting through political thought, philosophy and economics. But a part of me still believes that they haven't done their due diligence, and I get angry that they can affirm themselves and their beliefs, while I sit here uncertain, unable to succinctly articulate why, or how to get this across properly.</original_post>

    <text>I think the idea of democracy, certainly on the scale we are now, relies on enough people in the majority group being well-read enough in one specific field or another to steer society in the natural direction of best interest. Of course you get people like anti-vaxxers who clearly have no idea what their best interest actually is, but the purpose of voting on things, and everybody getting a vote, isn't based on cold hard facts, it's based on popular OPINION. If most people steer us towards a poor decision, so be it. It was EVERYBODY'S decision, and we made it. Good or bad.

I think you think of the human race (not to mention society) is in a static place of growth and nothing is changing, but we're witnessing the development of our race as we speak. Looking at the fundamentals of the argument philosophically, who are you (or who is any one person) to determine 100% good from 100% bad when good and bad, right and wrong is about perspective? That's why we all vote for things. For better or worse, we as a collective make the decisions that lead us where we're going. Survival of the fittest, I suppose.

Writing this super sleepy so I hope it makes sense and  isn't too rambling.</text>
