    <title>CMV: women are not going for the 'upper tier' of men</title>
    <original_poster>BadgerSame6600</original_poster>
    <original_post>I see this rhetoric over and over and over online, and hear it IRL sometimes.  It drives me crazy tbh. I am a man out in the world, living life, 35 years of it now. I have friends who are all over the spectrum of physical attractiveness. Some are single, most aren't. Their gfs/wifes are also across the spectrum. In most couples I know, friends and acquaintances,  the woman is better looking, earns more, or has more social skills ect. 

Now I know this is my experience, so it is anecdotal, but at the same time I just don't buy this whole women are too choosy. My opinion is that the dudes who say this are refusing to address their flaws and accept them. If these men believe this and they go out into the world feeling hard done by, fighting a losing battle, then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Most people can smell that level of victimhood a mile of. 

OK, open to have this challenge, so- change my view, Redditors! </original_post>

    <text>The problem is dating changed fundamentally. 

People used to date for long-term relationships. But now there’s a new bracket of dating “casual hook-ups.”

Hook-up culture is what really changed the dynamic. 

What you said is true for traditional dating. People who date to marry look at other characteristics for sure!

But those who are only dating for hook ups will often just select the top percent. And why wouldn’t they? It’s like if you’re going to watch a movie, you might as well sort them by their ratings. 

But again, the movie you watch on a casual Friday is not going to be the same movie that becomes your life long favorite. 

So always keep those two categories in mind when talking about relationships, because they define different values, and most people can’t even keep them separated lol.</text>

    <text>That's because both categories share the same initial stages and are often intentionally marketed as the other category.</text>
