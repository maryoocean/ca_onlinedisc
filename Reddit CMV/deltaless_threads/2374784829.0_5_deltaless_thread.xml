    <title>CMv: It shouldn't be illegal to speed; it should be impossible.</title>
    <original_poster>CaptainFunktastic</original_poster>
    <original_post>First of all, I'll assume this is for the US only.

To wit. There is no reason for "speeding" to be a finable, or jailable offense, when through the use of common, cheap tech, it could be impossible. Every car with a function on board computer gets a gps tracker installed which connects directly to the tranny, throttle, and speedometer. When the legal speed limit is reached, it cuts fuel, engages a rev limiter, or prevents the tranny from allowing an increase in speed.

A counter to any possible arguments:

* "No one said you have to speed!" I don't have to be punished either.

* "It's not the roll of the government to control my vehicle!" It's not it's roll to punish you either.

* "What if there's an emergency!" Please, any law enforcement or judges in the comments correct me if I'm wrong, but no jurisdiction in the country recognizes "an emergency" as an excuse to speed.

* "What if I'm being chased by a *bad guy*?" Well, if neither of you can go faster than the other, than so what. Also, refer to my previous statement.

* "It's my car!" Sure, but that doesn't matter on public roads.

* "What if I want to take it on the track?" Than you have it classified as a race car, and can never drive it on the road.

* "People will tamper with and disable it!* Sure. If caught, they'll spend a few years in prison for destruction of government property.

* "Speed and horsepower are only marketing gimmicks." So, it's legal to market something I'm not legally allowed to use?

* There are a lot of smaller towns that simply can't survive without ticket revenue". If your city, town, village, community, or municipality can't survive without fucking with it's drivers, maybe it's destined to fail.

* What if I have a [insert classic car here] which doesn't have a computer?" Let's face it, the only time it ever leaves the garage is to go to car shows because you're too afraid of injuring it's potential resale value. Load it on a truck and tow it.

* "I paid half a million for this car!" Well, congrats, you paid half a mil to do 40 mph.

* "My car drives like shit below [X]mph" Well, good job on your shoddy maintenance or your piss poor tune.

* "We should be trusted to operate a motor vehicle responsibly at all times, that what testing and licensing are for." Okay. We're hairless monkies with the the same brains we've had for millennia. Trusting us to operate two tons of explosion powered steel, filled with toxic chemicals, at speeds no living organism was ever meant to travel is a terrible idea.

Please. Change my view.

Edit: View changed. Congrats all!</original_post>

    <text>You know I think when self driving cars or better assisted driving is both possible and more widespread, this would be a good idea to revisit. 

But the way you've suggested this is just dangerous. Not only do people occasionally need to speed up to pass or to merge on an exit or to let someone else merge, but suddenly cutting your fuel in the middle of a motorway is very dangerous. The other cars around you may not have time to stop and likely don't, there's a reason you turn on your flashers for anything forcing you to significantly slow. 

&gt;What if I have a [insert classic car here] which doesn't have a computer?" Let's face it, the only time it ever leaves the garage is to go to car shows because you're too afraid of injuring it's potential resale value. Load it on a truck and tow it.

I don't mean to be condescending, but you must be young or in a wealthy area to believe this. It's not just vintage cars without this capability, it's a good deal of cars pre 2016 which at the expense that cars are, buying used, and how long people use cars for, is not that rare. My car is from 2009. And my aunt's is from 2010. There isn't a computer in our cars. If the battery dies I still have to put the anti theft code into the radio to turn it back on. 

&gt;"It's not the roll of the government to control my vehicle!" It's not it's roll to punish you either.

This isn't really related to my argument, just uh, this is literally not true. It is literally the role of the government to punish crime and to dictate what is a crime. Like...the governments role is to...govern.</text>
