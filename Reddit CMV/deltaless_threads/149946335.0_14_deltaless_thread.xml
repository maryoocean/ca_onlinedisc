    <title>CMV:The Giving Tree is a story with horrible morals.</title>
    <original_poster>Sinreborn</original_poster>
    <original_post>I am currently having this discussion with my wife. Both of us had the book read to us as children and my wife now reads it to our 2 year old. I can't stand this book. I believe it to be the personification of entitlement. For those unfamiliar, a tree (most likely signifying parents) provides a boy with anything he needs until he takes everything the tree can give leaving only the stump. The boy is absent when he doesn't want things and openly complains about what the tree offers. There is no thanks given by the boy at anytime and no acknowledgement that he is damaging the tree beyond repair. 

I get the notions of self sacrifice that go into being a parent. I understand that I would probably do the same to make sure my own child lived a happy life. But I don't want to encourage this notion of desecration without though for stewardship or appreciation for the gifts being given.

Please change my mind so I can stop fighting with my wife.

    <text>I think the whole point of the story is that it is so open. It is a philosophical story, which gets us to ask questions about happiness, empathy, giving, and love. The whole point about the ending isn't that it is a shallow but satisfying moral - instead it is an open, dissatisfying end, which leaves all our questions left unanswered, thus provoking us to think.

It's a way of opening conversations with your 2 year old. Who did you like best, the boy or the tree? What do you think the boy should have done? Do you think the tree was right?

You could have a great conversation and get to find out more about what your child thinks and feels as well as getting the chance to share your own values. Give them stuff that makes them think and question, not just empty entertainment!</text>
