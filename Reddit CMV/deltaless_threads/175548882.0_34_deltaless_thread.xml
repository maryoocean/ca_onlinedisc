    <title>CMV: Public transportation should run 24/7.</title>
    <original_poster>Keep-reefer-illegal</original_poster>
    <original_post>We live in a world that is no longer 9-5. Businesses stay open later, friends can reach us with a portable device simply by typing on a mini keyboard. It doesn't make sense that public transportation isn't 24/7. Here are some reasons why it should be 24/7:

1. Very few buses run at 2 am for last call, I feel like if nothing else, running buses later let's responsible drunk people take public transit instead of driving home. 

2. It would benefit the working poor who may work night shift 

3. As mentioned before our world is now 24/7 

Those are my arguments. 

I encourage you all to change my view 

Edit: by transit I am including trains, buses, all forms of public transportation, not just buses.

    <text>Because the cost will outweigh the benefit. 

To put it in terms, lets imagine that 10% of all public ridership would like to ride late night on public transportation, which in most cities is probably a significant overestimation, but lets just say it were so. Public transportation isn't 100% scalable. So, if for example 10% of people need public transportation, you can't necessarily cut service and cost by 90% and meet that demand. For example, to run the same routes, you will need to service areas where ridership is as little as 1 person. You can't really scale a bus to service that 1 person. You have to at least provide a bus. If public transportation is to run 24/7, you will have to be running buses for small volumes of ridership. You will be spending the full cost of a bus for a tiny fraction of the benefit. So your return on investment per rider will be dramatically diminished. So while normally we might spend say $1 per rider, for night shifts we may be spending $5 or even $10 per rider. 

Now as a matter of principle you must agree that *at some point* the cost of ridership exceeds any expected benefits. For example if it cost $1 million to transport a rider to their destination, you would surely agree that this is cost prohibitive. If you accept that as a matter of principle that there is some upper limit of cost where the benefits do not justify said costs, the question becomes *what is that cost and is it justified by the benefit?* In this case, the benefit is transporting a small percentage of the population, a population that generally gets paid a differential to account for the inconvenience of the shift. 

As it stands, that population has *already* managed to figure out how to get to and from their job, so there isn't a clear absolute *need* for this service, since the present system works. It is a question then of whether your proposed solution is somehow *better* than the existing system. Since your system is not strictly *necessary*, a cost benefit analysis is perfectly appropriate. So, is the added cost of a public transportation network that runs off shift worth the benefit of providing that public transportation for a small number of workers that already have the means to get to and from their place of work? In particular, you should consider that one of the major benefits of public transportation is that it relieves congestion, allowing us to ferry more people more efficiently. This benefit doesn't really apply to shift workers because road demand is far lower during off shits, meaning that congestion really isn't an issue needing to be solved for those workers. Public transportation isn't really intended as some sort of generalized social program or entitlement, it is an infrastructure *solution*. That solution is completely unnecessary in this case. 

Personally, I would say that the increase cost would have to be very low indeed to justify such a trivial benefit. Each person's opinion on what cost is justified will naturally be different, but the fact is that nearly *everyone* would agree that cost *is* a relevant consideration before drawing a conclusion. As neither you nor I have cost figures, the reasonable position would seem to be "this could be a good benefit, but it depends on the cost of the program." However you never qualify your argument in that way. Your position seems to be "we should do this" without cost even being a consideration. I therefore think your position is poorly considered. </text>
