    <title>CMV: Debt forgiveness is one of the stupidest ideas ever conceived</title>
    <original_poster>Ndlaxfan</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'll start this off by saying that I am in my last year of high school, and I will hopefully be attending a school that is about 60k a year. However, I will be graduating with under 5k in debt. I've worked my ass off for scholarships, and so far I've gotten about 205 k paid for. Most of the debt-forgiveness advocates are students who bit off more than they can chew, and will be swimming in piles of debt. If the government completely forgave debts, then they completely dick every financial institution in America. I view it like this: why would you go to an upscale restaurant, gorge yourself with food, and then be pissed off and demand that you can't pay the bill?</original_post>

    <text>No everybody can get a scholarship - that's the nature of scholarships. However ideally we would want a society where everybody has a decent education. A better educated society is better for everybody. From this point of view its insane to have tuition fees in the first place.

What if your restaurant example was applied to primary and secondary education as well? Should children who can't afford an education not be allowed to "gorge" on it? We should be moving towards a society that expands that right for the sake of a better future for all.</text>
