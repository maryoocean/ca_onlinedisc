    <original_post>I believe everyone is racist just some people are more racist than others.

No matter how tolerant we try to be we are all ignorant to certain group(s) and because of that ignorance we make assumptions about certain groups of people.


As human beings we still have the primitive instinct to attack or run away from anything that looks different than us and in this case people who look different from us.

We all make assumptions.  For example, if you live in a predominately white neighborhood and you happen to see a group of black people hanging out you will notice something is a bit off.  These black people might be law biding citizens who isn't doing anything wrong but you don't know that.  You can say the same for any race but the point is if you see something "different" it will stick out to you and everyone else.  The same example can be the other way around and there can be a group of whites in a black neighborhood and that will stick out and you'll still make assumptions.

    <text>I don't feel any different walking down a street approaching a black guy or a white/chinese person. I don't know what you mean by racist but I found that the key, my key to overcoming social anxiety is to recognize everyone the same as you. They generally have the same hopes, fears, pattern of thoughts as you. We are a pretty homogeneous bunch, it's not pop-PC-culture.

If you think like that it's pretty hard to be racist. It's pretty hard to think of anyone as different from you or your brother when you think like that, plus it makes you more confident and less afraid of people, black or white. If white skin or black freaks you out, though, that's lack of exposure and interaction can cure that like *snap.

We do have an urge to run away from things that look different from us.. On second thought we don't. The first time Kamehameha, a warrior king of Hawaii, saw a cow, he killed it thinking it was a monster. We got used to cows, though, and to dogs and to cats. Blonde people don't run from redheads so it's not intrinsic to us, it's just lack of exposure.</text>
