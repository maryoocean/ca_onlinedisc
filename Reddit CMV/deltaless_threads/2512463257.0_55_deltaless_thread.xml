    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>The banning of turbans is miseducated at best.

The uncut hair is the religious symbol, not the Turban.  I am sure now you want Sikhs to cut their hair in public, from your other comments.  Not allowing Sikhs to wear a turban is taking away their rights (something Quebec already did by bypassing the Federal charter of human rights).

No one is upset at France?  How miseducated do you have to be to think that.  There are currently huge riots going on in France.  You tell me why.

School isn’t a place of religion, it’s a place of education and community.  What you’re trying to do is take away the kids’ identity and their rights because you said</text>
