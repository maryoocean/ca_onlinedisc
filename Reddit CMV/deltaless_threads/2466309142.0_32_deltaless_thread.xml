    <title>CMV: I hate America with a burning passion</title>
    <original_poster>HoovyKitty</original_poster>
    <original_post> I am a European and I've visited America for a couple of weeks before (east coast) but I just hate America and a lot of American's for some reason. The joke here has always been that American's are fat and stupid, but I always took that joke with a grain of salt, but ever since I vistied, I've believed that statement and agreed with it fully. I hate all of the food in America and how it's bland and fattening, I hate Americans all over the internet treating America like the center of the world, I hate it when I google something and the results are about America instead of the world, I also hate the stupid (to me) measurements like pounds (written lbs??) feet, inches, miles and whatnot. Also, I don't get their obsession with guns, I've never understood how they can have so many shootings, and I get that it's a massive country, but compared to the entirety of Europe it's still insane. The thing is, there are countries in Europe and elsewhere that have way more things that I dislike about them, hell, even my own country sucks, everyone here is depressed, hates themselves and hates eachother and we still suffer from Russian influence, but for some reason America just makes me want to make fun of it and hate it way more.</original_post>

    <text>America is a huge place with lots of different people.  There is northern Wisconsin which is all forest, and very low population.  There are responsible gun owners who use them to hunt deer in places where responsible hunting is necessary in order to manage wild life population and prevent animals from starving through the winter.   There are irresponsible gun owners who live in the city and don't store them safely and everywhere in between.  I was about 30 years old when I saw a gun for the first time.  I've still only seen a gun one time in my life and it was when a friend of mine who immigrated from the UK bought one.

Hate is a strong word, but there is more or less nothing wrong with hating bad guys who do bad things.

I don't really trust it, but two google search's say that the US and EU have obesity rates of 40% and 52%.  There are probably some different metrics at play there, but point being there are fat Americans and fat Europeans.  You hat America because we have a higher percentage of fat people?

People love the measurement system they are used to.  You know what 21c feels like and you don't know what 75f feels like.  You like the system you know.

&gt;we still suffer from Russian influence, but for some reason America just makes me want to make fun of it and hate it way more.

I imagine Russian propaganda doesn't paint America in a very positive light...</text>
