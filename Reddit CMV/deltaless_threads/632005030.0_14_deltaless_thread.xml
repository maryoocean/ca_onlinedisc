    <title>CMV: The Republican party could guarantee a victory in the next election if they would reach out to labor unions.</title>
    <original_poster>humbleprotector</original_poster>
    <original_post>While Ronald Reagan was a very anti-union president, the Democratic party championed for labor. But in recent history Bill Clinton drafted NAFTA. With the Democratic support of Outsourcing USA Jobs and now open borders they lost a tremendous amount of loyal supporters. The AFL-CIO is a massive lobby group with one of the largest voter support of any but they saw their support fractured in the last election because of policies pushed by the Democratic Party, and the effects of the democratic economy. Forcing an American worker to compete with illegal wages, and with third world wages is not Labour friendly and loyal Democratic voters are leaving because they haven't seen a return for all their loyal support. Change my view.....</original_post>

    <text>NAFTA came into force under Clinton but it was signed by George H.W. Bush in 1992. You're not wrong looking at the bigger picture though: It's the case that both parties underwent a "neoliberal" restructuring (first with Reagan in the Republican Party and the Democrats followed suit under the Clintonite "New Democrat" model).

I think both parties are restructuring. We'll see how 2020 shakes out but there's a vocal pro-labor contingent in the Democrats that is growing and represented by Bernie Sanders. They basically want a return to the pre-Reagan model characterized by FDR when organized labor was at its most powerful in the United States. The fact that this is at odds with the "New Democrat" types is why there is an internal conflict within the Democratic Party -- how that conflict is resolved will matter the most I think.

The Republicans are not pro-*labor* broadly speaking but prefer to favor particular *industries* that face risks on the global marketplace. These include manufacturing and resource extraction (two big ones). But the working class has changed a lot since the 1950s and a big chunk of it is rooted in services these days. The reason Trump was able to consolidate control over his party is because there is less daylight between him and the rest of the GOP. Ultimately the people who benefit the most under Republican policies are the executives and owners of those particular industries and not labor broadly speaking.</text>
