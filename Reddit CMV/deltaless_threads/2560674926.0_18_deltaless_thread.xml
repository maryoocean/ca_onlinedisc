    <title>CMV: Focusing on ideological purity does not win elections</title>
    <original_poster>LaserWerewolf</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have encountered many people who openly say that they hate centrists more than they hate their actual political opponents. Fair enough, because ideologically they often have more in common with their opponents than with a genuine centrist, but when the election comes around the same people often ask why more centrists don't vote for their candidates. I don't know about you, but I think voting for people who hate me seems like a questionable idea. 

I have also noticed that in certain echo chambers (possibly this is a general feature of echo chambers) people are often insulted, verbally abused, or even excluded if they do not share every single belief common to the people in that echo chamber. Often this person then leaves and joins a different echo chamber where they are more welcome. 

Let's say that a person starts out in a Party A echo chamber. They agree with 9 out of 10 of the main Party A viewpoints. But because they disagree with Party A one one single viewpoint, they are pushed out of the echo chamber by people who demand ideological purity.

Now let's imagine that Party B says, "It is enough for us that you agree with us about this one viewpoint. We accept you." The person now joins a Party B echo chamber.

I think this person would most likely start agreeing with Party B more and with Party A less after switching to the Party B echo chamber. I also think this person would be less likely to vote for a Party A candidate and more likely to vote for a Party B candidate after switching to a Party B echo chamber. 

To change my view, you would have to persuade me that focusing on ideological purity causes a greater number of people to vote for one's party. Bonus points if you can back this up with some kind of statistical data, but a purely logical argument could also be convincing.

    <text>The whole 'centrism' discussion seems to be very much focused on the USA (plus some folks who desperately want to import this discussion). What you write, OP, is pretty clear for most European parties hence most parties try to ride the 'pragmatist' approach anyway. In most countries, coalitions are the outcome of an election anyway. 

There is another side to the problem and that is the whole terminology of 'centrism' or 'center' anyway. Guys like r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM make fun of centrists who say that they are 'neither left nor right' but then repeat rightoid points. Fair enough, but sometimes it is a bit unfair. The main problem is that 'center' has a lot more problems with its definition than left or right, progressive or conservative. It's always in motion and sometimes more leftish or rightish depending on the context.</text>
