    <title>CMV: If I'm not guilty, I want to be tried by a judge rather than a jury</title>
    <original_poster>Mimshot</original_poster>
    <original_post>In the American criminal justice system you have the *right* to a jury trial, but you are not obligated to exercise your right a jury. It's possible to have what's known as a "bench trial" where in addition to determining the admissibility of evidence, and sentencing if convicted, the judge determines guilt or innocence as well.

Jury trials are notoriously unpredictable, therefore if I'm actually not guilty of a crime, I want a professional judging my case. Historically, bench trials result in acquittals [more often than from juries](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/judge_v_judge). I understand wanting to be judged by someone who never saw inadmissible evidence, if I'm guilty but the evidence was illegally obtained, but if I'm actually not guilty, why should I take a chance with a jury?

Change my view.

    <text>Judges have bias just like everyone else. I'm not going to attempt to CYV, as all I have is anecdotal evidence, but the laconic version:

Custody Battle with Ex. Half way through, she accuses me of abuse. "No Tangible Evidence" - but I still went to Trial for "Domestic Violence." 

I beat the case, found "not guilty" but later found that the Judge goes to Jehovah's Witness Church with my sons Grandmother and is close friends with the Prosecutor. He disallowed several pieces of vital evidence (including several text messages threatening to have me thrown in jail because this is a "womans state") which had my Lawyer and me perplexed. 

Had the Judge tried me, I am 99% sure he would have found me guilty and thrown the book at me. Luckily that wasn't the case. I eventually got custody of my son, too. But that's a different judge and a different story. 

You just never know. I'd rather trust my fate to a group of strangers  given information to go by than a Judge who plays golf with the Prosecutor. 

And that's not counting that neither the Judge nor the Prosecutor care about you, they care about numbers and conviction rates. In some places, Judges have stakes in the local jails and prisons or have political aspirations so "high conviction rates" look good. There are just too many variables to trusting my fate to a single person. </text>
