    <title>CMV: You should be allowed to take drugs and alter your conciousness in the safety of your own home.</title>
    <original_poster>Cheezefebreeze</original_poster>
    <original_post>I believe that the government goes too far in deciding whether or not you are allowed to take drugs in the safety of your own home. You don’t stand to harm others, you only risk hurting yourself.

You can go rock climbing, skydiving, wingsuiting, rally driving and so on. 99% of the time nothing happens, and no harm is done. The same goes for drugs.

The war on drugs has done more harm than good. People who start out abuse drugs are usually doing pretty bad, and they cover up the void. That drug use only perpetuates the problem. You start failing economically, your social life declines, and the ditch just becomes too deep, so you can’t get out.

People have bad mental health, and self-medicate. I’ve been there. For me it was weed, for my grandfather it was alcohol, for some it is meth, and there are several other addictive behaviours in completely normal things, that are used to cover up a mental wound, something that hurts. Just like you get painkillers for a wound to numb the pain.

In every single drug, the abuse percentage is roughly 10%. Most users use it recreationally and only once in a while. A small part of users use it compulsively at some point in their lives.

The drug isn’t the problem, it lies in mental health. One in four people will suffer from a mental health issue during their lifetime.

Now, I don’t use drugs compulsively. I do it with friends sometimes. Sometimes I might light up a joint to unwind after work, and sometimes I take psychedelics, to expand my understanding of myself, and the world around me.

What I do at home harms doesn’t harm a single soul. What I do with my friend is nothing but bonding and fun. 

People should be allowed to do what they want, and even **if** it poses a risk, they should be allowed to do it, just as rock climbing or skydiving poses a risk.

I’d seriously like to expand my understanding of the arguments for why this shouldn’t be. We live in a world where it isn’t, and as such, I’d like to understand why.

Thank you.</original_post>

    <text>Unlike skydiving or whitewater rafting, the potential societal cost of drug use is very high as there are far more drug users than extreme sports people.

Part of the thing that keeps abuse numbers low is the relative rarity of hard drugs in society. Everyone knows a weed guy or knows where to buy a beer, not everyone has a heroin guy.

The real cost of overdoses from just opiods and loss of productivity is estimated in the tens of billions in the US alone. So while it is a mental health issue, the actual cost of just one drug group's unintended consequences is insanely high.

Avoiding overdoses for certain kinds of drugs is hard, even when they are made in a lab. Pill abuse in the US is from misappropriation of pharmaceuticals. So even if all drugs were legal and regulated from labs, we still have evidence that people would overdose regardless.

While criminalising drugs adds extra problems unto the lives of users, decriminalisation would only increase the total societal burden. In countries that have decriminalisation, like Portugal, multiple civil servants and doctors are assigned to people when they are caught with a dangerous amount of drugs. 

Part of the reason it works for them is because of their very small population, cheap medical care, and high social tax burden, as well as, a limited geographic region, especially for drug users. 

America for instance, has none of those advantages, so the real cost of decriminalisation would be astronomical in the current state of things.</text>

    <text>The safeguard against overdosing on low OD threshold drugs like Heroin or Fentanyl would be that they have to be measured by clinicians and administered on-site. This seems like a lot of work, but the swiss did it and it didn’t cost much. You create a safety net around the users, offer them help, and have a social circle that surrounds it. And you will see good results, just as the swiss did.

And yes, America doesn’t really fit into this model that well. But this model is not made for a country like America. Because the US has a lot more to do if it wants to get rid of drug problems, like raising taxes, creating a wider social security net, etc.

The war on drugs is already a huge societal burden. Creating tons more jobs in the industry, and diverting the tax money that funds the war on drugs and prisons onto other more important things will probably do a huge service to society. One can only imagine.</text>
