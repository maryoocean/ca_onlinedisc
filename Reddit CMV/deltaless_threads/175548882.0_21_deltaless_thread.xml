    <title>CMV: Public transportation should run 24/7.</title>
    <original_poster>Keep-reefer-illegal</original_poster>
    <original_post>We live in a world that is no longer 9-5. Businesses stay open later, friends can reach us with a portable device simply by typing on a mini keyboard. It doesn't make sense that public transportation isn't 24/7. Here are some reasons why it should be 24/7:

1. Very few buses run at 2 am for last call, I feel like if nothing else, running buses later let's responsible drunk people take public transit instead of driving home. 

2. It would benefit the working poor who may work night shift 

3. As mentioned before our world is now 24/7 

Those are my arguments. 

I encourage you all to change my view 

Edit: by transit I am including trains, buses, all forms of public transportation, not just buses.

    <text>I live in Copenhagen, Denmark and here public transportation already runs 24/7. Including buses, metro and inner city trains. The metro arrives every 20 minutes between 12-5 am. 

I'm a student and no one I know of my fellow students own a car. I got my driver's license at 26, and I didn't have a bicycle for years until recently. I know this wouldn't work for many cities in America because of urban sprawl, but it can work some places evidently. </text>
