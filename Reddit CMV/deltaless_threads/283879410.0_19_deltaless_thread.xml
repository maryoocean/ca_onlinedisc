    <title>CMV: 'Jump scares' are a cheap party trick, and movies that are full of them shouldn't be considered horror</title>

Lately I've noticed that most horror movies rely on jump scares. Something will unexpectedly pop out at the audience, a loud noise will startle everyone, you know the works. Sometimes the movie tries to trick people into believing that a certain scene will have a jump scare, to make the viewer feel safe, and then do a jump scare in the next scene.

I think that movies like Paranormal Activity, The Conjuring and The Darkness do not do their best to scare the audience in a creative way.

Jump scares do something physical to your body. Sometimes my mom jumps out at the me when I walk through the door, to elicit a scream or a 'fear' reaction from me. However, a second later I'm just laughing because it's silly and not at all scary.

When I go see a movie at the theater that has a lot of jump scares, most of the audience members just seem to be laughing. You may hear a collective gasp or a scream, but that's just a reflex. 

Most movies riddled with jump scares do not leave an impression on me. I find them annoying.

Jump scares do not tell a story that sends shivers down your spine and causes you to lay awake at night. Jump scares do not show you a gruesome scene that will be burned into your mind for the weeks to come.

Jump scares are cheap party tricks. They are annoying and do not elicit any feelings of terror. 

Change my view.

    <text>Here's a perspective OP,

My understanding of your stance is that since jump scares either do not frighten you or do not leave you terrorized for a satisfactory duration, you do not consider them legitimate horror elements. While this is all understandable from an individual's point of view, generalizing it for all the horror movie audiences gets sketchy. 

Here's why - 

a) The movies you quoted have the following box office collections 1) Paranormal Activity Series - $889,730,075 2) The Conjuring - $137,387,272 3) Darkness - $10,658,462 (Source - IMDB and Wikipedia)

b) Paranormal Activity has had six movies now released under that banner. The Conjuring has had its sequel released recently. Certainly if these movies primarily employ jump scares which lack horror quotient, people wouldn't be paying to see and there won't be a franchise. 

The crux of my point is that you are basing your definition of horror strictly on your experience of the movie and its employed horror elements ie jump scares. The definition of horror movies as gleaned from their performance on box-office shows that jump scares do work as a horror element for other audiences.</text>
