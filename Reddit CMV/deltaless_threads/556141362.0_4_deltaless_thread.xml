    <title>CMV: Fines should scale according to the person's wealth</title>
    <original_poster>onlyfoolandhorse</original_poster>
    <original_post>...or some other punishment should be included. The punishment should be worse depending on how much money people have.  


Fines are supposed to be a deterrent.  
For a deterrent to work the accused must want to avoid the penalty i.e. the fine.  
A billionaire hardly minds if he gets a Â£200 fine!

Notes:  
 \- Sometimes this wouldn't be possible, but when it is possible the extra admin would be well worth it.   
 \- Additional punishments could include some sort of public shaming, more driving licence points deducted, etc. I don't know, just anything which puts wealthier people off commiting crimes. It doesn't necessarily have to be money, although money makes sense as it could go towards helping victims of the crime (e.g. helping victims of speeding motorists).</original_post>

    <text>There's also an idea that the punishment should be somewhat proportional to the damage/severity of the "crime". In many cases making the fine scale with person's wealth would break this rule.

The thing is that it might happen that for a wealthier person e.g. jail time may be more destructive than for a poor person. So if we followed the gist of your idea, we may end up with a **rule** that the wealthier person may actually get lower punishment on some crimes than the poor person. </text>
