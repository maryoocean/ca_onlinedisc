    <title>Childless adults should not go to Disneyland and Disneyworld. These are for children and families, and adults have the entire world to experience. CMV.</title>
    <original_poster>dbarefoot</original_poster>
    <original_post>As an adult of moderate means, you have access to the adventures and experiences that Disneyland (and related parks) simulate. You can go whitewater rafting, tour Czech castles and Parisian catacombs and sail the actual Caribbean. Disneyland is obviously an amusement targeted at children, and so adults without children should seek alternative forms of entertainment.

As a more practical addendum to the above, I gather that Disneyland and other parks are exceptionally busy, often resulting in long lines for the attendees. If adults without children eschewed them, then they'd actually be enriching the experience for the parks' target audience.

EDIT (Sept. 4, 19:00 CET): I'm afraid I'm out of time to respond to other comments--thanks for the conversation.</original_post>

    <text>I dare say that the vast majority of adults cannot afford to tour Czech castles or sail the Caribbean. Sure, the lucky ones do, but most do not. 

Furthermore, the main purpose of amusement parks is to provide amusement. If you find amusement there, then they are designed for you, regardless of whether you are 4, 15, 25 or 65 years old. 

Whilst Disneyland and Disney world cater to those fascinated by a world of imagination, I do not see a reason why this should be restricted to children. Granted, they are more likely to respond to it than adults, but if there are adults who do find happiness there, why is their happiness worth less than that of the children who go there? </text>

    <text>Let's assume that by 'vast majority of adults', we mean those in Western democracies. Agreed? 

If so, it's within most adults reach to visit the Czech Republic or the Caribbean. Many, many poor college students do the former every year, and while the Caribbean is expensive, one could get a similar experience far more cheaply in Panama, Costa Rica or a dozen other places around the Gulf of Mexico.

I guess I feel that adults shouldn't settle for a manufactured simulacrum of an adventure or travel experience. That is, they ought to aspire to a greater level of emotional and intellectual engagement than Disneyland can possibly offer.</text>

    <text>Emotional and intellectual enjoyment is not significantly correlated with how manufactured something is.

Many teenagers and adults prefer anime or cartoons to live action. Many prefer video games to sport.

What if an adult felt that going to the Panama, Costa Rica, or a dozen other places was settling and that going to Disneyland was what they really wanted?</text>

Our discussion is about adults, not teenagers. I don't know if anime is childish or not, so I can't compare that to 'live action', which in itself includes everything from Pee Wee's Playhouse to, say, Masterpiece Theatre.

The average gamer is well into his thirties now, and most popular games are designed to include an adult audience. So, I'm not sure that's a particular applicable example.

They're free to do so. I just think they're doing themselves (and the children whose queues they are lengthening) a disservice. </text>

We're talking about adults and teenagers actually, since you mentioned poor college students.

Games are manufactured simulacrums of adventures. They're a very applicable example- many prefer manufactured simulacrums to the real deal. Fantasy and Sci Fi are very popular too.

&amp;gt;They're free to do so. I just think they're doing themselves (and the children whose queues they are lengthening) a disservice. 

If they enjoy Disneyland more than a 'real' holiday then they are doing themselves a service. 

And likewise, the children are lengthening their queues, so the children are doing them a disservice.</text>

    <text>I am sorry, but do you have statistics you can back these claims up with? 

I went to university in a Western democracy. In fact, in quite a wealthy city. Whilst many students did indeed travel, I would say it wasn't the majority. In fact, from my circle, I would say 10%. 

Not even going into the fact that sailing the Caribbean and going to Disneyworld are two completely different experiences. One is travelling. The other is an amusement park. One costs over £1,000 pounds and takes two weeks, the other is in the range of £100 and takes a few hours. One stimulates reality. The other fantasy. </text>

    <text>Unless you live in certain parts of California or Florida (or Paris, if that's still a thing), going to a Disney property involves traveling. These are popular travel destinations. I'm not talking about your local funfair.

The average ticket costs [about $90](http://www.hlntv.com/article/2012/06/04/taking-family-4-disney-save) per day per person, before any other spending. [Here are some sample pricing plans](http://wdwprepschool.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-go-to-disney-world/) for families traveling to Disneyland.

If two adults can afford $180 a day before flights, car rentals, accommodation and food, then they can afford to travel to any number of domestic or international destinations. </text>

    <text>As a childless adult who has lived in Southern California and used to have an annual pass to Disneyland, my experience suggests that the vast majority of people who travel far to go to Disneyland are families with children. The childless adults who go to Disneyland are mostly locals for whom it is relatively affordable to go to Disneyland on a regular basis. My guess would be that there aren't very many childless adults who travel far to go to these kind of parks.</text>
