    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>I dont know who was criticizing you...but 18 yrs ago when I traveled Europe, people from Europe often referred to me as "American" even though I told them I was from Canada (Canadian) and that US citizens were Americans.  It seems to be something they get taught, maybe?  I dunno.  Maps in Europe also have the hemispheres swapped and Canada is listed as "Canadia" because we're are Canadians.  /facepalm

I guess my point is, just because they are in Europe doesn't make their geography knowledge any better than us.</text>
