    <title>CMV: Kink and BDSM should not be at public pride events and should be kept for 18+ ones</title>

    <original_post>To start, I am a lesbian. And I've been seeing recent controversy about this topic. 

Look, no denying that kink plays a big role in the creation of pride. It is a part of embracing sexuality and shouldn't be excluded from the community. 

However, it should not be at public pride parades. Pride should be for everyone of all ages. Many people say "stop catering to the straight capitalized ideal of what pride should be" and "pride isn't a party, it's a protest don't police us" and "children should go to disney if they want family friendly" This has nothing to do with straight rainbow capitalism. I figured out I was LGBT at age 11 and trust me if I saw a kink act in public I would be kind of disgusted. I'm still a minor now, and I'd be less disgusted but still. I know people say that it's up to you to bring your children to pride, but by making all pride events "wear whatever you want even if it's nothing" we are also kinda excluding minors from it. It's also non consensual to anyone who is exposed to such acts, because nobody wants to go to pride to see naked people right? The "think of the children" phrase holds true here. Young children and teens embracing their sexuality shouldn't be forced to see adult acts against their will. 

Again, no denying the role kink plays in the community, but it should be kept at 18+ events. There should definitely be a separate pride for people who just want to do leather and other kinks. That way, you can do whatever you want in a safe space where you know you won't offend others, and because people consented to come to an 18+ event, it's all good. 

That's just my personal opinion on it, but it seems to be the minority. I'd like to see how you guys think about this.

Edit: it appears after reading and responding to several comments, I don't really have a problem with kink, but more with public indecency. I don't care if you wear a collar or leather pants. But I'd rather not see things that could get you arrested or questioned for doing in public.</original_post>

    <text>Not exactly a contrary opinion but here goes. In recent times it seems that the lgbtquia+ movement has expanded to the point of dilution. There are so many different sects within the same organization that there is bound to be people inside one group who don't agree with the actions or beliefs of another. Speaking anecdotally from my own experiences, lesbian girls that i've been friends with over the years really don't like trans women as they view it as just another guy trying to have sex with girls who don't want to have sex with guys. Ive also noticed that a lot of gay/lesbian people view bisexual people as confused in the same way straight people view gay people as confused. Within this fragmentation there is room for people who are just there in a fetish capacity, EG BDSM, DDLG and other inherently sexual "ways of life". IMHO pride and other pro sexual equality movements should distance themselves from these groups as it just dilutes the message of equality and moves it towards a lewd parade instead of a fight for equal rights.</text>
