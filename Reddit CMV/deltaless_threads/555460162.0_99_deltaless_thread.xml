    <title>CMV: Most people are not well read enough to reasonably advocate for political or economic change</title>

    <original_post>**Edit: "Well read" was a poor choice of words. I think "have done their due diligence" might be more accurate.**

I'm writing this because I want to be proven wrong, because people saying political things, especially as if obvious has started to annoy and anger me more. Especially if they're making fun of someone for their political views, even if I disagree with those views. I hate feeling angry, so hopefully writing my thoughts out will help.

In trying to figure out my own political views, I've come to realize that I can't reasonably hold the views I held, or any other views. I studied economics, mainly the school of thought that appealed to me. But then more and more I came to realize that I couldn't say if the Keynesian or post-keynesian or the Chicago school or MMT etc. were correct, and that even people who devote their lives to the study of economics struggle with the same thing. The same thing happened in philosophy, especially as I came to realize the importance of epistemology and ontology.

And you can't reasonably expect people to put in the effort and time that it takes to sort through these fields. And that there is still such debate among the experts that even if you become and expert, the truth will not be obvious. I've come to understand what Socrates meant when he said something like "I only know that I know nothing".

I've also come to believe that people hold the beliefs they do more for social reasons. Less for the truth of the beliefs, but more because their reaffirm their identity, and their social bonds.

I can't blame them for that, or for not spending thousands of hours sorting through political thought, philosophy and economics. But a part of me still believes that they haven't done their due diligence, and I get angry that they can affirm themselves and their beliefs, while I sit here uncertain, unable to succinctly articulate why, or how to get this across properly.</original_post>

    <text>I used to have the same opinion. Low engagement politics and economics usually seems like more signal than noise. More recently I've come to think that, despite the noise, a small amount of political engagement by a large amount of people isn't just an important thing, it's literally how our democracy is capable of functioning.

Net neutrality is a good example of this. I bet 9 out of 10 supporters who sign petitions and call their senators about about net neutrality know less about the issue than their senator does. 9 out of 10 couldn't make a solid argument for why telling your ISPs what they can't sell is a good thing, but telling google what they can't sell is a bad thing.

I think that's okay. There's also a lot of \*informed\* discussion happening about this issue. Little pieces of that fully informed discussion are really resonating with a huge number of people. These little pieces may not be the whole picture, but the fact that their resonating so loudly and so broadly is a huge signal saying \*this issue is important\*". That signal matters a lot, because it means, not only is this argument intellectually sound, but it also matters in the right way to the right number of people.

Our political system is inherently adversarial. Any group of people who less engaged will eventually see that system start to disadvantage them. In this system, there's really only a few things you can do: vote for policies, vote for politicians who will support policies that support your, and tell politicians how their policies will affect your votes.

Maybe along the way, some people's character judgements are inaccurate. Maybe some of their economic concepts they know aren't as certain as they think. But it's better than total disengagement.

tl;dr: The arc of democracy is long, but it bends towards justice.</text>
