    <title>CMV: Accusations alone should not be printed by the media.</title>
    <original_poster>OGHuggles</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't care what percentage of them are true, innocent till proven guilty is a thing. The erosion of privacy and civil liberties is of great concern to me now and in the future. While I'm glad plenty of women that would have been ignored before aren't anymore, I don't think accusations should be straight up believed. I think they should be taken seriously, but they should not get media attention until a case is actually made. 

False accusations are a thing and lives have been ruined because of them. The most infamous case of this guilty before proven innocent going wrong, is the Duke Lacross case I'm sure most people have heard of.

Why should I not be concerned about this? Why is it ok to ruin people's lives based off of accusations alone?

    <text>I do believe they should, because it makes me more discerning.  
To be aware that there is context around the grabby Headline of an article makes me less likely to blindly accept what they're saying as truth.

If I knew for a fact that when I read someone's name in the news, they are already proven to have done it, it would build up my trust of the media too much.

It gives me fact-checking skills.</text>
