    <title>CMV: U.S. Expenditures on defense is why there is so few terrorist attacks</title>
    <original_poster>KS1867</original_poster>
    <original_post>On Reddit the U.S. gets a lot of flak for spending so much on its defense budget. People often use the argument "[some uncommon event] kills more people a year than terrorists." I argue that this is because of our massive intelligence and military capabilities. Another hot button issue on Reddit seems to be the use of drones and many will argue that our drone program makes more enemies than it kills. Although I do recognize the flaws with our drone program I believe stopping is not a solution and the drone program weakens the capabilities of terrorists networks to effectively plan attacks. I subscribe to the "peace means carrying a big stick" philosophy. Change my view on American defense spending and drones.  </original_post>

    <text>"carrying a big stick" is what causes terrorism. Terrorism is asymmetric warfare because there can be no conventional warfare between the two sides. By spending what we do, and flaunting it, and threatening to use it, we create a situation where those who oppose us meddling in their affairs have to attack us how they can. By waiting and attacking when reactive players are in charge (Bush43), terrorists can use our own weight against us by forcing us to spend huge amounts of money which hurts our economy and alienating us from our allies. I expect a major terrorist attack on the US within the first year of the Trump presidency as he's a much easier target than Bush43 was. 

The drones can and do kill our enemies, but they also kill a lot of innocent civilians, which is propaganda that can be used for years. It also pushes us further from our allies as they can't be seen being too cozy with the assholes bombing civilian populations. </text>
