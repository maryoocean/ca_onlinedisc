    <title>CMV: If gender is a social construct, then so is race</title>
    <original_poster>BoppeBoye</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let us take, as a given, that gender is divorced from the circumstances of your birth, that it is not a mental illness, and that there is no biological basis for what gender identity someone should express. Have I phrased that effectively? I'm trying to be concise, but I want to portray that premise correctly.

Why, then, should race be different than gender? If race carries with it "shared experience" and "lived experience", etc - that assumes that the only way you could understand what it's like to be a minority is to have lived your entire life as that particular minority. I'm not arguing against that, I agree that there are certain experiences that I could not comprehend - for instance, overbearing &amp;amp; strict Asian parents with exceedingly high expectations. 

But, if someone can change their gender or decide (?) that they identify as a different gender without having the prior lived experience of said gender, then why can't someone identify as a different race?

I'm not able to encompass all the variables which could lead someone to identify as another gender, but is it not possible for someone to come to the same conclusion with their race? What if an Indian man grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood, saw or experienced the same (or similar) discrimination as them, had minimal exposure to Indian culture; and this led him to conclude that he identifies more closely as a black man, rather than Indian? 

I would also like to cite Rachel Dolezal, who was uniformly mocked for being (afaik) the first trans-black woman in the public eye. It seems similar to transgender discrimination to me, assuming that there is something wrong with her mentally for deciding to become a black woman... Anyway, I'm not really defending her because that's not really in line with what I described in the previous paragraph (she grew up privileged IIRC), but the public reaction of mockery goes against the leftist belief of acceptance, by my perspective.

So, in short, why can there be no such thing as trans-racial people, the same way there are transgender?

    <text>Don't change your mind on this. You're 100% right. There are biological differences between genders that go down to the chromosomal level. There are men, and then there are women, end of story. What makes a man a man is the presence of the SRY- gene typically located on the Y-chromosome (sometimes you can have crossover events during Meiosis I that relocate the SRY-gene on the X-chromosome, but this can only happen in spermatogenesis). This gene transcribes mRNA, which is then used to translate proteins at the ribosomes of cells that are used to differentiate cells into specific functions. These cells constitute tissues that make up organs. There are specific and discrete male and female organs made up of different cells and different tissues. There is ostensible sexual dimorphism between men and women, which any sort of surgery or treatment cannot rectify.

All of the above mentioned facts are present throughout all races of human beings. There are few differences between races, most of which involve insignificant factors like melanin production (skin color) and some bone shape. 

There are two social constructs at play here:

1) What a male and what a female looks like. We have an idea of what men and women look like, but if they resemble the other sex based on societal ideas of what a man looks like and what a female looks like, then that does not make them a man or a woman respectively. They are still biologically one or the other unless they have very rare genetic disorders that make them something in between; these are exceptions to the rule, but the rule still stands. 

2) The only societal construct between races are racist ideas that one race is superior to another; this is obviously nonsense, and it's frankly disgusting that someone would think this way. There is no difference between people of different skin color much like there isn't any difference between people of different heights, hair color, or eye color. The only difference is that the specific genes for people of different races means that their skin cells produce a different amount of pigment than others, and other minor differences of the like. There are, however, genomic differences between men and women, namely the chromosomal makeup of men and women.

Anyone who tries to tell you otherwise is either ignorant or lying. There are differences between genders, and sexual dimorphism is a real thing.</text>
