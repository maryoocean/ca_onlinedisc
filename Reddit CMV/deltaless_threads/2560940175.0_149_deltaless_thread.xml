    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

Where do we find "official" adjectives?

Also, it's only "American" in English; there are different words in other languages that are more like "United States-ian," because America is the continent, not a country.

It harms other people because it ignores them and the fact that they are Americans too because they live on North and South America. 

It's tied to "American arrogance" and Imperialism in that we name ourselves after the entire continent, regardless of who else is on it.</text>
