    <title>CMV: Hillary Clinton is unfit for presidency.</title>
    <original_poster>Professorjack88</original_poster>
    <original_post>I believe that Hillary Clinton is unfit for the presidency because she is corrupt, a liar, and a hypocrite.

1. Hillary Clinton is corrupt. She or her husband routinely [have taken money from companies](http://downtrend.com/robertgehl/oops-bill-clinton-says-he-accidentally-took-500000-from-algeria-during-key-arms-negotiation-with-state-department), that they then go on to give government contracts. [One of her largest donors was given a spot on the nuclear advisory board, with no experience at all.](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/clinton-had-donor-as-nuclear-security-adviser.html) She will not release her speech transcripts, which hints at the fact that Hillary may have told them something that she doesn't want to get out. Whether it be corruption or something else; she is hiding something.



2. Hillary Clinton is a hypocrite and a liar. She takes huge sums of cash from wall street, and then says that she is going to breakup the banks. She says that she is a women's rights activist, and yet takes millions from countries like Saudi Arabia. I haven't even mentioned Hillary's flip flopping on all sorts of her campaign issues, and described in [this](http://imgur.com/Ls3B6n1) image. You can see her whole platform change in response to Bernie Sanders. She seems to say anything to get elected.

Based on all this, how can people support her? The facts are right there, and yet Hillary continues to get many votes. Is there something that I'm missing? It seems as if the second she gets in office she will support the big donors that she has pledged against. Throughout this whole thing, I haven't yet talked about Hillary's email scandal. She held secret government files on a server that was *hacked multiple times.* If someone could show me the reasons to support Hillary that would be great.

    <text>You haven't shown that she is any worse than any other politician. </text>

    <text>Just because everyone does it doesn't make it OK, imo.</text>

    <text>It doesn't.

but saying "so and so" is unfit, singling her out is innappropriate then. 

It is ridiculous saying Clinton is corrupt with Trump in the race.</text>

    <text>So who does meet your standard?  If you're setting the bar so high that no modern presidents are acceptable, then it's pretty hard to change your view.  At that point, your submission should read more like "CMV: We have not had a president fit to hold the office since _____."</text>

You make me realize that we can't hold presidents to a gold standard and we should take what we can get. </text>

    <text>Yeah, that's the sad reality. I want a drastically different system than what we have, but I know I'll never live to see it. Best I can hope for is helping set the groundwork for long-term change. Or at least that's what I tell myself. </text>

    <text>And what is your solution? You need to have a president, and whoever you pick is going to be as bad as every other politician. If she's just as bad as everyone else there's no need to single her out for it.</text>
