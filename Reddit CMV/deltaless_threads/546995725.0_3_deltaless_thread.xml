    <title>CMV: "-but president Pense!" is not a good argument against impeachment.</title>
    <original_poster>Dr_Scientist_</original_poster>
    <original_post>This post assumes that Donald Trump has been found guilty of committing an impeachable offense. **A standard which hasn't been reached**. This is a purely hypothetical universe, different from our own, one in which Trump is conclusively guilty of committing crimes which would normally eject a person from being the president. 

I only bring this up because I often see people bemoaning, 'Oh but then *Pense* would be president' as if that would not be a dramatic upgrade from a convicted criminal. Pense seems to have no spine, abhorrent views, and his tenure as vice-president seriously undermines his credibility as a moral thinking person. His willingness to fly out to a football game, *just to leave it*, is hardly better than a humping lapdog. I don't think he belongs anywhere near the office.

However Trump has proven himself to be so disastrous, it seems inconceivable to me that Pense could be worse. It just doesn't seem plausible that Pense would surround himself family members as top advisers, pull dumbass stunts like a travel-ban without consulting legal council, resort to playground bullying like trying to illegally withhold federal dollars from sanctuary cities, get himself caught up in some Russian scandal, or some pornstar scandal, golf at his own resort every weekend, suggest doing away with due process, start a trade war, make asinine tweets threatening world war at 3am, fight illegal immigration with baby cages, or open his administration to the likes of Scott Pruitt and the whole goddamn swamp of lowlifes Trump has brought with him.

I totally get that he would likely appoint ultra-conservative supreme court picks, push back LGBT rights to the stone age, and may have chosen to abandon the Paris Accord /  Iran Nuclear deal all on his own. Again, he's not someone I would vote for. 

**BUT** *if* Trump ever were on the verge of being impeached, "-but what about Pense????" is not a good argument for tolerating a known criminal in office. 

This is something I feel pretty strongly about but whenever I try talk about it, I don't feel like I get much/any support for my view. 'Oh but what about Pense' is something I hear often from people whose opinions I respect. **Is there something to that argument?** Should I be more concerned about Pense maybe being a bad president if it's known that Trump already is one?

    <text>In terms of actual policy and results the Trump administration hasn’t been disastrous. Sure, there’s some new big story every other day where Trump opened his fat mouth and said something remarkably unpresidential, if not stupid, but the economy’s doing well (not to say that’s Trump’s doing), and our foreign policy position can’t be said to be significantly worse than it was under Bush or Obama. In short, Trump hasn’t absolutely fucked everything up yet. 

Now, I don’t know about your experience, but I’ve personally mostly seen the “but Pence tho” argument being used against leftists who want Trump impeached not because he might have committed any high crimes, but because they just hate the man and his policies. And in that context, the “Pence” argument is a good one. If what you care about is not having a criminal in the White House, then Pence is an infinitely better President than the hypothetically-guilty Trump. But if what you care about is not having a right-winger in the White House, then sorry, you’d have to go pretty far down the line of succession to get that. 

tl;dr: you’re technically correct, but I think you’re accidentally strawmanning this argument </text>

Possible. It's definitely true that I'm not presenting a version of Trump which is anything more than an intoxicated mental patient. 

I have heard this 'but Pense' from people on the left as if it wouldn't fix anything, but I guess I see not having a criminal as president as fixing quite a bit.   </text>
