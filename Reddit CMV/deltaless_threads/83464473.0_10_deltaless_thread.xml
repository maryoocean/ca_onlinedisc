    <original_post>Prayer as an act of reaching to a deity for help or comfort has no appreciable effect beyond what can be achieved by normal positive thinking.

Praying to end world hunger or to get a job has no effect unless you or someone else makes the decision to achieve the goal. These goals could also just as easily be achieved without prayer.

Edit: I do not believe in the non corporeal nature of prayer. I do believe in the effects such as positive thinking giving someone a better understanding of who they are a what they can do.</original_post>

    <text>Others have already covered the fact that prayer can be used for the placebo effect, to 'trick yourself' into positive thinking. The thing, though, is that positive thinking can only affect yourself. Well, to some extent a good mood affects people around you as well, but that is not my point.

Imagine if there were a god that could change what people thinks, or affect their decisions. If this were true, and that god actually listened to people's prayers, then those prayers could be used to change someone else's point of view. My prayers to end world hunger could make that god inspire other people to donate more money to the poor, or even do something themselves (like starting to work for helping organizations).

Yes, the theory assumes that there is a god that can do these things, but if you didn't think there were a god, you would probably not pray in the first place.</text>
