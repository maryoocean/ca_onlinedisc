    <title>cmv: There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as an “American”</title>

    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>Americans probably won’t understand why this triggers a lot of people: People from all of North or South America can also refer to themselves as Americans, which they absolutely are (Canada, Mexico, Panama, Colombia, etc.) * If * you want a new term, call yourself un estadounidense. It means from the United States. 🤍</text>

    <text>I understand that other countries have different continents I just think it’s silly if it “triggers” anybody. In the US people call the continent “North America” or “South America” so it isn’t confusing if someone says they are American because if they were trying to say they were from North America they would call themselves “North Americans.” I think it’s weird to say another country should change its language because it doesn’t fit other countries languages or culture. And the term you suggested is not English so it would be not just switching a term that all Americans are familiar with, but also switching it to a language the majority of Americans aren’t familiar with. It just feels like a lot of work to fix a small semantic problem.</text>

    <text>Oh this was merely a suggestion, people should do what they want. I just wanted to provide extra context and a term since there really wasn’t an English alternative</text>
