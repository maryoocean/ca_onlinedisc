    <title>CMV: It makes sense that police would be more violent on average than other people because the job naturally appeals to control freaks.</title>

    <original_post>(Disclaimer:This isn't an ACAB post. I think many cops are good people doing a job that society needs, and I'm not here to say that every cop is bad  or violent or that we should abolish police.)

A study in the 90s found that about 40% of cops were reported for domestic violence as opposed to 10% of the general population. I know that study is outdated, and may not be entirely accurate, but it makes sense that cops would be more violent on average than regular people because the job naturally appeals to control freaks.

The job largely entails enforcing rules, giving people orders that they have to obey, and physically coercing them if they don't comply. Even if the cop's order is unlawful, you're generally advised to obey anyway and take it to court later. If someone is naturally power-hungry, this is the kind of job that would appeal to them.

Again, I'm not saying every cop is bad or violent. I think their job is necessary and I think a lot of cops are good people, but the job itself  attracts control freaks.</original_post>

    <text>I don't necessarily reject your reasoning about the personality types which would be attracted to those types of jobs. Generally speaking, it takes a certain type of person to do an intrinsically dangerous job, not to mention personality traits like *Orderliness* contributing to an affinity for rigid, orderly environments and professions. 

However, one of the reasons those studies are always called into question is because the direction and mechanism of causality is dubious. 

Is it that cops and military are more prone to domestic violence? Or, is it that the nature of their job and higher rates of mental illness such as anxiety and PTSD lead to higher rates of social malfunction? That is to say, it could be the dysfunctional working environment and not the innate personality causing the antisocial behavior. 

So, perhaps your basic premise is preliminarily correct, but it ignores too many relevant variables to be considered a practically useful summary of the phenomenon.</text>
