    <title>CMV: The notion that the Democrats or Republicans "must" run Biden or Trump "because there are no other viable candidates" is ridiculous. There are thousands of people who would make better presidential candidates for 2024 than Biden or Trump.</title>

    <original_post>Every argument for Biden or Trump to run in 2024 boils down to some version of "status quo" or "inertia." We're told that the Ds and Rs have no choice but to run these super-old candidates because there's nobody else who could be suitable.

&amp;#x200B;

In a nation of 332,000,000 people, there are well over 100 million who are over the age of 35, American-born, and have resided in the United States for 14 years or more - in other words, are constitutionally eligible to run for president.

Out of those 100 million, surely at least half have a basic education, are mature, sensible, decent people, and have demonstrated solid character - and also be significantly younger than Trump or Biden.

Out of those 50 million, surely at least ten million would qualify as *highly* educated - the metrics of which can be tricky to figure out (is it a master's degree? or something else?) - but they would be significantly above average.

Out of those 10 million, surely at least one million would be quite exceptional - people who have substantially high IQ, have advanced quite far in life and a career - such as being a doctor, or having worked in public governmental service for decades, etc.

And out of those million, surely at least 10,000 would have the political know-how, the charisma, the political interest, maybe have spent significant time abroad in foreign countries or speak multiple languages, to be a suitable president.

In fact, even in Congress, state legislatures or governorships alone, there must be dozens of good, qualified, educated, experienced politicians who would be much younger than Trump or Biden, and who would make suitable presidential candidates. 

So, CMV on this one. I don't buy for one moment the notion that, in a nation of 332 million people, America somehow has no choice but to run Biden vs. Trump in 2024 because "we've got no one else who'd be a good candidate."  </original_post>

    <text>At this point in American politics and history, "viable" doesn't mean "objectively suited to do the job the best way for the most people", it means a heady and fucked up combination of "the most attractive to big-money investors who will fund their campaign, the most palatable to the already-extant career politicians who will throw soft and hard power into supporting someone they think they can benefit from working alongside, the most polarizing/magnetizing/hype-generating (good or bad) to attract people who otherwise wouldn't care enough about voting for various reasons to do so".  


On paper you're right, and the math all adds up to that. But the career politicians and politically-involved private donors and committees don't do the same math as us. They don't, for various reasons, follow what it says on paper. So we pick the least-harmful out of the ones that are most likely to gain enough traction to have a chance at winning, and use the breathing room to try to push the weight of American politics into a little better position over the next four years.</text>
