    <title>CMV: Modern marriage in the US brings more harm than benefit for men.</title>
    <original_poster>cannibalstreudel</original_poster>
    <original_post>I believe based on marriage laws and divorce practices that marriage no longer has more benefits than harm for men.

For women it's the opposite. I believe this because whether laws state this or not, practices in divorce court often grant kids' custody to the mother from the father when they aren't more dangerous to their kids than their wife. And often men have to give up half their income/assets in divorce when they often make most of the income of the household.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Sure there are emotional benefits to a long term relationship. But there aren't extra benefits for men on top of an emotionally committed relationship that exclusively comes with marriate.

The security marriage itself brings is only for the woman. She gets to enjoy financial guarantee of sharing income when men often make more than women, and she can be assured of his fidelity - it's backed up by government enforcement... women rarely are punished for fucking another guy and being impregnated at the level men are, and often the man in the marriage gets cucked and is made responsible for raising another man's child.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Men are bringing unnecessary vulnerabilities on themselves when they marry a woman in modern US courts.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

If someone can reliably demonstrate that marriage gives more potential benefit to men than potential harm, I would believe marriage brings more benefit than harm to men. And to be clear, I'm not talking about long term relationships, I'm talking about specifically signing a marriage document and putting the law behind the union.</original_post>

    <text>Marriage is not a monolithic, one-size-fits-all concept. It depends on who you're married to. 

The benefit my marriage brings me is immeasurable. The partnership I have with my wife is my life's greatest source of joy. </text>

    <text>I'm sure you love her and you provide support and awesomeness to each other. My argument is that you can have the same benefit from commitment between you two and you don't have to bring marriage into the equation to get those benefits.</text>

    <text>Marriage is a legal commitment that merges us into a single family unit. Brings a lot of benefits into our partnership. </text>

    <text>Joint ownership of various accounts, tax benefits, insurance benefits, etc.

Not to mention social benefits. Married couples are taken more seriously and held to a higher degree of respect than regular couples. Backed by thousands of years of tradition. </text>

    <text>More recently though the risks men take are far greater than they have been and I believe they outweigh these benefits.</text>
