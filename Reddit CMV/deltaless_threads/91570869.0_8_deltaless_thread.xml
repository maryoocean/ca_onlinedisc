    <title>CMV: Why isn't Wonder Woman sexist?</title>
    <original_poster>BottomOfTheNinth</original_poster>
    <original_post>Most of what I hear and see about Wonder Woman leads me to believe she's sexist. In the depictions I've seen of her she comes from a society that banished men, she seems to be surprised when men are good (and on the opposite side of things, surprised when women are evil) and generally can't go five minutes without calling men dicks because her dad was an asshole.

To clarify, this isn't some men's rights post. I don't care on some kind of personal level if she is or isn't sexist, I just kind of want it clarified for me because a lot of people say she isn't sexist - yet in the examples I've seen of her (the Justice League cartoon, the animated Wonder Woman film, the Flashpoint comic book series...) she pretty much just hates men in general. A lot of people have also told me that while Wonder Woman herself isn't sexist, the Amazons are, so I could kind of do with that being explained too.</original_post>

    <text>The DC nu52 iteration of Wonder Woman (current continuity) is sexist. Just read this [review](http://www.themarysue.com/wonder-woman-7/) of issue #7. 

Overall, this swing of the pendulum is not a bad thing. The comics industry consistently has problems with unintended sexism (just google nu52 Starfire or Catwoman). The current Wonder Woman turns that dynamic on its head. It hasn't become a self-parady; it is a refreshing break from the norms. 


On a different sexism note, if any character should be written/drawn by female talent; it would be Diana. </text>

    <text>It's so moronic to call the current run sexist, especially in light of the fact that the Amazons were nothing more than a masturbatory fantasy for girl-worshipping nerds till now.</text>

    <text>So raping sailors that pass by the island... not sexist?

So killing all male offspring... not sexist?

So changing your mind on killing all male offspring and instead selling them into demonic slavery... not sexist?

This all is depicted in issue 7. My point was that the Wonder Woman title has turned the traditional comic sexism on its head and I went further to say it was refreshing. 

Still, denying it is sexist in its current form is just dumb. </text>

    <text>Sorry if my comment was snippy, I love the current run, and it bothers me to no end when I see this complaint. Granted, I have to do a reread of the issue, but what I remember to call what the Amazons do rape is an overstatement.

And Male Amazons aren't in demonic slavery. They were given to a God who granted them a life of humble craftsmanship. Hephaestus isn't profiting of their work. They were outcasts, like he is with Olympians. The Amazons showing mercy for their children and letting them live is not sexist.</text>

    <text>The male babies were given to a demi-god in exchange for weapons. The male babies were sold for weapons. How is that not slavery?</text>

    <text>The Amazons are profiting by the weapons, not Hephaestus. He doesn't treat them sub-humanly, and is the entire reason they are alive. Nothing about their situation resembles slavery. They aren't in bondage, hence Wonder Woman's massive failure when she attempted to "save" them.</text>

    <text>Huh. Interesting. I seem to remember seeing an image a few days ago in relation to Wonder Woman essentially beating one of her male allies for no other reason than the fact that he disagreed with her on something, so I suppose this would reinforce that.

On a semi-related sidenote, it would appear a couple of people who have answered seem to be a little angry about that fact I assume she's sexist. As I specified, I'm not angry that she might be a sexist character - quite the opposite in fact. This sexist Wonder Woman in the nu52 is a very interesting take on the character. I don't support sexism, but when a character in a story is sexist it might open up the opportunity to explore sexist storylines. A lot of people seem to be fine with watching films and tv series that have serial killers as the main characters, yet they'd never support a serial killer in the real world. I see no difference between reading a series about a sexist character and a murderer. Both offer opportunities for interesting stories.</text>
