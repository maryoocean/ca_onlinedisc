    <original_post>I'll preface the statement by saying that from a completely ideological perspective, I understand that Islam is experiencing the same thing Christianity experienced in the Middle Ages. Additionally, I do not think that Islam is an inherently bad institution, I jus believe that it's a driving force for far too many problems. Every week, we here about honor killings and suicide bombings. With the recent mall takeover in Kenya, I simply can no longer believe that Islam is a positive institution. I would like to believe that Islam can be a positive institution, but ultimately it's a net negative on society and the world would be a happier, safer place without it.</original_post>

    <text>Just imagine, few hundred years ago a muslim guy probably said:

'Islam is fine but the modern world would be a better place without Christianity'

Do you agree with him? </text>
