    <title>CMV: all (US) roads that are not highways between cities or states should only have a single, one-way, lane of civilian traffic or less.</title>

    <original_post>The main reasoning for my argument is because there at this point has been consistent, replicated, research finding that the more roads you add, the more traffic is actually _increased._ It would be a rough transition at first, but in theory, traffic would be diminished if you cut down the number of roads and the number of lanes. This would be great for the environment but it also would be great for everyone driving because there would be less traffic. The lanes that are no longer in use could be used to improve our society in a number of ways. They could be made into trees or park area. They could be restricted to only delivery vehicles and/or public transit or emergency vehicles. Or they could be made into bike paths. And if all goes well, perhaps people would even be open to eliminating some roads for civilian traffic all together.

Edit: Again, to reiterate, according to all the current research, more roads actually _create_ more traffic. So if anything, this would reduce traffic, maybe not immediately, but over time. A lot of people seem to not have read that part, so I'm not going to respond to repeats of people who clearly did not read my argument.

    <text>Your definition of civilian aside, are you then suggesting one lane for non-freight and one lane for freight? What about entrance and exit lanes? And how would freight enter and exit without crossing into the non-freight lane, or vice versa? Would the two lane types have separate entrances and exits? If so, that would increase the number of non-highway lanes and interchange complexity. Why not reduce the number of non-freight lanes to zero and increase inter-city high speed rail lines?</text>

    <text>What is going on here is a chicken and egg situation. The OP is misunderstanding how induced demand works. You can reduce roads and reduce traffic simultaneously. But, this can only be done AFTER a robust public transit and associated system (bicycle and walking) has been established.</text>
