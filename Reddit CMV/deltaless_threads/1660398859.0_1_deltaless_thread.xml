    <title>CMV: Web 3.0 is just a Zoomer's realization that "Punk" was a subculture that existed before they did.</title>

    <original_post>All Web 3.0 is a call to decentralize the digital ecosystems that were built in Web 2.0. Instead of using Google and Facebook, users will create their own digital ecosystems. Hmm sounds a lot like the punk subculture that rejected postmodernism and consumerism in the 80s and 90s. 

Don't buy CD's. Make your own vinyl records! Don't buy music. Make your own music! Don't buy food. Grow your own food! I swear, Bill Maher is right when he accuses Zoomers of being the generation that thinks nobody ever lived before they did. 

Web 3.0 is just catchy nonsense that explains how YOU CAN TOO build your own digital ecosystem away from the prying eyes and centralized control of BIG TECH. Well, sure, you could do that. IF you were a programmer that was so inclined AND had a lot of disposal income to build your own digital ecosystems. There's a reason why Google and Facebook exist and most people use them: because they can't or don't want to create their own products all the time. 

Web 3.0 just seems to be a scammy premise that promises that people can "decentralize" the internet and own their own data and blah blah blah. That's not how it works. You're never going to "own" your personal data unless you essentially become a digital version of an Amish person who never uses the internet unless it's in their own homemade ecosystem. 

Also, as more and more actors move into the space to create their own ecosystems disconnected from "big tech", there will be a power law distribution on who consolidates power and influence with those new ecosystems. In effect, you're trading Google or Facebook for another 3rd party...a 3rd party which will STILL have centralized control over your data and use of their system as a customer. And no, blockchain (which is just a lame version of SQL) isn't going to solve for this. There will always be a party that acts as a controller for the data and systems that make up the ecosystem. Doesn't matter if it's Google, Facebook, or your whatever new Web 3.0 platform becomes the next player.

Again, this all just sounds like the Punk subculture that advocated a DIY ethos. Tell me the difference between the punk subculture and the Zoomer's wet dream of a "decentralized internet" a la "Web 3.0".

Go ahead and change my view but please spare me any lofty generalized nonsense about how Web 3.0 will cure cancer and save the whales.</original_post>

This is a gem. Every generation re-creates things from previous generations and thinks it's invented it.

Every generation looks at "the kids these days" and thinks they're entitled, rude, and listless</text>
