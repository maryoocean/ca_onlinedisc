    <title>CMV: I believe that cannabis is an objectively better substance for recreational use than alcohol</title>
    <original_poster>ProjectGO</original_poster>
    <original_post>*(Note: I will be using the term cannabis instead of marijuana, weed, or pot, since that is the proper name for the plant and does not carry slang or propaganda connotations like the other common terms do. Also, for the purposes of the CMV cannabis consumption refers to the inhalation of smoke from burning cannabis buds, as opposed to more exotic methods of consumption.)*

As an adult of legal age in Washington state, I am allowed to purchase cannabis from a government-licensed store and consume it in my own house. For the purpose of this CMV, let's assume others have similar rights such that legality is not a concern.

The known effect (and implicit goal) of drinking alcohol or smoking cannabis is to temporarily alter the brain's chemistry to produce enjoyable sensations. By almost every metric I can think of, cannabis is a superior substance to use to achieve this goal.

* **Safety:** Alcohol poisoning, alcohol related organ failures, and intoxicated accidents kill hundreds of thousands of people a year. Very drunk people are known to become violent, emotional, and dangerous to themselves and others. Cannabis's effects are caused by THC, which is very nontoxic to ingest. The amount of THC required to overdose and die from cannabis use is literally impossible to consume quickly enough to maintain a fatal saturation. Studies have shown that [cannabis use does not lead to more driving accidents](http://norml.org/library/item/marijuana-and-driving-a-review-of-the-scientific-evidence) and the most common effect of driving high in simulator tests is reduced speed. (Still, don't drive impaired, regardless of what you're using). I can only speak from anecdotal evidence, but I have never seen cannabis cause an aggressive or violent reaction in the user.

* **Controlled intoxication:** Consuming alcohol with a specific level of intoxication in mind (other than blackout drunk) is a challenging task. Variations in drink strength and methods of consumption can make it harder to judge one's level of intoxication, and the timing and order of consumption plays a significant role in how the alcohol affects the body and how enjoyable the experience is. The duration of alcohol intoxication is usually many hours, which generally means that by consuming alcohol the drinker has implicitly accepted that they will not be safely able to do certain tasks or make certain decisions for the remainder of the day/night. Cannabis, especially state regulated cannabis, comes with detailed information regarding THC content and the heredity of the specific plant being consumed. This allows the user to tailor their cannabis experience to achieve or avoid specific effects, and with some planning (although no more than counting your drinks) accurately control the length and intensity of their cannabis intoxication. The duration of intoxication from smoking cannabis is typically shorter than that of consuming alcohol, and leaves the user capable of functioning normally with few ill effect after use.

* **Effects:** Alcohol generally lowers the inhibitions, impairs the judgement, and increases the volume of the person consuming it. Heavy consumption can lead to loss of motor control, disorientation, blackouts, and alcohol poisoning. The effects of cannabis depend largely on the genetics of the plant in question, and can be carefully tailored by growers to induce a specific intoxicating effect. Plants from the species *Cannabis Indica* tend to cause feelings of calm, drowsiness, and relaxation. Plants from the species *Cannabis Sativa* tend to cause uplifting, energetic, or cerebral effects. Excessive consumption of cannabis may lead to dizziness, paranoia, or 'couch-lock', but there are no chemically harmful effects (such as alcohol poisoning).

* **Aftermath:** Hangovers suck. Waking up and feeling like you just want to trow up and die is no fun at all. Cannabis has negligible aftereffects, and (anecdotally again) cannabis use after heavy alcohol consumption significantly reduces the pain of the next morning's hangover. Alcohol and alcohol byproducts remain in the body for 1-2 days at most after intoxicating effects have ceased. Cannabis byproducts remain in the bloodstream and urine for 2-6 weeks depending on frequency of use and body type, and can be detected in hair samples far beyond that.

* **Price:** In Washington, lower-end state-regulated liquor sells for around $35 per 1.75 liters. This converts to about $1 per shot, which is on par with roughly $1 a beer when buying from a grocery store. Assuming consumption of 6 drinks in a night, the at-home cost is $6. At a bar, event, or stadium, drink prices are significantly more expensive, and 6 drinks (including tips) can quickly surpass $50. At current prices (which are expected to fall as supply and demand balance out) you can purchase 2 grams of high-potency cannabis from a regulated store for $60. Calculating an equivalent scale of grams of cannabis per drink is a difficult task, but by my math (2g can make 4 0.5g bowls which can each get 3 people to the equivalent intoxication of 5 drinks) it still comes out to roughly $1 per drink equivalent. Bulk cannabis from a medical co-op is much less expensive ($250 per oz = 28g), and lowers the price to $0.30 per drink equivalent.

* **Social acceptance:** Alcohol wins this one hands down. In adulthood, someone who doesn't consume alcohol occasionally is considered the exception rather than the norm. Cannabis is still widely seen in the connotations of "dope for hippies and stoners", and cannabis use is not considered a suitable topic for discussion the way alcohol use is. Much of modern nightlife is centered around going out and consuming alcohol socially, and there is no equivalent cannabis culture yet. For younger audiences there are a wide range of drinking games played socially with alcohol, but few (if any) social games revolving around cannabis consumption.

In short, I believe that cannabis is objectively superior to alcohol in terms of achieving a state of recreational intoxication. By the metrics I have stated, I feel that cannabis is the superior substance in all cases except social acceptance, and that is a nebulous metric that is subject to change and unrelated to the effects that either substance has on the user. 

The best way to CMV would be to point out one or more metrics I have not considered where alcohol is preferable to cannabis, or show that my logic in assessing the metrics I have used is incorrect. The goal of this CMV is not to start an argument between 'stoners' and 'teetotalers', but rather to objectively compare two intoxicating substances on their merits and drawbacks.

**TL;DR:** All things considered, I'd rather get intoxicated on cannabis than on alcohol.

    <text>&amp;gt;**Safety**

Totally agree with you. Cannabis is objectively safer.

&amp;gt;**Controlled intoxication**

Totally disagree, so much so that I am not sure how you got this backwards. Alcohol comes with %abv on the bottle (at least here in Canada it does, maybe you still use "proof" but it comes with a value). They may be different in different countries, but there is such a thing as a [standard drink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_drink). On the other hand, how many cannabis users use a scale accurate to less than 0.5g to measure every bong rip? Do you measure the mass of every joint? I have never met anyone who did that.

&amp;gt;**Effects**

Your logic is most flawed here. You want "objectively better" but preferred effects are a subjective matter. I used to smoke cannabis, but now I dislike the effect. I used to refrain from any drinking, but now I like the effects when consumed at mild and moderate doses. For me, cannabis is subjectively worse than alcohol, so much so that it outweighs all other consideration because I dislike it. If someone gave me cannabis for free I would not smoke it because I do not like the effect. I want to make this the clear point: **this is the death of your idea: you want "objective" but substance use is necessarily subjective**

&amp;gt;**Aftermath**

On the whole I agree most of the time. There have been occasions where I have had cannabis "hangovers" where I felt very strange for days afterward, though. Alcohol hangovers feel worse, but they have only ever lasted a day for me. Still, I would rather have the cannabis hangover than the alcohol one, personally.

&amp;gt;**Price**

The prices are different in the USA than here in Canada... our (black market) cannabis prices are *way* lower and our government-regulated liquor prices are *way* higher. Price per "intoxication unit" I agree, cannabis is objectively less expensive.

&amp;gt;**Social acceptance**

Here in Ontario, Canada the two substances have pretty equivalent acceptance, depending on one's particular social crowd. There is much less stigma here.

&amp;gt;show that my logic in assessing the metrics I have used is incorrect

The main flaw in your logic is that objective qualities only matter *after* subjective qualities come into play in this circumstance. Cannabis is cheaper and safer, but if someone does not enjoy the feeling of the cannabis high, it is not "objectively" better. For me, cannabis is subjectively worse.</text>

    <text>In response to your response to the controlled intoxication section: In theory a person consuming alcohol has the ability to measure out exactly how much they plan on consuming, and do so accordingly. However, being the fact that it impairs judgement and many thinking skills like math, it becomes quite difficult. Add that with the fact that I have never heard of someone pre-allocating all alcohol they plan on consuming, and rather makes the decision to have another drink after judging how drunk they currently are. Furthermore, the social environment college students in particular experience, there are many times people choose to injest a drink that they don't know if it has half a standard drink or 4 standard drinks in it.

Now on the cannabis side of things, you are wrong about the accuracy of scales, I haven't even heard of a modern electric scale that has an inaccuracy greater than 0.01 grams. However one thing I have learned from being a cannabis user is you get a really really really good feeling of the potency of your particular strain of cannabis after one or two hits, allowing you to easily gauge how much you injest because you are personally rolling the joint or packing the bowl or trench.

Wow, I just thought of even another factor in which control is harder for alcohol and easier for cannabis: rate of consumption. How quickly you drink alcohol is a big factor in how intoxicated you become, and after seeing the multitude of drinking games out there, people can consume it pretty fast. With cannabis, however, you can't "pound joints" in the same way you can pound shots, because the longer you keep a single hit in your lungs, the more intoxicated you become, forcing you to slow down if you want to not waste THC leaving in the smoke/vapor you exhale. The only exception to this would be edibles, but a person who doesn't exercise extreme caution with edibles deserves to lose control of their intoxication, those things can be very potent.</text>

    <text>It's all very well accurately measuring the cannabis you put into your joints, but due to prohibition in most parts of the world, it is impossible to know the strength or cannabinoid composition. It's easy to gauge the potency by smoking it, but by this time it's too late. Some types of cannabis will produce unpleasant effects in me after one toke.

Your last point is also pretty ridiculous. THC is absorbed pretty quickly in the lungs. Holding your breath increases the feeling of intoxication but only due to oxygen deprivation. If you're holding hits in your lungs you're just allowing more time for tar to condense. It is *definitely* possible to "pound joints" in the same way that you pound shots, and I've seen it done.</text>

What? Are you saying you have no clue how potent a batch of cannabis is until you have smoked all of it? Unless you plan on smoking your whole quarter in the short amount of time it takes for you to start feeling the effects of the first hit (I don't even think that's possible), then of course you can judge how potent it is. For me, I'd say 1/4th to half way through my first smoke/vape session with a new strain, I can accurately tell how altered I will get given how much I continue ingesting.</text>

    <text>So you can essentially tell how high you are getting while you're smoking? That's interesting I have never heard of that.</text>

  <comment id="27424071584.0" user="celticguy08" delta="False">
    <text>Really? It's pretty simple if you just take a moment to assess how altered you are. I find being high at low to medium levels presents itself primarily in a certain type of feeling that I don't quite know how to describe, almost like a rhythm that increases in amplitude as you get more high. It is the primary reason why I find I get to just the point I want before I stop, because every step I think about how much I want at that point.</text>

Your arguments above are exactly as relevant for cannabis. People do not pre-measure, it impairs judgement, and the social environment of younger people can encourage over-indulgence. It also falls short for alcohol in some cased, but not for cannabis: beer bottles are an example of pre-measured alcohol. In bars (at least in Canada) the bartender uses a jigger to measure alcohol.

&amp;gt;Now on the cannabis side of things, you are wrong about the accuracy of scales, I haven't even heard of a modern electric scale that has an inaccuracy greater than 0.01 grams.

You missed the point, which was not about the accuracy of scales but instead about the use of scales. Like I said, no-one I have ever known measures every bong rip. You are also incorrect about scales: I have a scale that measures at 0.1g, not 0.01g, and I have a kitchen scale that measures at only 1g accuracy. Furthermore, not every cannabis user even has a scale at all; I got mine for measuring magic-mushrooms.

&amp;gt;However one thing I have learned from being a cannabis user is you get a really really really good feeling of the potency of your particular strain of cannabis after one or two hits, allowing you to easily gauge how much you injest because you are personally rolling the joint or packing the bowl or trench.

This is perfectly transferable to alcohol. As an alcohol user, I am aware of how I will feel after 1oz of 40% liquor, and I understand the increments based on standard drinks. I do not even need to take a single sip because the %abv is written on the label and I poor my alcohol into a measured shot-glass before putting it into my drinking glass. Also, one cannot "easily gauge" cannabis when rolling a joint unless one is weighing it, and no-one is doing that; that is the point.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Standard Drinks: In the United States the standard drink contains 0.6 US fluid ounces (18 ml) of alcohol. This is approximately the amount of alcohol in a 12-US-fluid-ounce (350 ml) glass of 5% ABV beer, a 5-US-fluid-ounce (150 ml) glass of 12% ABV wine, or a 1.5-US-fluid-ounce (44 ml) glass of a 40% ABV (80 proof) spirit.

&amp;gt;With cannabis, however, you can't "pound joints" in the same way you can pound shots,

You can totally chain-smoke joints. You could also "pound" bong-rips. I have seen this done many times. Much fun was had **:P**

&amp;gt;because the longer you keep a single hit in your lungs, the more intoxicated you become, forcing you to slow down if you want to not waste THC leaving in the smoke/vapor you exhale.

You seem to lack an understanding of how THC is absorbed, as others have said. You are "getting higher" from oxygen deprivation if you are holding smoke for longer. Over 90% of the THC is absorbed within the first 3 seconds (Google it). You are just getting more tar condensate in your lungs from holding it longer.

&amp;gt;How quickly you drink alcohol is a big factor in how intoxicated you become, and after seeing the multitude of drinking games out there, people can consume it pretty fast. 

&amp;gt;The only exception to this would be edibles, but a person who doesn't exercise extreme caution with edibles deserves to lose control of their intoxication, those things can be very potent.

You did your own transfer right there. If people are drinking *to become wasted-drunk* then they can achieve that goal, likewise if they are ingesting cannabis to get [extremely high](https://i.imgur.com/AKrdc.png). Similarly, nn either case, a person can use the substance responsibly. In the case of alcohol, it is easier because the units are standardized and measured in the bottle. There is also only one intoxicant of interest: %abv. With cannabis, there is much more variety between strains with different levels of several psychoactive compounds. Cannabis is also an untreated agricultural product so there is more variance between buds from different plants of the same strain than there is between bottles of vodka from the same manufacturer.</text>

You seem to think you need to know how much mass of cannabis there is to know how high you will get, but just like alcohol, the active ingredient content varies from volume to volume and mass to mass, meaning the mass typically has little to do with how high you get. Instead, as an experienced smoker, you can see exactly what you are smoking. Is it a leafy part that wasn't quite trimmed correctly? You won't get that high. Is it the very tip of a large nug? You will get very high. Eyeballing solids is much easier than eyeballing liquids because you can see how much mass you are putting in compared to last time, and you use the first time smoking/vaping the cannabis as a benchmark for every future smoke with that much cannabis.</text>

  <comment id="27424611478.0" user="andero" delta="False">
    <text>&amp;gt; just like alcohol, the active ingredient content varies from volume to volume and mass to mass

This is categorically false. Vodka is a homogeneous liquid; the first shot is identical to the last shot in terms of alcohol content. A bottle of beer contains the marked amount of alcohol, and every bottle contains the amount marked on the label. There is essentially zero variance.

&amp;gt;Instead, as an experienced smoker, you can see exactly what you are smoking.

I am an experience smoker and while it is true that you can see what you are smoking, you cannot merely see THC content, CBD content, or any of the other psychoactive compounds and their relative concentrations in given sample of cannabis. Your sense of judging how high you might get is a lose and vague one, and you get approximately the right high after becoming experienced. With alcohol, there is numerical precision in every bottle that you just do not get when you are smoking cannabis.

I do not deny that you can develop a *feel* for it with both substances, but with alcohol you have numbers beside you and you can develop a feel by the number. With cannabis, you get a feel for a pinch of strain A nug-tip, which contains different amounts of active compounds than a pinch of strain A leaf, and you never measure what "a pinch" really is so it is variable every time, even more so the higher you get. Furthermore, this *feel* only partially transfers to different strains since they have different active compounds and ratios of compounds so "a pinch" of nug-tip of strain B gets you too high or not high enough. Much more playing around is needed to find your dose, which means much less "Controlled Intoxication", which is what OP was talking about and what I am talking about.</text>

    <text>&amp;gt; This is categorically false.

I don't think you understand, what I meant by it varies by volume is it depends on alcohol content between different types of drinks. Not between the same drink.

&amp;gt; develop a feel by the number. 

&amp;gt;  there is numerical precision in every bottle

However, there are a multitude of factors which effects how the body metabolizes the alcohol, like basic tolerance, how much you have eaten before-hand, etc. which is just enough to prevent you from having the precision to know exactly how much you will become intoxicated before having your first drink. Thus, it is just like cannabis, you have some, see how it affects you, and adjust your intended consumption accordingly. There is nothing wrong with that anyway.</text>

Then it is even less relevant because the variability between different strains of cannabis is far greater. As I said, cannabis varies in several psychoactive compounds, both in amounts and in ratios. When it comes to alcohol, there is only one active component, and that component is listed on the bottle.

In short, no-one is drinking a bottle of beer and mistaking it for a 350mL bottle of vodka, nor glass of wine.</text>

    <text>You are contradicting your first post. Also, your conclusion is irrelevant since it is after the fact; both substances impair judgement.

The point is that one can have a more accurate *prediction* and thereby a more "Controlled Intoxication" with alcohol because it is a homogeneous and measured product. Cannabis is more variable and people do not weigh their doses so there is nothing controlled about the intoxication.</text>
