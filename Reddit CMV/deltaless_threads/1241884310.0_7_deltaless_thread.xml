    <title>CMV: if you live in a “traditionally Christian” nation you should use Merry Christmas as the default greeting/goodbye unless you’re asked not to.</title>

    <original_post>Basically I think of it similar to misgendering people. In that context use the pronouns of the gender they appear to present as (unless you already know the person’s wishes). If and when someone asks you to use an alternate set, you apologise and change going forward. 

The same should be done with Christmas- in my experience almost nobody has any genuine objection to being told merry Christmas, hell, I was discussing just today with a woman in a full hijab our favourite (largely secular) aspects of Christmas, all the while referring to things as “Christmas XYZ”. However if someone tells me they’d prefer happy holidays then I’ll just switch. Just like pronouns it literally makes no difference to me. 

You can change my view by showing me that knowingly using words that will make someone else feel less welcome or upset is not worth it compared to the potential loss I might feel at using a different term. Of course maybe you can come up with other arguments I’ve not thought of.

Edit: this only applies “at this time of year” say more or less the month of December.</original_post>

Whether a nation is "traditionally Christian" is purely *descriptive*, not prescriptive or normative. It doesn't create any obligations on anyone in that nation whatsoever.

"Happy Holidays" is by definition more inclusive than just "Merry Christmas" - it covers Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, New Year etc. instead of only Christmas.

Also, you haven't considered "Happy Christmas", which is a variant that is more common in the UK and Ireland.</text>
