    <title>CMV: There is no reason to refuse to sign a pre-nup unless your reasons for marriage are corrupt to begin with.</title>
    <original_poster>dumbbuttloserface</original_poster>
    <original_post>I know that a lot of people view pre-nups as “insurance” in the case of divorce. And I get it. If someone is entering into a marriage with a LOT of capital, and the other person comes from significantly less, it makes sense to want to make sure that what’s yours, stays yours. 

But I think a lot of people (at least in media portrayals and stories from friends) are very against the idea of signing one and I don’t get it. If you love someone and you intend to be married to them forever, a pre-nup is essentially pointless. To me, it only seems like you would refuse to/be adverse to sign a pre-nup if you’re marrying someone because you see the relationship as potentially beneficial for you in the case of a divorce. 

I’m interested in hearing anyone’s opinion, but particularly the opinions of those who have been in this situation, i.e. the one asking for the pre-nup or the one being asked. Thank you!!

EDIT: I’ve awarded 3 deltas on this post so far because of some very valid points. The most convincing of which was that a prenup compels the person signing to be in a potentially extremely difficult and even dangerous position in the case of abuse. Someone else provided me with a very convincing analogy which put the whole issue in a new light for me. A third person suggested the possibility of an unfair prenup; I understand why you would not sign one, however, after re-negotiating the terms to a place where both parties can be satisfied with the prenup, it would then make no sense to continue to refuse to sign. And if the person asking for a prenup refuses to compromise on unfair terms, you probably shouldn’t be marrying them in the first place, imho. 

Ultimately, my personal experience has shaped my view so that I have no issue with signing a prenup with my partner, but I do see now that the issue is much more multi-faceted than I had previously believed. I suppose my view on the subject now is: there is no reason not to sign a prenup if the terms are satisfactory to both parties and there is room for a discussion between the couple. If your SO refuses to compromise on any point or even engage in a discussion about the terms, you probably shouldn’t be marrying them in the first place as they clear don’t see you as an equal. 

So I guess...view shifted/expanded, but not altogether changed. </original_post>

    <text>The life choices you would make if you knew you were in one financial circumstance are different then if you were in the other. In order to make the _same_ life choices in the marriage you may very well be sacrificing the earning potential of one of the individuals in favor of the marriage, or in favor of the earning potential of the partner.  If I make a decision to move to NY and my wife ultimately decides that is OUR decision, then she's just tanked her psychology practice in California.  That's an "in marriage" decision.  If the women knew that the financial life they were living was _not_ to be shared then she'd be needn't to forego the decision to move to NY and focus on her earning potential just in case they get divorced.  So...you would refuse because it forces one partner into a situation where they can't make "marriage first" decisions and still be taking good, long term, financial care of themselves.</text>

    <text>I understand what you’re saying, but I would like to think that in a marriage, the two people would discuss what is ultimately best for both partners and make a compromise based upon that. 

So in your example, moving to NY is best for you, but staying in CA is best for your wife. Which situation can ultimately be for the best? Do you already have relative success in CA and are just seeking a better opportunity? Is there a chance she could expand her practice and have a branch in NY and CA and spend time at each of the two? Could she get an equally (or semi equal) job in NY? I recognize that sometimes as a married couple one person will have to sacrifice for the other, but I think when you enter a marriage you automatically become a team and you hope to make a decision that can be beneficial or at the very least satisfactory for both parties. Maybe that’s naive and idealistic? I don’t know</text>

    <text>I absolutely agree that they should compromise and do whats best. That is _precisely_ the reason to not have the prenup.  

The point is that by putting out a pre-nup you're saying "let's compromise, but the financial cost of that compromise is going to be unevenly distributed in the event of divorce".  If compromise is going to be based on some set of anchors (wants, desires, hopes, dreams, ambitions, family, etc.) we add a truly funky anchor of "financial capacity" which one party will have to _compromise on_.  If you've had me sign a prenup and you want X and X puts me a rough spot individually from a financial perspective were we to get divorced then the prenup itself has been introduced as an anchor point of the "compromise".  I'd rather have the compromise be based on much better qualities then my now forced need to include my future potential need to support myself in the event of divorce.

This is essentially the idea, actually. But unfortunately, things don't always continue to work out, since approximately 50% of marriages end in divorce, "team" assets are divided when the team breaks up. </text>
