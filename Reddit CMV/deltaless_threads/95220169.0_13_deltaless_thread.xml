    <original_post>I believe that working 40 hours a week is entirely unnecessary for even (and perhaps especially for) technologically advanced first-world countries to thrive.  I feel that it isn't even possible for the majority of people to stay engaged for 8 or 9 hours a day, and that the 80/20 principle applies beautifully here (80 percent of work gets done during 20 percent of the time).

Our technological productivity has outpace our wants and needs to such a vast degree that it seems there are only to reasons justifying such a long work-week:

1-The economic machine needs people to be occupied so that they fall into the consumer mentality and fill up their few remaining hours with purchased items to entertain and fulfill themselves.  If people worked less, even if they were as productive, our economic growth would slow (which ecologically needs to happen, but I suppose can be seen as a negative).

2-Certain endeavors demand 40 hours or more a week.  Athletics, science, writing...but these are passion-based, rather than need-based.

I believe we could live happily in a world where everyone worked 20 hours each week.  CMV

edit: An awesome article that sums up my points much better than I can (thanks /u/WishingForBadThings)

As a phd student in science, I have to say that I find it impossible to concentrate fully on my work for more than 5-6 hours a day. Of course I also think about my research when I'm at home, but I don't have more than 6-8 hours of active working time per day. However, it seems that more senior researchers routinely do 10 hour days and much of that time is taken by pointless bureaucracy, writing grant applications, etc., not actual research.

Even in jobs where peope are actually occupied the whole time (waitresses, people working on some assembly line, etc.), the working time could be reduced easily by just taking more employees. It makes absolutely no sense that we have a large portion of the population unemployed while the people who work have to put in larger and larger number of hours.</text>

This is the case in many retail and service jobs. Very few grocery store cashiers are working 40 hours, for example.
