    <title>CMV: Kink and BDSM should not be at public pride events and should be kept for 18+ ones</title>
    <original_poster>akoudagawaismywaifu</original_poster>
    <original_post>To start, I am a lesbian. And I've been seeing recent controversy about this topic. 

Look, no denying that kink plays a big role in the creation of pride. It is a part of embracing sexuality and shouldn't be excluded from the community. 

However, it should not be at public pride parades. Pride should be for everyone of all ages. Many people say "stop catering to the straight capitalized ideal of what pride should be" and "pride isn't a party, it's a protest don't police us" and "children should go to disney if they want family friendly" This has nothing to do with straight rainbow capitalism. I figured out I was LGBT at age 11 and trust me if I saw a kink act in public I would be kind of disgusted. I'm still a minor now, and I'd be less disgusted but still. I know people say that it's up to you to bring your children to pride, but by making all pride events "wear whatever you want even if it's nothing" we are also kinda excluding minors from it. It's also non consensual to anyone who is exposed to such acts, because nobody wants to go to pride to see naked people right? The "think of the children" phrase holds true here. Young children and teens embracing their sexuality shouldn't be forced to see adult acts against their will. 

Again, no denying the role kink plays in the community, but it should be kept at 18+ events. There should definitely be a separate pride for people who just want to do leather and other kinks. That way, you can do whatever you want in a safe space where you know you won't offend others, and because people consented to come to an 18+ event, it's all good. 

That's just my personal opinion on it, but it seems to be the minority. I'd like to see how you guys think about this.

Edit: it appears after reading and responding to several comments, I don't really have a problem with kink, but more with public indecency. I don't care if you wear a collar or leather pants. But I'd rather not see things that could get you arrested or questioned for doing in public.</original_post>

    <text>No they don't [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp9X3xtbyc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efp9X3xtbyc)

Not to mention the whole "drag queen story hour" craze a couple years ago where multiple men at some of these events ended up being registered pedophiles, people need to leave kids alone</text>

    <text>Besides the fact that this is one incident (and this isn’t “dancing” like the video suggests it is. The other was a person in drag singing), at Pride Parades there are sections that are 18+ only.</text>

    <text>Not in Orlando, Florida. Here, I've seen people walj around naked at pride events, and there's no 18+ area. It's just out there.
Edit: a word.</text>

    <text>And if you are seeing full on nakedness, it's either a rarity or you are exaggerating.</text>

    <text>It's not a lot of people, but it does happen. And I'm not saying nudity is wrong, just that there are no 18+ separate areas at pride events in my city, which speaks to OP's point.</text>

    <text>I'm not sure how Orlando works, but most places have some kind of separate events or to keep them fully clothed. Vegas, for example oddly enough, has had fully clothed Pride events unless there were some I'm not aware of.</text>
