    <title>cmv: Canada should install dirty atomic bombs in each big lake as an invasion deterrent.</title>
    <original_poster>maxi1134</original_poster>
    <original_post>With the upcoming climate changes and the fact that Canada has 20% of the freshwater reserve in the world. Russia, America, and other states might have an interest in invading Canada to access the water reserves and the Canadian north that will taw out and become available for crops.    
  

With this information, I believe that rigging the water table to be radioactive for eons in case of invasion would be the perfect deterrent to prevent the invasion from any other state.   

  

Especially America, as their water table would then also be contaminated</original_post>

    <text>I find it impossible to imagine a world where the leadership of powerful nations has gone so haywire that invading *Canada* is an actual threat. The stability of international politics would have to have been absolutely trashed for that to on the table. 

If the world were in such a state of instability that Canada is under threat of invasion, it also means that the likelihood that Canada's leadership is also relatively unstable. The world isn't going to go to shit while Canada just chugs along the way they are, they'd be brought down with it. 


The likelihood of the person you want to be in charge of this dirty bomb being the person who winds up in control is just so low, and there are so many risks involved. This is a terrible idea.</text>
