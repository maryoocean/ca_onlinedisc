    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>FWIW Seems like the only people who actually care about this are never those supposedly impacted by it.  As such their opinion on the topic carries incredibly little weight.  May as well criticize the EU for using "European" in their name when they don't include massive amounts of Europe.  It's simply an eyeroll worthy attempt at a performative hot take.</text>
