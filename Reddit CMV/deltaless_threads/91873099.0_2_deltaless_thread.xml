    <title>"Large" dating age gaps between teenagers (for example, 3 years) is shallow, "slutty" and desperate, and I can't help looking down on people who take part in them. CMV</title>

    <original_post>I'm 18, I'm still part of the teenage dating world. 

My ex girlfriend met her ex boyfriend when she was 14, she started dating him when she turned 15. He was 18 years old. There was a constant weight on our relationship because of it. I thought the 3 year age gap was too much. When we argued I would call her horrible things like "slut" and "desperate". 

I have a friend who is 18, she's dating a 23 year old. I secretly think "slut" in my head too when I talk to her. 

Some of my friends who are 18 are dating 15 year olds. I have a 20 year old friend who's sleeping with a 16 year old.  I can't help of thinking of them as dirty, greasy, liars, users etc 

I know people can like or date whoever they want, and I shouldn't judge them for it. Age gaps when we get older mean nothing. But in our teenage years, 3+ year age gaps strike me as disgusting, immoral and just... "Wrong". I actually get visibly angry when I hear a friend I've known for years is sleeping with a 14 year old girl. 

If a 15 year old tried to sleep with me, I would laugh at them and tell them to beat it. I am not sexually attracted to anyone much younger than me. 

I know my view is sexist and fucked up.  I know that maybe it's because I'm just jealous because I never experienced these romances while growing up, or maybe I'm actually just an ephebophile and jealous of people getting what I want . I know it's possible I only have these thoughts because I'm a misogynist and have been (unsuccessfully) suppressing it. But please, try and explain it in a way that's respectful and not insulting. I'm trying to change my view for the better here and I don't think I handle hostility very well (I shut down) 

Thanks.  Oh and by the way I have a girlfriend and she 's close to my age. </original_post>

    <text>I sort of agree with you. I don't really like it when there are huge age gaps between daters, and it usually is older guy with a younger girl. I remember being 23, graduated and working. Why would I date some 19 year old who is studying for their first year calculus? There is a gap of 'maturity' that diminishes as people get past 25, in my opinion. Plus some of the guys that do this are kind of nasty or they don't have success with women their age because they have no status. It's easier to look cool in a Honda Integra at 25 to 19 year olds than women who are 25 and have their own sexy cars.

But - there are a lot of exceptions. For one thing, I look like I'm 18. Some women look really young but are much older. One of my friends is 35 and looks 21. Often times, people start dating and their age doesn't really come out until later! I think that's important to note, sometimes we don't really know what someone's age is until much later. 

The other thing is, I'm not sure why you are so hard on the girls. I mean, they are girls, some of them are really young like 14. Do you remember when you were 14? You probably were a dumb, fuck up (like all of us were - some of us have been adults for a while and still fuck up!).

 So a lot of girls make dumb mistakes and get woo-ed by guys (who are also stupid teenagers too). Have you ever made stupid mistakes romantically and been called a slut? Or call the 'greasy' liar guys sluts? You mentioned you get angry a lot with people close to you - maybe there are other things you need to work on such as your view on women? You have obviously alluded to it before about possibly being a misogynist. But hey, at least you are honest with yourself. 

Hope that's helpful.</text>

    <text>Yeah I was a dumb fuckup and I still am.

I didn't make it apparent in my opening post, i hate the douchebag older "users" more than the younger ones, they're just naive and I feel bad for them. I just think that obviously not all girls make those decisions and can see the red flags, and I judge them for not doing so. </text>
