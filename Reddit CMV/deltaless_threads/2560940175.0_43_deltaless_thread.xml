    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>I agree that there is nothing wrong with it.  I also think that Brazilians are American, Mexicans, Argentinians, Peruvians are also all American.

There is a North America, which by the way Mexicans are in.  There is a South America.  Where Brazilians, Columbians and Argentinians live.

Then there is the United States of America.  A place that decided it's entire singular identity does not deserve naming at all and that is a symbol of the USA favoring states rights.  That's fine but ... "the United States of America" is a title not a name, a designation, if you will.

However, it is still in America, North America to be exact.  This it contains Americans.</text>
