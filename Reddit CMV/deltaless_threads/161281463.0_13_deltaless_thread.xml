    <title>CMV: there don't need to be hundreds of gender and sexuality names</title>
    <original_poster>YoungRecluse</original_poster>
    <original_post>I can understand gay, lesbian, queer, bisexual, asexual, pansexual, and aromantic. I can understand cis-, trans-, and a-genders. Why does there need to be demisexual and demiromantic and all that? Why do we need so many classifications of gender and sexuality? If you're attracted to the same sex, why can't you just be homosexual? If you're attracted to the opposite why can't you just be heterosexual? If you're attracted to both, why can't you be bisexual? Attracted to all? You're pansexual.
Keep it simple.

Also, I understand people getting offended and angry when they're misgendered, but getting angry doesn't really accomplish anything unless you can be calm in your education on the subject. Hating people for not calling you by your preferred pronouns the first time when they've never met you before is not going to accomplish anything. Hating cisgendered, heterosexual people will not accomplish anything. 

Please change my view.

    <text>Don't think of all this as me saying "This is who I am, so I need to make sure I fit that box". Labels are description, not prescriptive. If you find an exception to your sexuality, just use the word that makes the most amount of sense to you.


I'm a man, right?

I don't like women, sexually, so I'm gay/homosexual. Sounds good, so I can just get on with my life.

But wait, I don't like men either? This is a pickle, I guess I'm not gay, but I'm still not straight.  I guess I'm asexual, I think..

I'm feeling lonely even though I have friends. I wish there was someone there for me, that we could live our lives and become old together. Like a wife, but no sexual stuff, that doesn't do anything for me.  But I'm asexual, I can't want to be in a relationship!  Oh, I hear people making a distinction between sexuality and romanticism. You mean I can be one, but not the other!

I still don't like guys, but that girl there is a lot of fun. Why don't I like guys in the same way? I guess this makes me "hetero-romantic". We become close friends and eventually get married. Luckily, she's understanding and doesn't want children, so she's cool with our relationship not being sexual.

Some years later, Gender Dysphoria comes to a head. God I hate being a guy, that glove never fit right. I must be mistaken -- I am actually transsexual. But people don't understand that word, but a newer word is becoming more popular: transgender... having a gender identity other than the sex that you were born.

Oh, this is weird. I'm still romantically attracted to women, but the words don't make sense anymore. I'm  straight? Hetero-romantic? No, I can't be... being a woman, I must be gay or homo-romantic!

Cool! Things are making sense now! I mean, things are better than they were. Everything's not 100%, but I'm on the right path. I'm actually finding that I identify more in-between than either gender.  I'm still queer, but my gender can't be easily defined -- genderqueer -- I met some people using that term, and you know what? It makes more sense than man or woman did for me before.

---

From this experience, I'm still spending time in queerspaces, especially online. I'm meeting new people, and still exploring myself. If I want to introduce myself, I guess I can just call myself "person" and be done with that, but I have need for more words to do so.

I could describe myself as a person "between genders that's not sexually attracted to people, but would like to find a long-term relationship with a woman", or I could describe myself with more concise terms: "asexual, homo-romantic, genderqueer".  These terms can be as concise as I need them to be, but that's their key purpose, to convey those ideas.

\* As a note, I'm not the person describe above, although I'm close: "demi-grey-gay trans woman". It's much easier to use these terms than to have to describe the details of my sexuality to anyone that needs to know.</text>
