    <title>CMV: Donald Trump has taken concrete steps toward establishing a fascist regime, and "losing an election" won't be enough to successfully remove him.</title>

    <original_post>I'm not here to argue whether Trump will win the election, I'm here to argue that it may not matter whether he does.

Right now, what is happening in Portland is what I've come to understand through observation as Trump "flexing" against the barriers that constrain him. No one has been permanently harmed by federal agents purely because that would be too big of a step, too early. He is normalizing the relatively minor violence of terrorizing protesters without actually charging them, and priming the GOP base that supports him to readily accept more severe violence against those that do not support him.

This kind of flexing has gotten Trump really far. He throws something out that sounds insane at first and lets people digest it. Then he does a relatively minor version of it. Once that is normalized, he ups the ante.

The one that worries me the most is his continuous teasing over whether he will accept the election results, and casting doubt on the validity of the election in general. This is coupled with the fact that he still has four months to look at polls, reflect that he is losing, and decide that he must maintain his power undemocratically if necessary. Even if he doesn't come up with a plan to do so, now, there will still be a two-month gap until Biden's reelection that is usually expected to serve as a nice buffer for an orderly transition of power. I know I've mentioned plans, but Trump doesn't need a plan, here. All he has to do is say: "No." At this point, all the resources of the federal government will still be under his control, and his supporters will have already been primed to accept violence toward protesters.

For the purpose of this view, I don't need Trump to successfully install fascism in the US. If he is removed through force, I will still consider myself "right" in the sense that a peaceful election was not enough. My view will be changed if I'm led to believe that Trump will lose the presidency without necessitating violence, or inciting it for his benefit.

EDIT: I have already awarded Deltas to some people who argued in good faith. Starting now, I can't promise that I will respond to everyone, but I definitely will no longer engage with anyone who argues with me on bad faith, or uses personal insults. Thanks to everyone who has presented good arguments.</original_post>

    <text>What is happening in Portland is actually a welcome respite from woke idiot mayors refusing to do their jobs and allowing the citizens of their cities to suffer because of it. If the mayor refuses to impose regular order, then I'm glad that someone has the ability to step in and do that for them. There's a big difference between what Donald Trump is doing with DHS and what fascist dictators have done in the past. Show me one case of someone who was taking off the street for saying something negative about Donald Trump and not for causing property damage or show me one case of someone who is still missing after 48 hours. The fact that the police didn't have name badges on when they made their arrests is irrelevant, because according to all available sources, they were properly identified and the suspects properly informed of their rights at the time of questioning. Which means no one's civil liberties were violated. The no name badges just goes to show how dangerous things are in certain cities right now, and everyone is refusing to acknowledge that, because it goes against the narrative that Trump is evil.

Additionally, I really just don't think Donald Trump is going to try a military coup rather than just stepping down. Furthermore, there's 0% chance that anyone with any real power to overthrow the government will back him up on that. So what's he going to do lock himself in the oval office and refuse to come out? That's just icing on the cake when capital police break down the door and drag him out and handcuffs. There's no chance that anything Donald Trump has done has moved to this country more towards fascism, and you seriously need to take a step back and get in touch with reality.</text>
