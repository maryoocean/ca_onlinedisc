    <title>CMV: There are no good or bad music genres, just good or bad artists.</title>
    <original_poster>Andresk99</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it. Rock is your favorite music genre, you hate country or pop. Whatever it is, it doesn‚Äôt make your favorite genre ‚Äúthe one‚Äù.

Music is like food. There‚Äôs pizza, hamburguers, sandwiches, tacos, burritos, nuggets, etc. That doesn‚Äôt make one better than the other. But there are people or restaurants that can make great delicious pizzas and others who make average pizzas. The same way, there are amazing rappers with great lyricism and rhythm, and others who use an overproduced beat and have poor lyricism. There are Metal guitarists with great technique and years of experience, and others who don‚Äôt.

And this whole ‚Äúmy favorite genre is better than yours‚Äù thing applies to almost everything: books, videogames, movies...</original_post>

    <text>Christian Rock is objectively awful. It doesn‚Äôt make Christianity any better, it just makes Rock &amp;amp; Roll worse. Even the most talented artist could not perform Christian Rock without sounding cringe. Same goes for Christian Rap.</text>

    <text>&amp;gt;it just makes Rock &amp;amp; Roll worse.

"worse" is a subjective opinion, YOU think it makes rock and roll worse

&amp;gt;Even the most talented artist could not perform Christian Rock without sounding cringe

"cringe" is also a subjective opinion, what you find cringe isnt necessarily what i find cringe</text>
