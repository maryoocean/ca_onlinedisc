    <title>CMV: American cities are terribly designed and administered compared with European cities.</title>
    <original_poster>bostoninwinston</original_poster>
    <original_post>Most American cities are terrible compared to European ones. I'm not talking about big cities like NYC or SF- I mean the typical- the average- American city- is just awful by any objective comparison. You can go to out of the way cities in Italy or France, Germany or Belgium, and they build places as though their great-grandchildren would be proud to live there. Here, the average city has no city center, major monuments, or sense of history. In the US. there are few places to gather. The social life of American cities is incomparably lifeless compared to European cities. Our Cities are heavily segregated by race and economic class in the way European cities aren't. The architecture here is mostly corporatist modernism, and looks cookie-cutter. It quickly gets dated in the way the art of European cities don't. People here have to get around by car, and as a result are fatter and live shorter lives than the average European. Our unhealthiness contributes to our under-productivity. The average European city is vastly more productive than the average American one â€“ despite Europeans having dramatically more benefits, time off, vacations in, and shorter work hours on average. We damage our environment far more readily than European cities do. Our cities are designed often in conflict with the rule areas that surround them, whereas many European cities are built integrated into their environment. We spend more money on useless junk thank Europeans do. Our food isn't as good quality. Our water is often poisoned with lead and arsenic, and our storm drainage systems are easily overrun compared to European water management systems.  European cities are managing rising seas and the problems related to smog far better than American cities are. 

I can't think of a single way in which American cities are broadly speaking superior to European ones. Change my view.</original_post>

    <text>Your comparing very small countries in comparison to the united states. Its easier to make one city great in one country, but the us has 50 states with many many cities. Pretend that the us was small and ny was there capital. Puts things into perspective i think</text>

    <text>But the Europeans don't have just one great city in each Country- France doesn't just have Pairs- they have Rennes, Toulouse, Marseille, etc. Italy doesn't just have Rome, but Venice, Florence, Sienna, Lucca, Piza, Venice, Milan, Viterbo, Naples, Sorreno, Amalfi, Genoa, Syracuse, Turin, Trento, Bolzano- the list is absolutely enormous! 

Perhaps what you're getting at is the fact that all of these cities were at one point out as the center of their own country in medieval Europe, and so there was an environment of competition in city building that simply doesn't exist, and never existed, in the United States. This may have incentivized more compact, defensible cities, with independent resources like access to their own fresh water supply. That's a good point but I don't think it changes my view.</text>
