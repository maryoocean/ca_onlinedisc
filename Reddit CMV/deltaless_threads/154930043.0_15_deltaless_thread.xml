    <title>CMV: I believe that cannabis is an objectively better substance for recreational use than alcohol</title>
    <original_poster>ProjectGO</original_poster>
    <original_post>*(Note: I will be using the term cannabis instead of marijuana, weed, or pot, since that is the proper name for the plant and does not carry slang or propaganda connotations like the other common terms do. Also, for the purposes of the CMV cannabis consumption refers to the inhalation of smoke from burning cannabis buds, as opposed to more exotic methods of consumption.)*

As an adult of legal age in Washington state, I am allowed to purchase cannabis from a government-licensed store and consume it in my own house. For the purpose of this CMV, let's assume others have similar rights such that legality is not a concern.

The known effect (and implicit goal) of drinking alcohol or smoking cannabis is to temporarily alter the brain's chemistry to produce enjoyable sensations. By almost every metric I can think of, cannabis is a superior substance to use to achieve this goal.

* **Safety:** Alcohol poisoning, alcohol related organ failures, and intoxicated accidents kill hundreds of thousands of people a year. Very drunk people are known to become violent, emotional, and dangerous to themselves and others. Cannabis's effects are caused by THC, which is very nontoxic to ingest. The amount of THC required to overdose and die from cannabis use is literally impossible to consume quickly enough to maintain a fatal saturation. Studies have shown that [cannabis use does not lead to more driving accidents](http://norml.org/library/item/marijuana-and-driving-a-review-of-the-scientific-evidence) and the most common effect of driving high in simulator tests is reduced speed. (Still, don't drive impaired, regardless of what you're using). I can only speak from anecdotal evidence, but I have never seen cannabis cause an aggressive or violent reaction in the user.

* **Controlled intoxication:** Consuming alcohol with a specific level of intoxication in mind (other than blackout drunk) is a challenging task. Variations in drink strength and methods of consumption can make it harder to judge one's level of intoxication, and the timing and order of consumption plays a significant role in how the alcohol affects the body and how enjoyable the experience is. The duration of alcohol intoxication is usually many hours, which generally means that by consuming alcohol the drinker has implicitly accepted that they will not be safely able to do certain tasks or make certain decisions for the remainder of the day/night. Cannabis, especially state regulated cannabis, comes with detailed information regarding THC content and the heredity of the specific plant being consumed. This allows the user to tailor their cannabis experience to achieve or avoid specific effects, and with some planning (although no more than counting your drinks) accurately control the length and intensity of their cannabis intoxication. The duration of intoxication from smoking cannabis is typically shorter than that of consuming alcohol, and leaves the user capable of functioning normally with few ill effect after use.

* **Effects:** Alcohol generally lowers the inhibitions, impairs the judgement, and increases the volume of the person consuming it. Heavy consumption can lead to loss of motor control, disorientation, blackouts, and alcohol poisoning. The effects of cannabis depend largely on the genetics of the plant in question, and can be carefully tailored by growers to induce a specific intoxicating effect. Plants from the species *Cannabis Indica* tend to cause feelings of calm, drowsiness, and relaxation. Plants from the species *Cannabis Sativa* tend to cause uplifting, energetic, or cerebral effects. Excessive consumption of cannabis may lead to dizziness, paranoia, or 'couch-lock', but there are no chemically harmful effects (such as alcohol poisoning).

* **Aftermath:** Hangovers suck. Waking up and feeling like you just want to trow up and die is no fun at all. Cannabis has negligible aftereffects, and (anecdotally again) cannabis use after heavy alcohol consumption significantly reduces the pain of the next morning's hangover. Alcohol and alcohol byproducts remain in the body for 1-2 days at most after intoxicating effects have ceased. Cannabis byproducts remain in the bloodstream and urine for 2-6 weeks depending on frequency of use and body type, and can be detected in hair samples far beyond that.

* **Price:** In Washington, lower-end state-regulated liquor sells for around $35 per 1.75 liters. This converts to about $1 per shot, which is on par with roughly $1 a beer when buying from a grocery store. Assuming consumption of 6 drinks in a night, the at-home cost is $6. At a bar, event, or stadium, drink prices are significantly more expensive, and 6 drinks (including tips) can quickly surpass $50. At current prices (which are expected to fall as supply and demand balance out) you can purchase 2 grams of high-potency cannabis from a regulated store for $60. Calculating an equivalent scale of grams of cannabis per drink is a difficult task, but by my math (2g can make 4 0.5g bowls which can each get 3 people to the equivalent intoxication of 5 drinks) it still comes out to roughly $1 per drink equivalent. Bulk cannabis from a medical co-op is much less expensive ($250 per oz = 28g), and lowers the price to $0.30 per drink equivalent.

* **Social acceptance:** Alcohol wins this one hands down. In adulthood, someone who doesn't consume alcohol occasionally is considered the exception rather than the norm. Cannabis is still widely seen in the connotations of "dope for hippies and stoners", and cannabis use is not considered a suitable topic for discussion the way alcohol use is. Much of modern nightlife is centered around going out and consuming alcohol socially, and there is no equivalent cannabis culture yet. For younger audiences there are a wide range of drinking games played socially with alcohol, but few (if any) social games revolving around cannabis consumption.

In short, I believe that cannabis is objectively superior to alcohol in terms of achieving a state of recreational intoxication. By the metrics I have stated, I feel that cannabis is the superior substance in all cases except social acceptance, and that is a nebulous metric that is subject to change and unrelated to the effects that either substance has on the user. 

The best way to CMV would be to point out one or more metrics I have not considered where alcohol is preferable to cannabis, or show that my logic in assessing the metrics I have used is incorrect. The goal of this CMV is not to start an argument between 'stoners' and 'teetotalers', but rather to objectively compare two intoxicating substances on their merits and drawbacks.

**TL;DR:** All things considered, I'd rather get intoxicated on cannabis than on alcohol.

    <text>first note - I've never used marijuana nore do I intend to ever do so. But since you asked for objectivity, I don't see why that matters too much. The way I see it you can simplify the arguments for and against considerably.

Health - Marijuana is particularly safe - there is no acute dose of THC that will kill a person. It also doesn't have any well accepted health benefits via regular use by healthy persons. Alcohol is indeed unquestionably more dangerous - drinking particularly large quantities of alcohol can lead to heavy temporary impairment all the way up to death and massive organ failure. In small quantities, consumed on a daily basis, however, it's associated with longer life expectancy. Also many of not almost all alcoholic drinks contain nutrients just by virtue of what they're made of. Carbohydrates, B vitamins, antioxidants, minerals, etc. 

Socially - Alcohol is quite frankly a social drug - and not just because it's socially accepted. The first effect of alcohol consumption is, at a low dose, a stimulant that lowers social inhibitions. 1 or 2 drinks in an evening leads to a calm and particularly social evening. All the dramatic effects - aggressiveness, depression, poor motor control, etc are from consuming particularly large quantities of alcohol, far past the ideal level of consumption for desirable effects. Why people still go to parties and brag about getting drunk still amazing me. My best guess is that it's due to the poor decision making leading to interesting events. But it's not the directly social aspect of the drug. The dangerous effects - blackouts, alcohol poisoning, etc, are WAY too much. It's when a person desires to get crazy drunk, and then drinks like 5 more drinks. It's hard to blame the drug itself when the warnings were plastered on their face and manneurisms for the better part of a few hours. But either way, the after-effects of alcohol depend entirely on how far down this route you went. one or two or three drinks in a night will not cause a the deydration necessary to cause a hangeover. And if you are in that situation,b ecause it's due primarily to deyhdration and/or stillb eing slightly intoxicated, drinking water or taking an IV of saline will fix this almost instantly. 

I'm less familiar with the effects of marijuana, and cursory research seems to say that it varies widely from person to person. I see listed euphoria and relaxation in the same sentence as anxiety and  paranoia. I then see increased memory recollection and philosophical thinking, along with linear memory disruption. Apparently the most reported effect is anxiety, with roughly 20-30% of users experiencing it.  Social aspects are all, as far as I can tell, only tangentally related by circumstance rather than the drugs use.

ease of obtaining - alcohol can be made from any source of sugar, and done so very easily. It has thus been made across almost all cultures in the world, one way or another. It is thus also very cheap and easy to create and sell low quality alcohol. The expense comes from making specific types, flavors, and so forth. More of the expense also comes from taxes, which are relatively high in much of the world. If all alcohol was banned, or wiped instantly from the world, it would not take long to restart the industry, as we still consume things that have or can be made into sugar.  

Marijuana is a plant that is specifically grown for the purpose of consumption. If it is wild it likely doesn't have the same effects. It is, however, an easy to grow crop that requires little in the way of processing. But for how easy it is to obtain, and how little tax and how much wide  variety there is in the marijuana market, it doesn't compare at all to the alcohol market, and it never will. If you do not care about the flavor of the alcohol, you can make it yourself with large quantities, and many people do just that at far cheaper than the $35 per 1.75 liters mentioned. Heck, there are wines that have won awards that sell for $2 for a liter, and cheap home-made drinks can be made for half that.</text>
