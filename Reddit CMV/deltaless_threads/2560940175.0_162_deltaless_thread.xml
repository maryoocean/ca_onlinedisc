    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>There's no continent called America, there are the Americas, North and South respectively, which you can call America but in general why would you even refer to someone from Argentina as an American and not a South American? The most appropriate terms to use in my opinion are North American, Central American, or South American, but American is known to everyone as a citizen of the US. 

This is honestly just another example of well intentioned but ultimately ignorant and (probably) white people being offended by non-problems.</text>
