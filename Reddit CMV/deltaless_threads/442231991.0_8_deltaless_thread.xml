    <title>CMV: Christianity is held together through fear</title>
    <original_poster>M1STER_B0NES</original_poster>
    <original_post>My opinion is that if the fear of going to Hell was not present in the Christian ideology, then most of the followers of the religion would not be there.

Before I decided I was agnostic, that was my only reason for continuing to identify with the religion. Then, I decided I wasn't going to let fear control me. 

All in all, I don't see how this is any different than blackmailing a person to do what you want. You present your instruction, then tell them how you will completely devastate their life if they do not follow through.</original_post>

    <text>Christian here.

While I don't follow the mainstream faith down to a T, I think in many christian denominations and in the majority of the religion, accepting Christ isn't out of fear of hell. Quite the opposite: we don't fear hell because we have said faith in Christ.</text>

    <text>Er, I don't understand how that's the opposite? Here's an analogy that maybe illustrates why this doesn't make sense to me. "I don't carry a gun with me out of fear of getting mugged. Quite the opposite: I don't fear getting mugged because I carry a gun with me." Doesn't the second statement imply that if I didn't carry a gun with me that I would fear getting mugged? Doesn't it support the idea that I carry a gun with me out of fear of getting mugged?

I'm not trying to say you fear hell. I believe you when you say you don't. But your explanation confuses me.</text>

    <text>That's fair, it is a bit odd to explain.</text>
