    <title>CMV: All workplace buildings and schools should have Male,Female and unisex bathrooms</title>
    <original_poster>The_Man_in_your_wall</original_poster>
    <original_post>I work as a teacher in a very LGBT friendly school. which is good. but a small group of students do not identify as a male nor female. and the school only has unisex bathrooms. lots of the students that are sticking to there born gender feel uncomfterble being in the same bathroom that the opposite gender is in.  
A 9 Year old girl that was a student told me that there were pubes on the toilet seat. and another boy 11 year old came up to me and said that there were used tampons in the toilet bowl and floor. BTW this school is for kids year 1 to 13. many teachers think there should be male and female bathrooms.  
Im not sure if other workplace buildings for schools have this but i think there should be male, female and unisex bathrooms</original_post>
