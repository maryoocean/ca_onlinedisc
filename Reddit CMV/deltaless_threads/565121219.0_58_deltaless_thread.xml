    <title>CMV: it is a jerk move to play music while camping within earshot of other campers.</title>

    <original_post>We put a tent up in a state park campground for about 4 weeks out of the summer. Most of the time you can just hear nature, people talking, kids playing, lots of birds and squirrels  . Every 5th day or so, there is someone who brings some Bluetooth speakers so they can listen to music , but loud  enough  that people in a half dozen sites nearby get to ‘enjoy’ whatever they are playing. 

Right now I’m cooking dinner and the guys next to me are playing U2, Dave Matthew Band and similar inoffensive crap.

This would be entirely normal in a backyard gathering, but once you reserve to be in a public campground, it becomes selfish, intrusive,  rude.

Am I wrong?

(I know it’s a known risk of car camping. I’m not really  mad. More rolling my eyes. I wish they’d shut that crap off.  )

    <text>Im with OP and hate when people do this.  However, you can respectfully listen to music at a campsite.  If you want to listen to music at a campsite put it at a level you think isn’t too loud and then walk away from your campsite and if you can still hear it turn it down to the point where you can’t hear it if you leave your site.  It also helps to play something like the Beatles that pretty much everyone enjoys if they have to hear it anyway and not some incredibly obnoxious dubstep.</text>
