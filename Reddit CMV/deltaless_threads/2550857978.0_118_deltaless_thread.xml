    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>Just means you can't treat police like allies by default because they're designed to not be your friends. But it doesn't discount that there could be good people. 

Racism is an addition into the fact that all police are made to be your enemy in that human nature sinks into our actions and while they're both built to be our enemy they can also have a racial preference as most people do. This is how the black/white part enters the conversations as a justification to show that the system has pitted a person who has a propensity for this against the populace and evidence for badness. 

Cops have been abusing power since the position was created and that's the underlying premise.</text>
