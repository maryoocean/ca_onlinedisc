    <title>CMV: To combat rape and counteract the general physical advantage men have over women, girls should be taught self-defence at school, specifically anti-rape techniques.</title>

During a self-defence class I attended, the instructor demonstrated several techniques for women to use when attacked by a rapist. He explained that the positions a male rapist would need to assume to rape a female victim are actually extremely vulnerable from a ground fighting perspective. Correctly applied Brazilian jui-jitsu would use the attacker's weight against him and provide an opportunity for the victim to attack (the eyes, usually) and then escape.

I'm not a martial arts expert but if this is all true, then girls should be taught to defend themselves from rape and assault, possibly in their early teens. It's not a panacea for sexual violence, I admit, but it will empower women physically and be an effective deterrent.  

Edit: Found a Youtube video with the kind of techniques I'm talking about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D8r-wH0dkk</original_post>
