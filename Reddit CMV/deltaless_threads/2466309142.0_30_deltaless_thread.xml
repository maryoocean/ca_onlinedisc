    <title>CMV: I hate America with a burning passion</title>
    <original_poster>HoovyKitty</original_poster>
    <original_post> I am a European and I've visited America for a couple of weeks before (east coast) but I just hate America and a lot of American's for some reason. The joke here has always been that American's are fat and stupid, but I always took that joke with a grain of salt, but ever since I vistied, I've believed that statement and agreed with it fully. I hate all of the food in America and how it's bland and fattening, I hate Americans all over the internet treating America like the center of the world, I hate it when I google something and the results are about America instead of the world, I also hate the stupid (to me) measurements like pounds (written lbs??) feet, inches, miles and whatnot. Also, I don't get their obsession with guns, I've never understood how they can have so many shootings, and I get that it's a massive country, but compared to the entirety of Europe it's still insane. The thing is, there are countries in Europe and elsewhere that have way more things that I dislike about them, hell, even my own country sucks, everyone here is depressed, hates themselves and hates eachother and we still suffer from Russian influence, but for some reason America just makes me want to make fun of it and hate it way more.</original_post>

    <text>Look, I'll be the first to say there's a LOT to hate about America, but if you came here and your impression of our food is that it's all bland and fattening, then that's on you. You must have only gone to really shitty fast food or something. America has the most diverse food culture on the planet. We have a wider variety of high quality food here than you'll find anywhere else on Earth. If you couldn't find any of it, that's because you didn't try that hard to find it.

&gt; I also hate the stupid (to me) measurements like pounds (written lbs??) feet, inches, miles and whatnot.

Blame the British for that. They brought the English units here when they colonized North America. We didn't invent them. And blame the Romans for the 'lbs' abbreviation. It comes from when Rome colonized Britain and introduced their system of weights. It was "libra pondo" in Latin, which means "a pound by weight." The word eventually changed to "pound" but the abbreviation comes from the "libra" part.</text>
