    <title>CMV: Saying white people in general shouldn't feel guilty for the actions of specific, individual white people isn't an example of white fragility.</title>
    <original_poster>LucidMetal</original_poster>
    <original_post>I was recently banned from /whitepeopletwitter for this comment:

&amp;gt;I don't think "white people" need to feel guilty about this. You're just internalizing an issue over which you don't have control. What we need to do is figure out a way to combat the revisionist history narratives and misinformation that are plaguing conservative spheres (I don't want to say "echo chamber" because let's be honest everyone lives in an echo chamber these days).

I don't care that I was banned to be clear. I do care that the reason seemed incorrect. The reason given was:

&amp;gt;White fragility is racist.

I do believe "white fragility" as a concept exists in America i.e. many white people exhibit a negative reaction including anger, fear, guilt, arguing, silence, or leaving the stress-inducing situation when they encounter discussions of race. I have no idea how pervasive it is because I don't encounter it very frequently but I have encountered it and I know my friends who belong to minority racial groups say it happens frequently for them. 

I don't think the ban was justified (but who cares) and I don't think white fragility is racism (I suppose easy delta here if you can show me why) but I also don't see why my comment is an example of white fragility.

As far as I remember it's the opposite! It was saying OP should not feel guilt when discussing the Buffalo shooter since it was a specific person with a specific worldview not "white people". I can't post the comment I was responding to because it's been deleted but it was along the lines of "white people should feel guilty for the Buffalo shooter".

EDIT: Alright, found the parent using Unddit! This is what I was responding to:

&amp;gt;“My kids shouldn’t feel guilty for slavery two hundred years ago!”

&amp;gt;News flash asshole, they should feel guilty for what happened in the past week.</original_post>

    <text>I'm merely saying white people shouldn't feel guilty not that white people are generally responsible for systemic racism. I'm more interested in the accountability - I feel like the second part of my statement is specifically seeking accountability.</text>

    <text>"White people" don't need to be held responsible. Specific individuals who do bad things need to be responsible, but "white people" as a whole do not.</text>

    <text>The concept of "white fragility" "argument" should be dismissed right away, because is just a fallacy by itself. It's a Kafkatrap, a sophistical rhetorical device, in which any denial by the accused person, is used as if was evidence of guilt.  
  
Example: "You deny been a witch? Then you're a witch, because that's what a witch would say"  
  
It's circular thinking and a specious way of shifting the burden of proof (because you don't have any evidence to prove your accusation on the first place). Its a gotcha, like "damn you if you do (admitting you are a racist), and also damn you if you don't (deny that you are a racist)"</text>

    <text>Accountable for what? Hold yourselves accountable and get a job and quit whining. Biggest bunch of whiners ever trying to force blame on an entire group of people based on their skin color.

People are responsible for their own actions.</text>
