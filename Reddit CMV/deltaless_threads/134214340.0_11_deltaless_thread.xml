    <title>CMV: I Believe a Sustainable Market for Video Games Oriented Towards Women Exists, and that Feminism Would Be Better Served to Develop For It Than Merely Complain About It</title>
    <original_poster>OhCrapADinosaur</original_poster>
    <original_post>E3 took place the past couple of days, and of the various bits of news from the event, Ubisoft announced their Assassin's Creed title. I'm wholly indifferent to the Assassin's Creed games, but apparently this game features 4 person local multiplayer and only includes a slate of male characters. As a result of this news, some of my feminist former-friends posted articles to this effect: http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/11/5799386/no-female-characters-in-assassins-creed-unity-too-much-work

I'm not going to weigh in on the truth of Ubisoft's claims particularly, whether or not their claims were justified, or whether any of the views held by either side is right and just. The general consensus among the feminism crowd seemed to be along the lines that:

* 1. There are many sexist stereotypes prevalent in video games, possibly moreso in mainstream titles, and particularly noticed (by the feminists) are those stereotypes concerning women.
* 2. There is a large and substantial base of female gamers, many of whom would presumably enjoy games that break stereotypes and employ strong female lead characters
* 3. Many popular games today don't necessarily serve female gamers so well

I'm not going to suggest that feminists shouldn't complain (well, I might a little), but from my vantage point that's pretty much all I see get done. If you actually believe 1, 2, and 3 above, then there might be a GOLDEN MARKET OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU and you should invest your ranting energy into developing for this female gamer market (it's also overwhelmingly likely that this is, in fact, already being done and I'm just not particularly aware of it). Barriers to entry have probably never been lower to go develop for almost any platform you like, and indy games that hit it big have the opportunity to hit it REALLY big. You could make the video game equivalent of "Orange is the New Black" and have millions of loving, adoring fans who will cheer and talk about how you helped bring women into the video game mainstream. And hey, money!

Sadly, this attitude didn't much win over my feminist friends, who more or less told me to shut up and go fuck myself. So... yeah, I fail to see the problem with my thinking. Anybody want to help me out?

    <text>Women are not interested in game development. There are very few of them involved in this type of thing. Your thought process is wrong because you're giving women way too much credit, they don't want to do it. They don't want to learn how to code. There's barely any women doing this type of thing. </text>

    <text>I'm a woman who is in the process of coding a game in Unity right now. No, it's not a Science-based Dragon MMO. I've taken a Game Development course and received the highest score in my class (which was male-dominated, but did have about 10% females). 

Even though more men than women are interested in game dev, to say "you're giving women way too much credit" is just insulting either way. I don't know why your comment is at the top of this thread, frankly.

Edit: My first game had a female protagonist, although I didn't consciously do it for 'feminist' reasons or whatever. It was a natural decision. Conversely, the one I'm working on now features a male protagonist. I'm also interested in making one about animals (not anthropomorphic ones). 

I'd never conceptualize a game with conscious inspiration from women's or men's rights because that really just gives me bad vibes. I would, however, avoid the inclusion of shallow characters in a storygame whose only contribution would be eyecandy, male or female. Characters usually need depth to make a good game, anyway.</text>

Really? How is that (Unity)? How are your experiences with it? I was eying the other day and was looking into messing around with it and would love somebody's perspective :-)</text>

    <text>Quick, incredibly flexible, and has almost every basic component needed. Unity Technologies even has an Oculus Rift SDK. Unity has official [starter tutorials](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules) that are well-structured and easy to understand. [Here's another resource if you use C#](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Developing-Games-Unity-Beginners/dp/1849696586).

Use [Screenshot Saturday threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/search?q=screenshot+saturday&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;t=all) on r/gamedev to get motivated. 

Use [Unity3D](http://www.reddit.com/r/unity3d) for resources and any questions you may have.</text>

    <text>All I said was there's barely any women doing this, and it seems like you agree. 

&amp;gt;Even though more men than women are interested in game dev, to say "you're giving women way too much credit" is just insulting either way.

By this I mean that due to how few women are interested in making video games and how little experience they have it's absurd to expect enough women to come together and make video games that can compete with the quality of what men have been doing for many years. It's very likely the Unity engine you're using was developed by men. </text>

    <text>Depends how you define 'barely'... ratio-wise, the #'s are small in comparison to men, but CS is a huuuuuge and constantly growing field (and gamedev roots from it). And according to Wikipedia, "A National Public Radio report in 2013 stated that about [20% of all US computer programmers are female](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing)." Would you still call that 'barely'?

Regardless, there are multiple aspects of game development that are more "female friendly" which significantly impact the final result.

To be completely honest, I don't see many 'anti-feminist' themes in modern games, anyway, aside from the seemingly *intentionally and comically misogynistic* Duke Nukem 3D. Have I missed something? Even when it comes to the article in question -- it seems like something you'd have to *try* to be mad at.
