    <title>CMV: There must be some conspiracy or governmental cover-up regarding this missing plane.</title>
    <original_poster>billingsley</original_poster>
    <original_post>There is no way a plane can go missing in the year 2014 without any official having any clue what happened to it. The globe is surveilled every second. I read my license plate from a Google maps view of my house. The NSA has the power to read every piece of digital communication we send... and yet a plane full of people with phones went missing. That cannot be. 
I just don't understand how a plane can go missing. If they get any information at all from the black box, won't that lead them right to it? If the NSA can read my texts and track my phone, can't someone track the phones of the people on the plane? There is 1000 ways for my government to spy on me. When the boston bomber went missing the swat team used heat seeking technology to find him hiding in a boat in someone's back yard. And somehow a $50 million plane disappeared into thin air. With no crash evidence... no nothing.

Something is up. Not sure what, but somebody is up to something. 
CMV?

    <text>So you read your license plate from a Google Maps view of your house.  Was this their streetview or overhead map?  Either way, want to bet they don't have a picture for today?

But no, they can't get any information from the black box, it's not broadcasting that strong a signal, the transponder on it is very limited.  There may be a thousand ways for the government to spy on you, but odds are, they aren't using it right nw.

Besides, the crash evidence?  Is most likely in the Ocean, do you know how vast a space that is, and how deep it is?  If they'd crashed on land, yeah, it would have likely been found.  In the water?  Not so much.
