    <title>CMV: Gaza could be free if Hamas would stop attacking Israel</title>
    <original_poster>Ok_Contribution_6321</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm not trying to debate the whole Israel-Palestine conflict but just a small part and I'm very open to changing my view. My thought process is:

* Israel is not trying to settle/colonize/etc Gaza - quite the opposite given that they pulled out and removed settlers in 2005
* The blockade, border wall, and bombings are a response to attacks by Hamas (even if you consider them disproportional)
* Without giving up its territorial claims for all of Israel, Hamas could truly disarm, stop firing rockets and building tunnels, renounce genocidal claims, etc, and instead focus on putting all the aid money toward the people of Gaza
* If they did that in a verifiable way, Israel would have no justification for the blockade or attacks and Gazans could live in peace rather than an "open air prison" as some like to say

tldr; Gaza could have peace and prosperity if Hamas would stop attacking Israel. This would be without renouncing their territorial claims over all of Israel.

This was a political decision which was very controversial at the time. The prime minister's political party split over doing it, and the part which supported the disengagement fell apart over the following years, all but disappearing by 2013.  

The Israeli political spectrum now has shifted increasingly right, and political parties supporting the settlers dominate the government. 
It is incredibly unlikely you'll get even a limited deal like the 2005 deal back now.

&gt;The blockade, border wall, and bombings are a response to attacks by Hamas (even if you consider them disproportional)

Even before Hamas took over the Gaza strip, Israel heavily restricted border traffic, citing security concerns. Gaza used to have a greenhouse industry. While it was heavily damaged during the disengagement (half demolished by settlers as they left, the other half looted by Palestinians in the chaos) what killed the industry was that security were so severe that export was impossible.

In order to be viable, 25 trucks of produce needed to be able to leave the strip, but rarely would more than 3 be able to do so.</text>

    <text>But didn't you know that it's completely justified to kill an entire village if one of them is a partisan?</text>
