    <title>CMV: Money does buy happiness.</title>
    <original_poster>woflcopter</original_poster>
    <original_post>The term "money can't buy happiness" is, I think, false, mainly now within the past years. 

Let's give a scenario: you graduated college, got a decent $50k a year job and you live with your SO who makes around the same. Uh oh, student loans from college start to haunt you now, as well as car insurance, debt, mortgage, and maybe a dozen other things piling on top of that. Really the only way that you could "fix" this is by paying for it with money. 

And let's say that they somehow get a lot of money. And let's say they live in a world where there isn't really a tax or anything (think simple). They pay off all their debts and ironically all their money from that was the exact amount to pay everything off. They live much happier than before. 

And now you see how money buys happiness. It's true. Money does buy happiness. There are so many situations where money will solve your problems. I'm not trying to say how it's the only cause of happiness: there are things that can make people happy without the use of money, but generally if you have money it'll make you happier. I know that many people with tons of money are also depressed, but when you get a middle aged mid income family paying off all their debts and still being mid income, they are happy. Why? Because money.

    <text>I know you're here to have your view changed, however I would have to argue that you're actually correct.

Money can buy happyness, you can invest it into making others happy, free up time and gather resources to study whatever you desire or travel the world, you're the master of your own time, you can spend as much time with your family as you would like, you can help to improve the world, you can fly around and get the best treatments from the best experts in medical fields, you can fund projects to shape the future, etc. etc. etc.

I guess the real point is that money can't make people happy that cannot handle money. There have been many documented cases in which winners of lotteries began to throw around their money like crazy only to end up where they've started or even worse and look back in regret. I personally know people who cannot handle money at all, as soon as they have a few bucks to them they think they're rich and buy on impulse whatever they desire only to end up in debt again.

Money cannot make people happy who cannot handle money, otherwise money is just about the most helpful tool in realizing ones own happyness.
