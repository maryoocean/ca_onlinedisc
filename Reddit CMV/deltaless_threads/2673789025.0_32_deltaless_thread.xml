    <title>CMV: The notion that the Democrats or Republicans "must" run Biden or Trump "because there are no other viable candidates" is ridiculous. There are thousands of people who would make better presidential candidates for 2024 than Biden or Trump.</title>

    <original_post>Every argument for Biden or Trump to run in 2024 boils down to some version of "status quo" or "inertia." We're told that the Ds and Rs have no choice but to run these super-old candidates because there's nobody else who could be suitable.

&amp;#x200B;

In a nation of 332,000,000 people, there are well over 100 million who are over the age of 35, American-born, and have resided in the United States for 14 years or more - in other words, are constitutionally eligible to run for president.

Out of those 100 million, surely at least half have a basic education, are mature, sensible, decent people, and have demonstrated solid character - and also be significantly younger than Trump or Biden.

Out of those 50 million, surely at least ten million would qualify as *highly* educated - the metrics of which can be tricky to figure out (is it a master's degree? or something else?) - but they would be significantly above average.

Out of those 10 million, surely at least one million would be quite exceptional - people who have substantially high IQ, have advanced quite far in life and a career - such as being a doctor, or having worked in public governmental service for decades, etc.

And out of those million, surely at least 10,000 would have the political know-how, the charisma, the political interest, maybe have spent significant time abroad in foreign countries or speak multiple languages, to be a suitable president.

In fact, even in Congress, state legislatures or governorships alone, there must be dozens of good, qualified, educated, experienced politicians who would be much younger than Trump or Biden, and who would make suitable presidential candidates. 

So, CMV on this one. I don't buy for one moment the notion that, in a nation of 332 million people, America somehow has no choice but to run Biden vs. Trump in 2024 because "we've got no one else who'd be a good candidate."  </original_post>

    <text>Because Americans don’t vote in the smaller elections, they only really vote during the General Election. This is why people think all we have are old guys working as politicians, Americans don’t vote during their city council elections, or gubernatorial, even primary elections don’t have the same level of participation.

So when you don’t bother to vote in the smaller elections, don’t expect things to change in the great big general election for the president. You want more people like AOC or younger politicians, you need to vote for them in your local cities and town halls. Political careers take a long time to grow a support base which is why it seems all you get are old people.

Sure, you can argue Americans don’t have time or that politicians have made it so the system discourages voting or diminishes the power of your vote (gerrymandering) but these are not hard barriers to voting. If you have any amount of free time, dedicate some of it to voting or make plans to make time to vote. That’s just being an adult and managing your time, and there’s plenty of Americans, progressive or conservative, with the time to vote who do so every election or make sacrifices to do so. 

It may be difficult or inconvenient to vote or make plans to make time to vote, but then I suppose that’s the same as saying voting isn’t worth my time and by extension, democracy isn’t worth my time.</text>
