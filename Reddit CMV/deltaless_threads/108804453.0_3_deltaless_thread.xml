    <title>I think the main reason to object to cars isn't pollution or gasoline, it's the space; the fact that gridlock happens at all is ridiculous. CMV.</title>

    <original_post>When I see most car-judging on the Internet, I see people mainly talking about tailpipe emissions and the environment, or else gasoline prices and international politics. Now I want to agree hastily that these are good, important things to worry about, but I'm not really worried about them, at least not in the long term. Cars are getting more fuel efficient, and hybrid cars are gaining market share, and eventually they'll run on some other energy source anyway. 

But cars are *not* getting significantly smaller, the brief Mini fad notwithstanding, and the population is growing.

My home city, Vancouver, is certainly not the worst North American city when it comes to traffic, and I think some people would even say we're comparatively pretty good. But still every morning, and every evening, for about 2 hours each, our downtown core and the major arteries of our city are full. Not completely jammed, but moving slowly, bumper-nearly-to-bumper, travelling at roughly the same average pace as a moderately-fit jogger.

They move this slowly because there are such-and-such many cars per kilometre of road, and because it would be unsafe to drive at/near the speed limit when the distance between cars is so short; no one has that kind of reaction time. And there are so many cars because, as a society, we have this thing where it is basically expected that every adult who has passed some tests, is entitled to occupy their own 4 or 5 meter rectangle of public road space to themselves, for as long as they need to. 

This is something which most city dwellers see as normal, and I can't seem to get anyone else to see this everyone-gets-a-car-or-at-least-most-people model of urban life as a completely absurd, ludicrous solution to a pretty simple engineering problem. The usefulness of everyone's car decreases slightly with each additional car there is on the road, and I feel like most medium-to-big cities are already at the point of diminishing returns, where additional cars slow down their neighbours by a greater margin than they provide their own driver, and so actually have *negative net utility.*

Does it make sense for people to use the same machine to traverse between cities (highway systems are *very* efficient!) as they use to cross town? If it does, CMV!</original_post>

As long as a car still gets you across town faster than a bus, this is irrelevant, at least to whoever's driving the car.

And honestly, either Vancouver is very backed up or you're greatly underestimating the speed advantage to driving.

Yeah, no, this is not true. I live in Chicago, and I've seen rush hour traffic before. It's not amazing, but it's never been as slow as a "moderately fit jogger". Speeds on large roads rarely dip below the *max sprinting speed of the fastest runner alive*, in fact.

Either you're underestimating how fast cars go or overestimating how fast people go. The fastest speed a human has ever ran for any distance at all is [slightly under 28 mph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footspeed). Jogging speed is 10ish mph.</text>

I think you've described a Tragedy of the Commons. I definitely don't purport to have an individually-incentivized solution to this problem; if it were that easy don't think we'd be in the mess we are now.

As for the specifics of driving speed, I can really only speak to my own route to/from work, which I guess must be particularly bad. Yesterday I watched the same jogger from the window of my bus for more than 5 blocks.</text>
