    <title>CMV: Public transportation should run 24/7.</title>
    <original_poster>Keep-reefer-illegal</original_poster>
    <original_post>We live in a world that is no longer 9-5. Businesses stay open later, friends can reach us with a portable device simply by typing on a mini keyboard. It doesn't make sense that public transportation isn't 24/7. Here are some reasons why it should be 24/7:

1. Very few buses run at 2 am for last call, I feel like if nothing else, running buses later let's responsible drunk people take public transit instead of driving home. 

2. It would benefit the working poor who may work night shift 

3. As mentioned before our world is now 24/7 

Those are my arguments. 

I encourage you all to change my view 

Edit: by transit I am including trains, buses, all forms of public transportation, not just buses.

    <text>Most people here are bringing up the cost issue. Here are some other factors to consider:

1) Not all cities have the same needs. Large cities like NYC clearly have the demand for 24/7 service, but smaller cities may not.  It also depends on how well the city is laid out; if the only economical way to run 24h service is to have limited routes on central corridors, it depends on how many "central corridors" your city actually has. A sprawling city with low population density is going to be much more difficult than a tightly-packed city with high density.

2) Bus drivers have rights too. If you think there will only be limited demand for 3am service, are you going to make bus drivers drive around largely-empty buses at 3am? If there is demand for it, sure, but the well-being of your own employees is important too.

3) Infrastructure costs can be an issue. It's relatively easy for a city with existing subway/tram/bus lines to add more trains/trams/buses. They may have to purchase more trains or buses, but that's essentially a one-time cost. But some cities don't have the infrastructure in place to begin with. Vancouver has an excellent train system (the SkyTrain) that is completely driverless, which is awesome, and makes it easy to offer 24h service. But the cost of building this train system was still a massive project to put in place, which some cities simply may not be able to afford. Subways and trains (in contrast to buses) make good 24h systems, but they can be enormously expensive for cities that don't already have lines in place.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of 24h service where possible. But to make a blanket statement about public transportation in general implies that all cities should do this. That's far too general a statement that fails to consider the specific needs and costs of individual cities. Not all cities have the population density, easy layout, and existing infrastructure of NYC.</text>
