    <title>CMV: If gender is a social construct, then so is race</title>
    <original_poster>BoppeBoye</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let us take, as a given, that gender is divorced from the circumstances of your birth, that it is not a mental illness, and that there is no biological basis for what gender identity someone should express. Have I phrased that effectively? I'm trying to be concise, but I want to portray that premise correctly.

Why, then, should race be different than gender? If race carries with it "shared experience" and "lived experience", etc - that assumes that the only way you could understand what it's like to be a minority is to have lived your entire life as that particular minority. I'm not arguing against that, I agree that there are certain experiences that I could not comprehend - for instance, overbearing &amp;amp; strict Asian parents with exceedingly high expectations. 

But, if someone can change their gender or decide (?) that they identify as a different gender without having the prior lived experience of said gender, then why can't someone identify as a different race?

I'm not able to encompass all the variables which could lead someone to identify as another gender, but is it not possible for someone to come to the same conclusion with their race? What if an Indian man grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood, saw or experienced the same (or similar) discrimination as them, had minimal exposure to Indian culture; and this led him to conclude that he identifies more closely as a black man, rather than Indian? 

I would also like to cite Rachel Dolezal, who was uniformly mocked for being (afaik) the first trans-black woman in the public eye. It seems similar to transgender discrimination to me, assuming that there is something wrong with her mentally for deciding to become a black woman... Anyway, I'm not really defending her because that's not really in line with what I described in the previous paragraph (she grew up privileged IIRC), but the public reaction of mockery goes against the leftist belief of acceptance, by my perspective.

So, in short, why can there be no such thing as trans-racial people, the same way there are transgender?

    <text>Honestly neither are social constructs. Race is a real biological fact. The amount of melatonin in your skin can be measured accurately determining one’s race. A scientist can look at the DNA of an individual and determine the individual’s race. So it is not a social construct. 

Gender is also not a social construct. Gender is a result of one’s sex, which is either male or female. There is no consistent third gender. Therefore, most people are men or women, this is not a social construct, it is a fact.</text>

    <text>You are incorrect about race. An albino black is still "black" according to the social construct for example. This is trivial example falsifying your statement but really when looking closely at the American concept of "race" the concept falls down scientifically. </text>

    <text>Listen I think you're missing the point. The person you replied to already knows that "racist" view or American concept of race is a construct; however, you actually prove their point more in showing that an albino person is technically still black genetically and is more likely to develop sickle cell anemia. Maybe the issue is people ascribe it too much to their current skin color only but not their genes. It could be more beneficial to learn their genetic makeup for reference instead of how society usually just blankets all darker skinned people. But I see what you're saying and I don't think the discussions in this thread are trying to incite ignorant racism but use logic to where maybe some people have failed to use it in more liberal communities.</text>

    <text>An albino is also light skinned genetically. As for sickle cell anemia they are 0% likely to have it if they don’t have the gene. Which most blacks do not afaik. 

That’s the point I think: “race” makes no sense scientifically when talking about humans. trying to imply it has some scientific basis is not helping anyone as it is factually incorrect. </text>

    <text>I see your point but classifications and stereotypes are actually very important in the field of epidemiology when dealing with populations and disease control. Asking rather non PC questions are at the heart of helping treat or reach  a community. It also helps you learn when connect certain patterns. Again I agree with you that it must be within reason, but in some instances I think live and let live. Comedians will always have something to make fun of, science can always pull from socially constructed patterns. It's not simple as to leave the discussion as "let's never mention this topic again".  Race can make sense when talking about humans if the statices say so. Just like when asked the question do you have sex with men, how often, did you have a dad, what was your income. Everything we do or construct we build has some validity in  "science" and it takes a long process or dance if you will to uncover helpful truths. 

But yes people think the wrong way about race on a grand scale. </text>

    <text>You’re still confused about the scientific viability of human races. It’s not “PC” to reject it. It’s what actually comes from looking at genetics and, as you mention it, epidemiology. The genetic diversity of African populations vastly outstrip that of all non-African populations together so epidemics suggest that there are thousands or tens of thousands of groups in Africa all as genetically descriptive as “Caucasian”. Yet I see no one claiming there are tens of thousands of black races and one white. Hell, people even say Jews are a race which is quite absurd. That’s what I mean by the concept of race being scientifically nonsense. </text>

    <text>I think you're misinterpreting what I said. I'm basically agreeing with you. And study epidemiology.</text>

    <text>Cool :P It’s hard to speak with precision about these things for sure. </text>
