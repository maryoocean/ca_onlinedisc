    <title>CMV: High school literature and history courses fail to provide meaningful educational value</title>
    <original_poster>dabears_24</original_poster>
    <original_post>In their current form, high school courses focused on history and literature fail to provide meaningful educational benefits. 

These classes commonly have a goal of improving critical thinking skills and develop advanced literacy. However, the format of current history courses where students heavily analyze past events, does not emphasize critical thinking, but rather focuses on memorization of history that has little to no significance in the present. Literature classes that focus on deep analysis of *important* texts like Shakespeare's works, complex poetry, or stylistic writing (i.e. stream-of-consciousness in "Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man") do not develop readinc/writing skills applicable to students' lives or modern texts. They also tend to foster dislike for reading when students are forced to extract meaning from texts they do not value or understand.

I believe a courses in debate, critical analysis of nonfiction works (i.e. argumentative opinion pieces), or even literary analysis of more familiar works would all be better alternatives to detailed US history or general literature courses.

Since this is a broad statement with caveats, I'll clarify in a list:

- I am not arguing the classes offer zero value. The concept of being in an educational environment likely has benefits itself, so my view will not be changed by arguments of the form "all education has value".


- I acknowledge the value of basic history lessons in understand society, culture, and history that affects us today. I am arguing that there is little to no value in all students having to learn of details like specific battles of the Civil War, or the politics of the early 1800s. These topics should be pursed electively.


- I am not arguing that these classes lack value only because they do not tie to future careers. I believe these two courses majorly fail to provide value. I agree that math and science courses do not necessarily tie into future work, but I believe they accomplish their goals more effectively.

I admit I may display a STEM-favoring bias due to my field of study and work, so I am willing to accept arguments that show that my view is a function solely of my bias and not of reason.

EDIT: Want to clarify that I still think history should be taught at a general level in school. I don't think it should be as detailed or exhaustive as a part of the core curriculum. In other words, I think the necessary history can be taught in fewer total classes

EDIT 2: Pretty late in the cycle now, but I'll add this regardless since I've engaged with a lot of arguments that misinterpret my post. I am not arguing against the value of History and Literature. I am saying these classes are ineffective in their current forms</original_post>

    <text>On the literature bit:  not all books are worth analyzing.  Some authors actually put some depth and meaning into their works and put clues about those things throughout.  Most authors don’t.  So if those clues aren’t written into the text then there is no amount of stating at it that will make them appear so you can write about them.

For example, there is a book called Lolita about a pedophile who kidnaps a girl and goes on a road trip with her.  The book is written from the pedophile’s point of view.  This is a book with a lot of clues snuck in here and there so you can piece together what’s really going on (because the pedo narrator really isn’t going to tell everything straight).  One thing that goes on through the book is the girl is squinting at things when she tries to read, for example, when she looks at a menu.  Little detail that goes on throughout the story.  At the end she gets away, finds a husband and starts living her life.  The pedo tracks her down and so you get to see how she turns out, and one of the details at the end is that she is wearing glasses.  So you can take from that detail that she couldn’t see very well throughout the story and the pedo (who claimed he loved her and all that) wasn’t picking up on it, which you can interpret as him definitely not really taking care of her (as he claims he is).  

I’m in a book club and we read a variety of books of different qualities.  And I can tell you straight up: most books, even ones with enjoyable stories, don’t have clues like this included so there’s nothing to discover or, frankly, talk about with your book club. 

That’s why English teachers choose the books they do.</text>
