    <original_post>That is to say, if real Christians ever existed in the first place. If you are a Christian, you must follow the teachings of the bible. You must follow the teachings of Christ. A real follower of any religion should follow that religion, not pick and choose what bits interest them. As soon as you can say "this works" and "this doesn't", you're not following the rules!

I believe anyone who works on the Sabbath, has piercings or tattoos, wears cotton/polyester blends, has a same-sex relationship, allows a woman to teach, or allows a woman to speak in church, etc. And says they're a Christian is lying.

I am certainly not saying that anyone should actually follow these rules, but I am convinced you are simply being dishonest if you call yourself a Christian, or a member of any religion, without following the rules that were clearly put out to you under that religion. Anyone that chooses to nit-pick the parts of their religion that they choose to follow is nothing more than a deist with a book they like. You are not a follower unless you are a follower!

Update: Between /u/TheophilusOmega and /u/Ausfall my view has changed. I feel the easiest way for me to word this is my analogy that the Bible is not a rulebook to Christians, but a textbook. They don't follow it to a T because they don't have to. Jesus' teachings is the lesson, and the Bible is the textbook in which his teachings and the Biblical historical relevance is told. Assuming that a Christian must follow the rules of the Bible exactly, else they are not a 'true' believer, is fallacious reasoning as shown by /u/ausfall, and between the two of them I've learned what actually separates following the Holy Book to following the Religion itself. I feel the points were put across strongest and clearest by these two Redditors, but thank you to everyone else who contributed.</original_post>

At least some of those specific laws come from Leviticus. They are old testament laws and thus null and void in Christianity. Anyone who DOES follow rules from Leviticus is actually not a Christian *italics*(On top of that, in Judaism, it was originally only supposed to apply to the Levite tribe. The word literally means relating to the Levites. they were the Priestly Tribe, hence the long list of rules they had to follow. It was only later someone decided to apply it to everyone else).*italics*

I digress though. Jesus came and brought an end to the old covenant ("I came to fulfill the laws"), which included all those Old Testament laws. Pretty much the only ones applicable within the New Covenant are the 10 commandments. And we can certainly debate whether Christians, or "christians", are any good at even following those, but point is, we can't hold it against them for not following Leviticus, since really, they aren't supposed to. 
So whenever a Christian throws Leviticus at you to justify their anti-whatever view, point out they are a bad Christian for it. :)</text>
