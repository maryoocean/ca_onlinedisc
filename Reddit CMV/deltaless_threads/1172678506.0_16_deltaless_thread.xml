    <title>CMV: Human Life has no innate worth due to the Laws of Supply and Demand</title>

&amp;amp;nbsp;

So first I'd like to define the difference between Human Life and a Human Being. My premise rests on defining the two separately. Let me assure you that I feel that a Human Being with a developed consciousness is irreplaceable. However, due to the recent surge in discussions on abortion, I've been hammering out the details on a premise I'd like to present here in an effort to determine any flaws in it: **Human Life has no innate value, as there are over 7 billion humans on this planet, and the Laws of Supply and Demand dictate that an unborn child therefore only holds subjective worth.**


I noticed that many people seem to innately assume that unborn children are a highly valuable commodity, which confuses me, as any of 2-4 billion women could essentially produce billions more embryos at any given time. While a specific embryo or fetus can absolutely hold subjective value to a person, which is why I support laws that punish the murder of a pregnant person as though it was a double homicide, I don't see the issue with a person choosing to rid themselves of an unwanted pregnancy; nothing of inherent or subjective value was lost. While I'm not a fan of abortions used as matter of convenience (I'd much prefer universal healthcare and a robust Sex Ed curriculum), I see an abortion as nothing more than a medical procedure with no morality involved any more than a kidney transplant is "moral."

    <text>In order for supply and demand to exist, humans must exist. Therefore, humans innately hold more value than the entire concept of supply and demand. Humans can also just simply reject the entire concept of supply and demand because it itself is a made up construct to define and explain behavior humans engage in. 


Also, if humans can only hold subjective value, all goods also hold only subjective value. Water could be worth a million dollars to somebody dying in the desert, or nothing to somebody drowning in a lake. 


So the phrase "Human Life has no innate value" is meaningless as NOTHING has innate value.


Also - you're deciding the subjective value of a human before they've had a chance to be adequately and fully be evaluated. If we assume subjective value is the way to go with judging people, the subjective value of "me" is the *totality of my past, current, and future life in the eyes of myself and others.* By judging the "subjective value" prematurely before a baby is even born, you make it impossible to correctly assess them. You're presupposing something isn't worth anything with zero evidence to back up that decision.


However, that's entirely beside the point has you're trying to turn human beings into 1s and 0s with an economic model that ignores morality and humanity. You'll never end up with a "valid method" by doing that.</text>
