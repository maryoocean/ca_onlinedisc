    <title>CMV: Municipalities should not hold easily politicized elections for apolitical positions like sheriff.</title>

    <original_post>I see a lot about sheriffs being appointed through local elections, even seeing people wearing tshirts that say "Re-elect [sheriff's name] for [county name] county sheriff". But to me that seems to politicize a position that is one of considerable power to enforce the law in the area. By politicizing that, a sheriff is able to impose a political agenda to the point where it is literally able to be enforced at gunpoint, and can appoint deputies that align with them. While it makes towns essentially an absolute in terms of political alignment, it also insulates them to changes going on around them, including in surrounding towns or cities, and ultimately stifles progress and lets them get away with things that regular public officials wouldn't get away with because they are essentially their own oversight committee, like we saw with Joe Arpaio.</original_post>

    <text>Traditionally, the people's power to elect the sheriff was a significant check on the power of the court to abuse the public.  During Jim Crow, law enforcement was handled mostly at the county level, and the inability of African Americans to vote for sheriff was the cornerstone of oppression.  This isn't a flaw with the fact that the office is elected, but rather with unequal voting rights.  Perhaps this is archaic today, but traditionally, the sheriff was the chief law enforcement official, outside of a few big cities.  The power to elect that official was extremely meaningful.</text>
