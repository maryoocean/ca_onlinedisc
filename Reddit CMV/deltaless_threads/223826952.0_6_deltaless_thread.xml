    <title>CMV: College Athletes are modern day indentured servants and deserve to be paid.</title>
    <original_poster>yobittner</original_poster>
    <original_post>It’s about time we start paying student athletes, or at the very least grant all participants full scholarships. Coming from a Division I athlete myself, I never really thought of the subject until undergoing the most stressful past few months of my life. If being a student isn’t enough, try waking up by 8am for your first class, finishing around one, and then going to practice for 4-5 hours. After practice, you grab a bite to eat and by the team you even have a chance of starting your course work, the clock says 8pm. It’s looking like an all-nighter, oh wait that’s every other night, and you are already exhausted from practice.

According to Forbes, the NCAA basketball tournament, also known as “March Madness,” allows for CBS to make more than $1 billion off the games. Athletic conferences receive millions of dollars from the NCAA when their teams make it far in the tournament. It is even estimated that as a whole the NCAA makes $6 billion annually. (It’s registered as a non-profit by the way…) Meanwhile student athletes are either going in debt to pay for school, barely have any spending money, or are just fortunate enough to be one of the few that are financially well off. Quite frankly, I feel as though it’s just not fair that an organization can make so much money off of people who don’t receive any benefits. Its modern day indentured servitude.

You can only look back at the video game dilemma to see how much the NCAA generates off of unpaid workers. NCAA Football and March Madness were discontinued after athletes found players that looked exactly like them. Although names were not able to be used, the NCAA would not only have someone on the cover, but have identical players in the game. There was a settlement in which the game was finally discontinued because of the outrageous greed by a nonprofit organization.

One logical argument that’s often ignored is that an athlete can be compared to a cafeteria worker in a university dining hall. Both represent the school and provide a service that generates money. However, the only one who is paid is the cafeteria worker. Does that make any sense? Why would someone that generates less money for the school receive better treatment? It’s common sense…

At the very least, I believe all NCAA athletes should be eligible for full scholarships. There shouldn’t be any limitations at all. You would be very surprised to realize that actually the majority of NCAA student athletes do not receive any sort of athletic financial aid. A lot of this has to do with the limitation on the number of scholarships per team due to policies such as Title IX. Not only are you paying the school through your hard work, but you also might be literally paying the school…

    <text>I think they should be paid if there likeness is used or their image/name is used for merchandise or marketing, but they shouldn't be paid just to play.  They are not obligated to play, they get benefits for playing and an incredible amount of support.  They get a free education, a stipend, and they get an opportunity to make millions of dollars if they are drafted.  It's a pretty sweet deal, it just sucks if you compare it to professional athletes.

Again, though, the idea that they lose the rights to their own likeness is ridiculous.</text>
