    <title>CMV: I'm wasting my time and money by going on vacation overseas.</title>
    <original_poster>beq451991</original_poster>
    <original_post>I am a somewhat recent college graduate and am about to take my first trip overseas, to Italy. I have a full-time job and am taking two weeks off for this trip. Now that the trip is coming up in a couple weeks, I am wondering why I thought it would be a good idea. I don't like the idea of two weeks of not being able to workout in a gym, eating decadent food, and spending as much money as I am on the trip. I am the stereotypical American who actually likes working and I try to work more hours than other people, punishing myself in the gym (if I'm not sore after lifting weights or out of breath after cardio, it's not a workout), and eating simple foods. I am going on this trip mainly for the historical aspect, but I am afraid of living too softly and enjoying myself too much, as ridiculous as that sounds. People tell me I'm going to work myself to an early death, but I see working as my purpose in life, as a man. I don't care if I drop dead from a heart attack at 40 if I worked as hard as I could and accomplished as much as possible.</original_post>

    <text>Tailor your trip to what you want.  Don't do what you think others expect of you, but what you think you will enjoy the most.

If you like working out, run through the town or bike up the mountains. It's a great way to see an area - I almost always go for a few nice runs in a new place when I'm traveling.  And find a hotel with a gym and work out there if you want - there's no rule that you have to spend the entire trip sightseeing.

If you like simple foods, go ahead and eat them.  You can have meals of meat (mmm...proscuitto), bread and cheese if you want. If you don't want to spend big money on fancy meals at restaurants, then don't.  Grab something from a supermarket and eat it outside somewhere nice.

If you don't want to spend money, spend your time doing free activities like walking around historic towns and hiking in beautiful areas.  </text>
