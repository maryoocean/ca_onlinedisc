    <title>CMV: American cities are terribly designed and administered compared with European cities.</title>
    <original_poster>bostoninwinston</original_poster>
    <original_post>Most American cities are terrible compared to European ones. I'm not talking about big cities like NYC or SF- I mean the typical- the average- American city- is just awful by any objective comparison. You can go to out of the way cities in Italy or France, Germany or Belgium, and they build places as though their great-grandchildren would be proud to live there. Here, the average city has no city center, major monuments, or sense of history. In the US. there are few places to gather. The social life of American cities is incomparably lifeless compared to European cities. Our Cities are heavily segregated by race and economic class in the way European cities aren't. The architecture here is mostly corporatist modernism, and looks cookie-cutter. It quickly gets dated in the way the art of European cities don't. People here have to get around by car, and as a result are fatter and live shorter lives than the average European. Our unhealthiness contributes to our under-productivity. The average European city is vastly more productive than the average American one – despite Europeans having dramatically more benefits, time off, vacations in, and shorter work hours on average. We damage our environment far more readily than European cities do. Our cities are designed often in conflict with the rule areas that surround them, whereas many European cities are built integrated into their environment. We spend more money on useless junk thank Europeans do. Our food isn't as good quality. Our water is often poisoned with lead and arsenic, and our storm drainage systems are easily overrun compared to European water management systems.  European cities are managing rising seas and the problems related to smog far better than American cities are. 

I can't think of a single way in which American cities are broadly speaking superior to European ones. Change my view.</original_post>

    <text>Hi, just saw this in r/all and as someone who lives in an 'average' American city just out of Portland, Oregon, I thought I'd try to change your opinion.
I'm sure you've heard all about America being built for cars with a grid layout, so I'm not going to go over that.
For city centers, our city's center doesn't have much history (the town itself probably isn't even 100 years old), but it it definitely serves its purpose as a gathering place. We have a nice library with lots of plazas and a park nearby. The roads are lined with all types of shops and restaurants and are all pedestrian-accessible, and this is all within a 20 minute bike ride from where I live. 
The only major pollution we get is smoke from forest fires in the summer
As for diversity, a large portion of our town is Hispanic.
For water being poisoned, it differs depending on where you are. Here in Oregon our water has no taste at all, but I do think that California water tastes weird. It's probably not poisoned though.
We rarely have any problem with storms or have any drainage issues.
The community in our town has always been very close and growing up I've done many community service jobs. This is just my experience, I can't compare America to Europe very well because I still haven't visited but I hope this sheds some light about what I would consider an 'average' American city.</text>

    <text>I have not been to Portland yet – I would love to go – but from what I can tell it seems like Portland is a truly exceptional American city. The greenways, the transit oriented design, and everything you just described sounds absolutely fantastic. I think like New York, Chicago, Alexandria, and a few other examples listed here – these places have more in common with cities in Europe like Munich, Turin, and Nice, than Dallas, Shreveport, Sevierville, or Cleveland. Perhaps this is a mistaken impression, but either way I'm still looking forward to visiting Portland someday.
Thanks for your post!</text>
