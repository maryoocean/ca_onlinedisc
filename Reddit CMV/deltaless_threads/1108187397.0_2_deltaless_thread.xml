    <title>CMV: voting for the president is pointless</title>
    <original_poster>TheRealPifftastic</original_poster>
    <original_post>The reason I feel this way is because of the electoral college.  The popular vote hasn't been used to elect a president since sometime in the 1800's. Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 2.8 million in 2016.All of the "get out and vote" sentiments are such a waste of time,money, and effort.  I do vote in local/state issues and politicians, because that really is the power of the people in action. All of my friends think I'm missing the point, and I may be. I really feel that out political system is deeply flawed. From all the special interests groups and lobbyists to tax breaks for multi million dollar companies that don't pay American taxes or pay a livable wage to the workers. I feel that nothing can change until the power of the people rule the country and not 538 voters that are easily swayed by greed.</original_post>

    <text>Flawed: sure I'd agree with that.

Pointless: not at all.  Even if you dislike the electoral college, they still (almost always) follow the will of the voters they represent.  I agree it sucks that the system allows someone to win without getting the popular vote.  But voting is what determines the president, so it can't be pointless.</text>

    <text>Typically the popular vote and the electoral college votes don't line up. Few presidents win both, Obama was the last one in a memorable lifetime.</text>

    <text>*Most* presidents win both. 29/31 of the last election they have lined up. I think you might be confused as to how important the actual 528 electors are vs the importance of voters in close states.</text>
