    <title>CMV: it is a jerk move to play music while camping within earshot of other campers.</title>
    <original_poster>estheredna</original_poster>
    <original_post>We put a tent up in a state park campground for about 4 weeks out of the summer. Most of the time you can just hear nature, people talking, kids playing, lots of birds and squirrels  . Every 5th day or so, there is someone who brings some Bluetooth speakers so they can listen to music , but loud  enough  that people in a half dozen sites nearby get to ‘enjoy’ whatever they are playing. 

Right now I’m cooking dinner and the guys next to me are playing U2, Dave Matthew Band and similar inoffensive crap.

This would be entirely normal in a backyard gathering, but once you reserve to be in a public campground, it becomes selfish, intrusive,  rude.

Am I wrong?

(I know it’s a known risk of car camping. I’m not really  mad. More rolling my eyes. I wish they’d shut that crap off.  )

    <text>What do you expect to be a 'reasonable level of privacy' when camping at a state park mere meters from other people? I prefer to swim alone. That said, I don't go to the municipal pool and then complain on the internet about how many idiot kids that are there. 

The real issue here is you think you are out in nature, when in reality, you just want the illusion of nature. If you actually wanted to be in nature, you wouldn't go to a parking lot with grass, fire-pits, and electrical outlets. They are not being jerks, you are being entitled/selfish because you believe everyone around you should camp like you do. I'm sure both parties were made aware of the camping rules at said state park before they pitched their tents. As long as the other campers are following those rules, you really don't have anything to complain about. 

I prefer the seat next to me on an airplane be vacant, but if someone bought that ticket, it's really not right for me to call them a jerk, or be angry with them because they are "hurting my flying experience." </text>
