    <title>CMV: Christianity is held together through fear</title>
    <original_poster>M1STER_B0NES</original_poster>
    <original_post>My opinion is that if the fear of going to Hell was not present in the Christian ideology, then most of the followers of the religion would not be there.

Before I decided I was agnostic, that was my only reason for continuing to identify with the religion. Then, I decided I wasn't going to let fear control me. 

All in all, I don't see how this is any different than blackmailing a person to do what you want. You present your instruction, then tell them how you will completely devastate their life if they do not follow through.</original_post>

    <text>That is also my opinion. I was raised Christian, so I always have that fear of hell in death. If there is no punishment, you can live a free life and HAVE FUN. I would love that.</text>

    <text>Might sound weird but I think it’s best to embrace that hell exists as it can become quite impossible to stop believing. What I find though is that I live freely and accept that maybe I’ll go to hell once I’m dead and honestly I’m okay with that because I didn’t live bound in chains. I think another thing to ask yourself is the consequence of going to hell worse than living in fear 24/7? </text>
