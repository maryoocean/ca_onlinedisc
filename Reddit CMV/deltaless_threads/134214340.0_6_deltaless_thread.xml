    <title>CMV: I Believe a Sustainable Market for Video Games Oriented Towards Women Exists, and that Feminism Would Be Better Served to Develop For It Than Merely Complain About It</title>
    <original_poster>OhCrapADinosaur</original_poster>
    <original_post>E3 took place the past couple of days, and of the various bits of news from the event, Ubisoft announced their Assassin's Creed title. I'm wholly indifferent to the Assassin's Creed games, but apparently this game features 4 person local multiplayer and only includes a slate of male characters. As a result of this news, some of my feminist former-friends posted articles to this effect: http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/11/5799386/no-female-characters-in-assassins-creed-unity-too-much-work

I'm not going to weigh in on the truth of Ubisoft's claims particularly, whether or not their claims were justified, or whether any of the views held by either side is right and just. The general consensus among the feminism crowd seemed to be along the lines that:

* 1. There are many sexist stereotypes prevalent in video games, possibly moreso in mainstream titles, and particularly noticed (by the feminists) are those stereotypes concerning women.
* 2. There is a large and substantial base of female gamers, many of whom would presumably enjoy games that break stereotypes and employ strong female lead characters
* 3. Many popular games today don't necessarily serve female gamers so well

I'm not going to suggest that feminists shouldn't complain (well, I might a little), but from my vantage point that's pretty much all I see get done. If you actually believe 1, 2, and 3 above, then there might be a GOLDEN MARKET OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU and you should invest your ranting energy into developing for this female gamer market (it's also overwhelmingly likely that this is, in fact, already being done and I'm just not particularly aware of it). Barriers to entry have probably never been lower to go develop for almost any platform you like, and indy games that hit it big have the opportunity to hit it REALLY big. You could make the video game equivalent of "Orange is the New Black" and have millions of loving, adoring fans who will cheer and talk about how you helped bring women into the video game mainstream. And hey, money!

Sadly, this attitude didn't much win over my feminist friends, who more or less told me to shut up and go fuck myself. So... yeah, I fail to see the problem with my thinking. Anybody want to help me out?

    <text>So I, as a woman who wants to see more women in video games, should go make my own video games -- when coding is not my thing at all and it would take years to learn, plus money that I frankly don't have -- instead of being allowed to say "When Ubisoft claims it would have doubled their production time to add a playable female character the math doesn't work out, that's BS"?</text>

    <text>Yeah this is a common double standard I see. People always tell me, "want less sexist movies, videogames, etc. etc. then go make some!" Yeah. Super realistic. I'll drop everything to make those. I'm allowed to complain about sexism and advocate for change.</text>

    <text>No one expects you to ever actually make the game yourself, but to realize it would be a huge waste of your time that very few people would want to play and likely would cost you more than you gain from the endeavor.

They want you to realize for yourself why those games don't already exist.</text>

    <text>Are you really saying nobody would buy games starring female protagonists? Or games where you can choose between a male and a female protagonist? Because Tomb Raider, Metroid, and freakin' Pokemon would like to have a word with you.</text>

    <text>Are you saying that men are making sexist videogames out of spite towards little girls? Becuase I can shove words into your mouth as well.

If you can't properly solve the utterly complex riddle that is my previous comment, I don't feel compelled to change your view.</text>

You realize that it would be due to lack of funding, skill, experience, and marketing rather than the fact that it wasn't sexist which would be the reason for this right? That claiming making a non-sexist game/movie/etc. won't automatically fail by virtue of it being non-sexist.</text>

Or do you suppose these companies are overtly anti-woman?</text>

Actually, no. I realize that if *they believe it would increase sales* then the companies would stop releasing sexist games. The problem is one of perception. They don't believe it would increase sales, the point everyone else is making is that it would.</text>

    <text>Really?  You don't think billion dollar entertainment companies do market research?

I'm afraid we're at an impasse.</text>

    <text>I think that billion dollar entertainment companies do shitty research and read into it what they will, while ignoring public research. Not to mention that the research isn't cut and dry and they simply don't want to take a chance, or attribute the failure of a game to the female protagonist even if the game failed because it was a shitty game rather than due to having a female protagonist.

However most cases of making a game non sexist are trivial and would cost the company nothing as they are just design decisions, such as Ubisoft putting no female model assassins in Unity.</text>

    <text>He means you have to code your own female-centered games, which is a flawed argument but is still being upvoted. I'm going to leave now.

Edit: Nevermind, he probably meant not 'funding' antifeminist games with your wallet. </text>

    <text>Game devs have all the problems you've listed. They didn't spring from the womb with leet coding skills and millions of dollars to finance their games. They didn't have perfect inspiration and execution of flawless ideas that the gaming public was screaming to buy.

Game devs are exactly like you in the beginning, the only difference being that they have a vision, and they aren't quitters.

Most of them will fail, and fail terribly. That's the cost of doing business, and of creative endeavour. I failed at game dev - I was involved in a game that made it to production as a 'B side' game on the AmigaCD32 (Why yes, I am old). Objectively, the game was crap. I was proud of what I did anyway - because I achieved more than what 90% of devs do.

Today, it is trivial to dev games. Go and download [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) and see what you can make. I'm not about to say that making games is easy, but it is easier than it has ever been before. The limit is no longer the coding really, it's having the ideas, the artwork, etc.

If your only reasons for not trying are *too hard/not interested/won't put in the time or effort* then I really don't see why I should take you seriously as anything more than an armchair critic. What are your qualifications for criticism other than being female (and presumably a feminist)? What points are you making that haven't been said before? You bring me a meaty argument and I'll gladly eat it.

I completely understand where Ubisoft is coming from. The excuse is probably horseshit, the reality is that they aren't damaging their market in any way by not including playable females. Ubi is a business first^(1), they are going to do what makes them the most money - not what pleases a vocal minority. Unnecessary dev time is exactly that.

At a certain point, critics must accept that games don't magic themselves out of thin air just because they put out another outraged blog post. I want the people complaining to do something, to make games, because I believe gaming will be better with their contributions as a part of it - I want them to succeed. What I *don't* want is to listen to their excuses about why it's all too hard - that's quitter talk and I've no time for it^(2).

There's absolutely no reason that women, feminists, or anyone cannot dev games if that is what they want to do. If there are no or few feminist/female friendly games then the logical thing to do is to make one - that's how the problem gets solved, not by whinging from the sidelines. Nobody cares what those that won't do think.

---
1) Assassin's Creed cost $20M in 2007 to dev. Assassin's Creed 2 cost $24M in 2009. Assassin's Creed:Unity will likely cost an insane amount to produce (successful series always have more cash thrown at them) and all that money must be made back in sales. No risks will be taken.

2) Because women are my equals, so if I can do it when it was 10 times harder than it is today, then what's stopping them? Get out and dev and make the change you want to see. You can do it - and don't let anyone tell you you can't (especially your fellow women - because I hear the 'I can't' from them so much I'm sick of it. Yes you can. Stop making excuses for yourselves).</text>
