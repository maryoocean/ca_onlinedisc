    <title>CMV: There is no reason a “God” should give Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>Protagoras67</original_poster>
    <original_post>I want to disclose that I am both an atheist and a hard determinist. I do not believe in any sort of creator and I have a hard time believing in Free Will. From what I understand from a Christian perspective, God gives humans free will in an effort to test them. But what i don’t understand from their point of view is why would God do that in the first place? Isn’t God omnipotent? God could just design the universe however it wants, we could have all been programmed to behave a certain way from birth and believe in God from birth and follow one religion as opposed to having a myriad of them. There is no reason to test us, it’s completely unnecessary.

Again, I’m not challenging anyone to prove God exists, I am just trying to understand the theological logic of this.</original_post>

    <text>If God is real, and his struggle with an adversary is real, part of the way God proves his righteousness to the universe is by giving people the freedom to do what is wrong.  Without it no one can choose to do what is right and no one in the universe would be able to really come to the understanding that God's way really is the right way.  

Christians believe that free will is a blessing from God, not unlike allowing you to be tempted.  These are opportunities to prove your love of God, trust in God and to prove your righteousness to yourself.</text>
