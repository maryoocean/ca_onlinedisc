    <title>META: Clarifying our stance on "Trojan Horse" CMVs</title>
    <original_poster>Poo-et</original_poster>
    <original_post>There has been uptick somewhat recently of posts where OP makes a claim that they do not believe in order to make a thinly veiled attack on something else entirely. This is usually done to illustrate a double standard they feel a certain group has. We would like to remind all posters of rule B which states *"You must personally hold the view"* and say that going forward we will be removing these posts on sight where they appear.  

These "trojan" posts are not suited to CMV because defeating the claim rarely results in a delta and merely unlocks the real view. There's also a lot of marginal rule 3 content that goes in the comment sections which probably should be avoided. I would advise posters to simply report and move on when you see one of these posts.  

You can talk about double standards in your CMV post, but you must make the positive claim you really believe in as part of that. 

If you have questions or more suggestions for the subreddit, I recommend forwarding them to r/ideasforcmv which the mod team is very active on.  

Thanks for making this place cool.</original_post>

    <text>Thank god you’re doing something about it. /r/NeutralPolitics /r/PoliticalDiscussion and /r/ChangeMyView have all been plagued since November by bad faith arguments, blatant agitation and JAQing off (Just Asking Questions).

Best of luck and it’s brave to take a proactive action like this but I have very little optimism that it will do anything to fix the more general problem, which is the increasing trend of the general public to self-radicalize and identify themselves and others exclusively as partisans.

TLDR: Anecdotally, an increasing amount of Americans are valuing abstract political goals and group identities more than preserving our existing official and unofficial places of discussion and mediation. 

IE: People are beginning to leave the table.</text>
