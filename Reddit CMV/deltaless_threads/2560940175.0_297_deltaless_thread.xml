    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>Whatever happened to the good ol' term: Yankee. I know a lot of Yankees don't like it cuz they associate it with New York or NE USA more broadly, but Canadians and Brits have been using that term to refer to all yanks for generations. To me (Canadian) a Californian is just as much a Yankee Doodle Dandy as a baseball fan in the big Apple.</text>
