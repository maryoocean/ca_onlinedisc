    <title>I believe the courting process should be eliminated entirely from sex, CMV.</title>

    <original_post>I don’t think that pursuing someone solely for the purpose of having sex with them, even if you don’t know them intimately, should be cause for judgment. Proposing sex to a friend, acquaintance, or stranger with no intentions of furthering an emotional connection or relationship should be acceptable. I believe our society has a strange and harmful dichotomy of attitudes towards sex - it saturates so much of our culture but is somewhat taboo on an interpersonal basis. I think that any limitations on sexual expression and release among consenting adults are harmful and cause unnecessary stress, and our society would benefit from fostering a more relaxed attitude towards sexual intimacy overall. 

tl;dr Casual sex should be acceptable and encouraged.</original_post>

    <text>I could be way off base, but I view monogamous relationships as one of several successful ways to pass on genetic material at the evolutionary time scale. I wouldn't be so quick to get rid of them. They may be more important than we understand. 

Also, having sowed  my wild oats in my twenties, I'm now in my late thirties, a parent, and in a monogamous relationship. I'm happier and more fulfilled than I ever was when I was very well sexed and single. Not only do perspectives vary between individuals, but the same individual can change perspectives as circumstances change.</text>
