    <title>CMV: The notion that the Democrats or Republicans "must" run Biden or Trump "because there are no other viable candidates" is ridiculous. There are thousands of people who would make better presidential candidates for 2024 than Biden or Trump.</title>

    <original_post>Every argument for Biden or Trump to run in 2024 boils down to some version of "status quo" or "inertia." We're told that the Ds and Rs have no choice but to run these super-old candidates because there's nobody else who could be suitable.

&amp;#x200B;

In a nation of 332,000,000 people, there are well over 100 million who are over the age of 35, American-born, and have resided in the United States for 14 years or more - in other words, are constitutionally eligible to run for president.

Out of those 100 million, surely at least half have a basic education, are mature, sensible, decent people, and have demonstrated solid character - and also be significantly younger than Trump or Biden.

Out of those 50 million, surely at least ten million would qualify as *highly* educated - the metrics of which can be tricky to figure out (is it a master's degree? or something else?) - but they would be significantly above average.

Out of those 10 million, surely at least one million would be quite exceptional - people who have substantially high IQ, have advanced quite far in life and a career - such as being a doctor, or having worked in public governmental service for decades, etc.

And out of those million, surely at least 10,000 would have the political know-how, the charisma, the political interest, maybe have spent significant time abroad in foreign countries or speak multiple languages, to be a suitable president.

In fact, even in Congress, state legislatures or governorships alone, there must be dozens of good, qualified, educated, experienced politicians who would be much younger than Trump or Biden, and who would make suitable presidential candidates. 

So, CMV on this one. I don't buy for one moment the notion that, in a nation of 332 million people, America somehow has no choice but to run Biden vs. Trump in 2024 because "we've got no one else who'd be a good candidate."  </original_post>

    <text>1. The deadline to file in the primaries is passed. There will be no more democratic primary candidates. Hypothetically the party could nominate someone different during the convention but I'm not sure how good that would look.
2. "Viable" means "can get enough votes to win." You're talking about who would be *qualified* for office. Totally different things.
3. The DNC is not in charge of "running Biden," he is. The only thing the DNC can do is to publicly dump Biden by supporting an alternative candidate running in the primaries. Because there are no viable candidates to beat Biden in a primary, and because it would cause an immense amount of acrimony and probably depress turnout in the general election which Biden is likely to be the nominee for anyways, they aren't doing it.
4. As for Trump, are you not aware of the Republican primary? There are tons of other candidates running. Currently polling shows them running about 1,000 miles behind Trump in terms of popularity with Republicans. Republicans will vote and choose their candidate within 6 months and it will likely be Trump because thats who they want to vote for.</text>
