    <title>CMV: It's fair to compare carnists (people who eat meat) to nazis.</title>
    <original_poster>Arkenhiem651</original_poster>
    <original_post>1) Carnists think that animals are inferior; Nazis think that jews are inferior
2) Carnists put animals in camps; Nazis put jews in camps
3) Both jews and animals attempt to escape
4) Both are/were normalized. Anyone who goes against these beliefs were/are suppressed and treated as illogical/emotionally driven
5) Both are unnecessary 
6) Both are/were driven long distances and murdered
7) emotional detachment from the victims
8) Both are sentient
Alex Hershaft a holocaust survivor also used this comparison along with other vegan holocaust survivors.
"We're focusing on the victims rather than the cancer of oppression itself",[8] and that "I noted with horror the striking similarities between what the Nazis did to my family and my people, and what we do to animals we raise for food: the branding or tattooing of serial numbers to identify victims, the use of cattle cars to transport victims to their death, the crowded housing of victims in wood crates, the arbitrary designation of who lives and who dies — the Christian lives, the Jew dies; the dog lives, the pig dies."[6

Also Alex Hershshaft looks extremely young considering he's 88 and survived concentration camps. That's irrelevant but I thought it interesting enough to mention considering he claims it's due to his vegan diet.

Edit: I know I say Jews but this also applies to other victims of the concentration camps such as Slavic peoples, gays and communists</original_post>

    <text>There’s at least one important difference: animals haven’t been given the questionable gift of knowing their own mortality. The unfathomable terror and psychological torture associated with the continual threat of demise (not just danger, but annihilation) experienced by a human in a concentration camp shouldn’t be discounted, nor should it be equated with the stress of an animal that may or may not sense danger in an abattoir.</text>

    <text>Not according to the article you linked. This article is about a *debate* regarding whether [certain] animals are capable of mourning. [But, being capable of mourning does not imply a conceptual awareness of one’s own mortality.]

From the article:

“The essays [that the article’s author references] don't focus on what a dying individual [i.e., an animal] might know about themselves.”

And, “they [i.e., animals] may not conceptualize death in the ways that many, or most, humans do”.

**Edit**: it’s also worth pointing out that this article is not relevant to animals like chickens or fish or, more generally, animals that are typically bred for slaughter.

**Edit2**: clarification</text>
