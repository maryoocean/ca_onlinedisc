    <title>CMV: The "no one is illegal" response is unjustified virtue signaling and the term "undocumented immigrant" is misleading.</title>
    <original_poster>snogo</original_poster>
    <original_post>I understand that there are sensitivities that need to be taken when referring to people who built their entire lives around an illegal act, but nobody cares when we characterize other people as "illegal" due to other illegal acts.

If I illegally dump toxic waste in the local river, I may very well be referred to as an illegal dumper. If I illegally sell cigarettes in the park, I may very well be referred to as an illegal seller. If I illegally grow marijuana in a legal state where a distinction is necessary, I may very well be referred to as an illegal grower.

The only time referring to someone as an "illegal X" gets people riled up is when you are referring to people who immigrated illegally.

This leads to whitewashed terms like "undocumented immigrant" which sounds like there was no illegal act performed. The term "undocumented immigrant" sounds to the uninformed observer like someone who is just like any other legal immigrant but whose immigration was undocumented due to a mishap in paperwork.

It wasn't simply an "undocumented immigration", it was an unauthorized, or illegal immigration.

The big difference is that while undocumented immigration is technically just as illegal as dumping, under most moral frameworks (e.g. utilitarianism) it would likely not be immoral. And unlike illegal dumping or selling counterfeit goods or narcotics, whether someone is technically illegal in a country says nothing about their morality or character.

I would say that insisting on using a term like illegal alien or illegal immigrant is kind of the opposite of virtue signalling. Vice signalling perhaps? It seems to be done specifically to associate undocumented immigrants with illegality and by extension - immorality and bad character; someone not to be trusted.</text>
