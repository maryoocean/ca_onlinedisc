    <title>cmv: K-12 Educators push a false narrative that all college degrees are good investments</title>
    <original_poster>Suitable-Ad-8598</original_poster>
    <original_post>Students in high school are bombarded with pressure to go to college by educators, with high emphasis on the ranking of the schools they are accepted into and no emphasis on the majors that they choose.

Nobody is warning students that picking liberal arts majors (unless they go to an ivy league school or something like it), will probably make them financially worse off then not even getting a degree in the first place. I know a girl that did gender studies at Columbia and is working as a barista several years out of college and is in about $400,000 in debt. I went to a way worse school than Columbia and nearly all of my friends with liberal arts degrees are stuck working as cashiers and in food service. I know a ton of people who went to community colleges (which was highly frowned upon in my high school culture) who are making six figures a couple years out of school (STEM and sales).

Why are we not being honest with these kids about the consequences of incurring student debt in unusable majors? I am not saying people shouldn't have the right to make their own major choices, but this is like handing children a pack of cigarettes and not telling them it causes cancer.

Edit: I probably exaggerated when I said worse than no degree if we are talking about long-term in their livesâ€”I kind of meant in place of certifications or bootcamps.  What I should have said is that the lack of jobs in liberal arts fields seems to not be communicated to kids, which has significant negative financial consequences.

    <text>I think it needs more specificity. There are more to liberal arts than gender studies and history majors.   
I have a liberal arts degree and make six figures. I didn't go to an ivy league school. I'm also not working in an industry that I went to school for, but my degree gave me me the versatility to jump into lots of different situations.   
The arts, especially entertainment and media, are rapidly growing industries.

Among other things, liberal arts degrees are really good at teaching soft skills, which are really in demand with employers right now. Research, critical thinking and adaptability, leadership, problem-solving, teamwork, writing and communication are all soft skills taught at liberal arts degrees. These skills are in-demand with employees: 90% of hiring managers rated communication as an important skill, 84% rated critical thinking, 85% of hiring managers rated the ability to work independent.  

I don't think the issue is liberal arts, I think the issue is students aren't given clear career paths in college. Plus, college is just too expensive and people aren't being paid enough to keep up with inflation and minimum wage.</text>
