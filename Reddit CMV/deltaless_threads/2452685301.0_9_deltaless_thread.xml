    <title>CMV: Alpha males are actually 95 percent beta</title>

    <original_post>The others are human traffickers internet celebrities.  
I really don't believe this bullshit. I made a lot of observations in the military and people don't fit these patterns. The reason I'm writing this is because they contradict what they made up. they're all going after a few "alphas". but speaking by their rules, one alpha never follows another alpha. For example, andrew tat. This guy has millions of followers. most of them are men. others are probably female simps. now, if they are all alpha then what are all these alphas doing together? Why are alphas praising or defending andrew tate on the internet? All I see is adolescents who have not become individuals, have chosen a "male" role model for themselves from the internet. or, in their language, the alpha male gathered all betas around him.  
 just it. speaking by the book, an alpha never follows another alpha, when an alpha sees another alpha, he prepares for a fight. there is only one alpha in a group, there is no such thing as an assistant alpha. There are only loyal betas who take advantage of alpha. But, as far as I can see, these aren't even beta. fanboys only.  
Another contradiction (paradox?) "sigmas". I'll cut it short. why would a sigma have discussions with anonymous people on the internet about being sigma?   
Imagine that: Kai, the most famous sigma (who is a beyblade character, not kpop) is watching videos of the his sigma brothers to be cool (or make a girl). do you think this makes sense?</original_post>

    <text>There is no scientific basis that any of this alpha beta dynamics exists in human relationships. The guy who made this observations in wolves had to retract his paper, and spent the rest of his career explaining that the result of his research was complete BS. Adult wolves not in captivity absolutely do not have alpha or beta roles. Some times one leads, some times one follows, depends on situations and whatever is best for the survival of the pack.

By the time researchers realize they were wrong, they were too late because the $11bn self-help industry had already latched onto this idea. They convinced enough people that the reason they were unsatisfied with their career or sex lives was because they weren’t “alpha” enough, then proceeded to sell them courses and books filled with out-of-context/outdated social psychology studies.

In reality, there is no causal relationship proving that the “alpha” qualities led to success success, despite it does appear that way to millionaires and celebrities. You’re rich, successful or famous not because you are confident and have high self-esteem and what not. You are confident and charismatic because you are rich and famous. There are also plenty of people with alpha qualities who failed to be rich and famous, you just don’t hear about them because, well, they aren’t rich and famous.</text>
