    <title>CMV: It's fair to compare carnists (people who eat meat) to nazis.</title>
    <original_poster>Arkenhiem651</original_poster>
    <original_post>1) Carnists think that animals are inferior; Nazis think that jews are inferior
2) Carnists put animals in camps; Nazis put jews in camps
3) Both jews and animals attempt to escape
4) Both are/were normalized. Anyone who goes against these beliefs were/are suppressed and treated as illogical/emotionally driven
5) Both are unnecessary 
6) Both are/were driven long distances and murdered
7) emotional detachment from the victims
8) Both are sentient
Alex Hershaft a holocaust survivor also used this comparison along with other vegan holocaust survivors.
"We're focusing on the victims rather than the cancer of oppression itself",[8] and that "I noted with horror the striking similarities between what the Nazis did to my family and my people, and what we do to animals we raise for food: the branding or tattooing of serial numbers to identify victims, the use of cattle cars to transport victims to their death, the crowded housing of victims in wood crates, the arbitrary designation of who lives and who dies — the Christian lives, the Jew dies; the dog lives, the pig dies."[6

Also Alex Hershshaft looks extremely young considering he's 88 and survived concentration camps. That's irrelevant but I thought it interesting enough to mention considering he claims it's due to his vegan diet.

Edit: I know I say Jews but this also applies to other victims of the concentration camps such as Slavic peoples, gays and communists</original_post>

    <text>7:"emotional detachment from the victims", any farmer that eat his own product can , and personaly i will tell you, yes we love our animals and we give them the best of life we can,but at the end of the day we have to eat them and we give them humane ways to die, 0 pain quick death, ect....

jews they were killed in ways that i dont even feel confortable saying them, they were not painless.

5ª"Both are unnecessary tough this is kinda true, its easier and cheaper to fullfill a complete diet using animal products eggs, milk (im aware of the milk problem) than using all plant derived products

6º "Both are/were driven long distances and murdered" lets be honest here , this aint even a good argument, in my parents farm animals lived they breeded and they died.

2º"Carnists put animals in camps; Nazis put jews in camps" also a false statement, animales like sheep have to graze you cant just put them in a camp and forget about it, you have to gide them trough plains so they eat, again another false argument.

3º"Both jews and animals attempt to escape" and 8º"Both are sentient" animals are not sentient in the same way that us, they are sentient but not humane, they do not understand corelation in most cases, if they "try to escape" they dont do it for the fear of being killed, they do it for the food they see outside

&amp;amp;#x200B;

edit :"6º "Both are/were driven long distances and murdered" lets be honest here , this aint even a good argument, in my parents farm they lived they breeded and they died."

forgot to add the word "animal" context changed by a lot.</text>
