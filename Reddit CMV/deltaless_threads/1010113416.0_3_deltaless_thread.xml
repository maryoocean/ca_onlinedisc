    <title>CMV:Villains in pop culture from comic books box TV shows movies are all the good guys.</title>
    <original_poster>ComfortableBrick3</original_poster>
    <original_post>When it comes to pop-culture in movies I see the fact that people always view the villains to be bad guys and I just don’t understand why because everything they’re doing is right and the heroes are always mostly wrong. They talk about how they wanna rule The entire world and take over the universe and if you think about it are we humans in real life trying to do the same thing and stuff like destroying humanity is actually a good thing human race is pretty much a fucked up species we deserve and they don’t believe in love compassion and friendship and I’ll a lot of that is just bullshit meaningless concepts, power in the end is what’s important  and a whole bunch of other crimes it’s just made up stuff that we may have considered to be wrong.If There is a way to convince me if you guys can give me a better argument why I’m wrong.</original_post>
