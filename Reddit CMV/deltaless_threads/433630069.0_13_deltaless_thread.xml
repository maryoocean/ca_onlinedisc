    <title>CMV: I should be able to sell my organs</title>
    <original_poster>stupidrobots</original_poster>
    <original_post>In short I should receive adequate compensation during life for use of my organs after my death.  The goal of this is to provide a financial incentive to increase the supply (and thus reduce cost) of organs required for transplant.  The benefits I see are as follows:

1) it gives the poor and disadvantaged a way to make money and get on their feet without requiring higher education or years of experience, relieving debts.

2) The financial incentive gives people reason to donate organs who might otherwise not.  This increases supply and drives down cost, and reduces time on waiting lists.  

3) A profitable program of organ collection would allow advertising for agencies that do this service and write up contracts, increasing the visibility of the needs of people who require organ transplants.

4) The argument that this creates a black market for organs is silly.  If someone wanted to kill you and take your organs, laws against it won't really help because now we're talking about maniacs.  

Furthermore my organs are my property, and I get to say what happens to my property during my lifetime and at the time of my death.  To deny this is to deny that individuals have the right to their own bodies.

    <text>First off, if everyone could get payment now for organs later, the payments would be minuscule.  Organs might be worth a lot now only because they're so rare.  It's basic supply and demand.

Second, not everyone who's an organ donor ends up donating.  Your organs could be far too damaged, incompatible genetically, or impossible to use logistically (you can't put an adult lung in a small child; you can't take a heart from NYC to California so quickly and doing so would be cumbersome, and someone in NYC would need it).

&amp;gt;Furthermore my organs are my property

They're not.  They're a part of your person but property is entirely different.  You're approaching this like an American layman.  The consequences of allowing one person to do this would be magnified to everyone, and the consequences would be sweeping.  The idea that you can control things after dying is equally absurd and we only really allow it when it comes to estates.</text>
