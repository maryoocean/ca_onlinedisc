    <original_post>The institutions they run the US are horrendous.  

We have the worlds largest prison population, which maintains legal slavery.

Capitalist overlords hoard the majority of wealth while the working poor is real and growing.

For not the first time in kinda recent history concentration camps are back. 

My entire life I’ve been told things are the way they are, and there’s nothing to be done about it.  But that’s fucking bullshit. 

I don’t believe for a second that reforms will ever give power, real power to the people of this world. The teachers, the workers, the families that will grind through this hellscape as best they can for their entire lives, just trying not to go hungry on the streets.  

The State has a monopoly on violence. If we break that monopoly up, if we use that power for ourselves, against the enemies of humanity, maybe the world gets better sooner rather than later.</original_post>

    <text>I see violence more as side effect of protests that end up making the country better. For instance, take the civil rights movement. There was certainly violence, but much of led to the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act were peaceful protests. Things get better very slowly. Laws and amendments ultimately confer power and status in this country, not violence.

From another perspective imagine if you did change the world for the better through violence. What is stopping someone more powerful than you from perpetrating violence against you to change your reform? I would doubt your movement will be the most violence and thus cannot hold the change you initially  created.</text>
