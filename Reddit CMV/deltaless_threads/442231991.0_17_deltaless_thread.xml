    <title>CMV: Christianity is held together through fear</title>
    <original_poster>M1STER_B0NES</original_poster>
    <original_post>My opinion is that if the fear of going to Hell was not present in the Christian ideology, then most of the followers of the religion would not be there.

Before I decided I was agnostic, that was my only reason for continuing to identify with the religion. Then, I decided I wasn't going to let fear control me. 

All in all, I don't see how this is any different than blackmailing a person to do what you want. You present your instruction, then tell them how you will completely devastate their life if they do not follow through.</original_post>

    <text> Don't underestimate the strength of just belonging to something. In my experience, having like - minded community is more important  to the masses than the community's beliefs themselves.  Consequently,  it often falls to dogma; my parents were so I am. This also explains people hypocrisy in the practice of most religions. "Thou shalt not judge"...whoops, missed that celestial memo...</text>
