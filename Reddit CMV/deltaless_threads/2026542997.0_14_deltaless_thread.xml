    <title>CMV: The poor are the enemy of the rich</title>
    <original_poster>The_Saracen_Slayer</original_poster>
    <original_post>My contention is simple:  the poor are fundamentally the enemy of the rich and for the prosperity of the later, this maxim must never be forgotten. And whatever “compromises” are established between the two races are simply temporal practical concessions for creating a preferred balanced environment…but this does not solve the ultimate underlying conflict between the two.

I won’t base this claim much on socio-economic research since I find such disciplines to lack the sufficient rigor I value from applied math and statistics modeling (at least for these macro level claims). Instead I will simply use personal anecdotes and maybe some generalized historical events to support my claim.

Being rich is of course an objectively superior attribute. Even as a child I immediately knew the luxuries of the new rich inheritance  were vastly preferable to the environment of being poor. Only an imbecile would think otherwise. But it wasn’t until I lost my innocence did I understand the dichotomy that being rich caused between family and friends. The poor envy, that is universal truth. The poor will always envy the rich, and this alone will always be a destabilizing force between the two classes (for humility is unfortunately a lacking virtue in the vast majority of humans).

Because of this, the poor will inevitably always end up hating the rich and this will lead to violence if left untamed. We’ve seen it in historical events: slave revolts, seizure of property and of course good old revolutionary distribution of wealth movements. Furthermore, ideologies like egalitarianism or communist type theories are indeed weapons that can, and have, be used to seize the assets of the rich. 

The ultimate goal of the rich is to maintain their prosperity, and this requires looking at the reality of the situation. No matter the current system, the rich must always be vigilant for any populist movements…because they will all inevitably be used to take money away from us and give it to the poor.</original_post>

    <text>The fact that you're lumping together a lot of vastly different situations, up to and including slave revolts, and treating them interchangably suggest you're not looking at what else is going on in those scenarios. 

There's no singular attitude on wealth. It depends vastly on how a person acquires their wealth and what they do with it. Most historical examples aren't examples of hatred toward regular people who happen to be rich. They're examples of hatred toward feudal lords and warlords, cronies of corrupt governments, even literal slavemasters since you've decided to lump that in as an example of anti-rich sentiment. In other words, historically we aren't taking about the merely wealthy. We're talking about people who used their wealth and power to put themselves above the law or make others a legally inferior class of people. It's a bit absurd to look at attitudes toward people who did that and conclude that they'd be hated no matter what they would do.</text>
