    <title>CMV: If a guy has trouble dating until his 30s, he should avoid romantic relationships altogether in his later life</title>
    <original_poster>uniklas</original_poster>
    <original_post>Sorry if this is post is guy centric, but if you feel this applies to women in some way, please include them too. 

I've seen it a few times, a guy for whatever reason is completely non existant to women in his 20s (mostly a combination of shyness and about average looks), he is the kind of guy that *wants* a relationship (like most of the people out there) and grows more desperate by the year. Then his 30s come and suddenly women start noticing him, he gets into a relationship, and then settles for the first woman he has ever been with in a long long time. The woman turns out to be trash of a human being, but the guy thinks he is so lucky to have found someone and she is the best he will ever get so he stays together for 10 or more years. Basically he settles for the first gal that has showed him some interest maybe ever.

I believe a guy like this would be happier if he would never date anyone ever, since he hasn't developed the skills necessary to screen people properly and will most likely fall prey to a woman that is a terrible human being.

Why do I think he will necessarily fall for this kind of a woman as there are plenty of nice 30 something or whatever somethings women out there? There are plenty of formerly young and pretty and shallow women who have got together with rich and shallow men in their 20s, men who have stayed rich and shallow, but women have stayed young and pretty, so they have parted their ways. These women, understandablly, go desperate pretty fast and figure they won't find anyone rich to care for them anymore, so they reduce and reduce their expecations until we get to the level of maybe well of single guys, and who is easier than the guy who won't even try to court anyone anymore? Give him some attention and he is yours to keep.

All is well and good, if she is a decent enough person, but chances are that someone who has been pampered with expensive material things from a young age up until then will not find joy in anything less than she had before and often times the guy will not be able/struggle to hold her to her standarts of living.

So to repeat myself a bit. It is great if a guy like this finds a girl he matches with later in life, but the odds are he won't, as he just doesn't have the skills necessary to do so. He is overwhelmingly more likely to be snatched by someone who has nothing to them except past beauty and he being as unexperienced as he is will think this is all there is to it and will settle for it.

I believe a guy like this would be way happier and even happy overall if he just got to terms that he ought to stay single forever and just work on his platonic relationships or whatever that truly gives him joy and meaning in life.</original_post>

    <text>Your view seems to depend on men becoming so desperate that they will be willing to marry someone they don't actually get along with.  If so, it seems as though the real issue is this desperation, not the lack of dating experience per se, right?

As a person who started dating somewhat later in life myself, the key isn't to withdraw from the possibility of romantic relationships, but rather to accept the possibility that you won't have any romantic relationships.

That sounds like the same thing, but it's not.  Romantic relationships are RELATIONSHIPS: they're interpersonal, between person A and person B.  You're describing things entirely impersonally, and I think a lot of dudes see it that way, but it's off the mark.  I don't marry Brenda because I don't want to be alone; I marry Brenda because I want to be with *Brenda* more than I want to be without Brenda.  

The way to accomplish this mindset is twofold: to stop seeing romance as being about achievement, and to increase social skills in other areas.  Lots of men don't value or understand friendship; they don't perceive emotional intimacy as existing outside a romantic context.  Also, lots of men get desperate because what they really care about is the fact that "landing a woman" means they're not a loser, which is a terrible mindset that wrecks your life in a million ways.  

Fix those things, and you're fine.</text>

What I'm arguing is the exact opposite. If one has no luck in 30 or so years it is rational to think that the chances are slim for him. It is rational to accept that there is a possibility of a romantic relationship, as there is a possibility of winning a lottery, just don't get your hopes up. (In reality of course there is a decent enough chance, I'm talking about perception here. Flip a coin a 100 times if it's all tails you can start believing it is always tails, I won't be mad at you).

I'm arguing that there is extra variability in this equation, it isn't just you either find someone or you don't, it's not binary. It's how good of someone you find and you are very likely to find someone bad, overvalue him/her, and since it is so rare to you, you won't be willing to end everything for a chance to "roll the dice" again.</text>

    <text>Actually I just found some

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_age\_at\_first\_marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_age_at_first_marriage)

&amp;amp;#x200B;

The median age of first marriage for American men is 29.2. From this, we can guess that 40ish percent of American men who marry do so at 30 or later.</text>
