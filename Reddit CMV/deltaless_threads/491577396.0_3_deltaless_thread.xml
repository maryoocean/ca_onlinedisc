    <title>CMV: The Godfather III is better than II.</title>
    <original_poster>meadowsopr</original_poster>
    <original_post>For me, The Godfather Part II only shines when Robert DeNiro is on screen. Whenever the film cuts back to Michael I hate it, because I think it's a melodramatic pause from the good story. Part III is a consistent movie IMO, with the only inconsistency being a bad performance from Sofia Coppola. I think the drama is intriguing and Andy Garcia does a great job. 

TL;DR Although the Vito storyline in II is probably my favorite plot in the trilogy, the other plot is boring, whereas III is more consistent.

p.s. Godfather I trumps both II and III by a mile IMO.

    <text>After watching the trilogy again for the 'x'th time last month, I'll have to disagree.  As subjective as this discussion is, I'll argue that there is a drastic difference between part III, when compared with I &amp;amp; II.  The filmography is wrong and looks like a Mexican soap-opera, the dialog is poorly delivered by "EVERYONE" (in Pacino voice), and consists almost entirely of exposition.  The dollar amounts are silly, even for 1990. The Vatican money laundering and Pope assassination plots are un-emotive and convoluted. The third act killing montage, a hallmark of the Godfather movies, are unsurprising and telegraphed throughout the whole film. Stabbed to death with glasses? What the hell was that?   Anyway, I think Sophia Coppola is shouldering way too much of the burden for a fantastically terrible movie.     Edit -  In my rant against part III I failed to defend why it's better than part II. My point was that the acting, dialog, plot and promotion of the themes that extend through the family history are all delivered much more artistically and thoughtfully in Part II compared with III, IMO. </text>
