    <title>CMV: all (US) roads that are not highways between cities or states should only have a single, one-way, lane of civilian traffic or less.</title>
    <original_poster>Square-Dragonfruit76</original_poster>
    <original_post>The main reasoning for my argument is because there at this point has been consistent, replicated, research finding that the more roads you add, the more traffic is actually _increased._ It would be a rough transition at first, but in theory, traffic would be diminished if you cut down the number of roads and the number of lanes. This would be great for the environment but it also would be great for everyone driving because there would be less traffic. The lanes that are no longer in use could be used to improve our society in a number of ways. They could be made into trees or park area. They could be restricted to only delivery vehicles and/or public transit or emergency vehicles. Or they could be made into bike paths. And if all goes well, perhaps people would even be open to eliminating some roads for civilian traffic all together.

Edit: Again, to reiterate, according to all the current research, more roads actually _create_ more traffic. So if anything, this would reduce traffic, maybe not immediately, but over time. A lot of people seem to not have read that part, so I'm not going to respond to repeats of people who clearly did not read my argument.

    <text>There are plenty of places that aren't highways where one-way roads are a terrible idea.

This village ([https://i.imgur.com/hPMBjPm.png](https://i.imgur.com/hPMBjPm.png)) has extremely quiet roads and making them one-way would do nothing except make it super tedious to navigate. A lot of roads there are barely wider than a one-way road anyway and you wouldn't clear up much space at all.

Or what about small country roads like this ([https://i.imgur.com/yja72l6.png](https://i.imgur.com/yja72l6.png))? They are sparse and very quiet and to make a functioning road network from one-way roads you would actually have to build more roads, not fewer.

One-way roads are very useful to direct traffic in certain places and you're right that the US should build much smaller roads and invest more in public transit, but one-way roads everywhere isn't the way to go. There should be fewer lanes on throughfares and neighbourhood roads should be much narrower (but remain two-way).</text>
