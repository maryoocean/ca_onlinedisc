    <title>CMV: The current state of sexual harassment allegations can have a devastating affect on social relationships and employee/employer trust.</title>
    <original_poster>totally_bamboozled</original_poster>
    <original_post>In the past 2-3 months, we've seen dozens of high profile men step down from positions of authority due to sexual harassment allegations. In many cases, it looks like these allegations are backed by credible evidence, but on the other hand, it seems like this culture of "Fire First, Investigate Later" could gradually turn into a kind of corporate witch hunt. 

I truly believe that rape culture is a real and scary phenomenon on college campuses and corporate workplaces alike, but it seems like this has the potential to spiral out of control. In a nutshell, we're promoting a culture where any male's life could come crashing to the ground with a single email. With a few paragraphs of false, though believable information about a suspected incident of workplace groping, my personal career could come to an end. With it, my source of income and social/professional relationships take a permanent hit. When I've asked my wife about this, she has said, "Sorry, it's men's faults for creating this culture of insecurity and harassment for so many women in the first place."

I don't know how to explain it, but this seems like a scary path to go down. I'm a millennial that didn't grow up in the 1950's to help create decades of complicity in workplace harassment. Sexual harassment against women is a real problem, but it seems like there's no buffer between legitimate claims and claims that have the potential for abuse. Worse, sexual harassment allegations have included claims of "unwanted attention" and "unsolicited gifts" as credible allegations that could contribute to someone's firing. See [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/11/28/567026934/npr-chief-news-editor-departs-in-wake-of-harassment-allegationshere). Knowing that the line for sexual harassment in the workplace has been blurred to fairly commonplace social interactions means that *any* male employee/employer is at risk of losing their job.

    <text>How sexual harassment allegations impact public figures is very different from how they impact private figures. With politicians and celebrities, trial by public matters a lot more because having public trust is part of their job. They also aren't part of conventional workplaces where a fair process can be expected. Most private companies do have avenues for dealing with sexual harassment in the workplace. Most employers aren't willing to fire someone over a single email. Even in these public cases I haven't seen an example of something that sparse ending a person's career. I think you're being a bit  paranoid here.</text>

I didn't respond to this earlier, but it's a good post. Your point is very apt and it's something I didn't consider initially. It raises of fair analysis of how we judge public versus private figures and why our standards of sexual harassment will be tougher on public figures. It didn't wholly CMV, but it is certainly an interesting addition.  </text>
