    <title>cmv: There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as an “American”</title>
    <original_poster>thomash363</original_poster>
    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>In Mexico regional affiliation is still present tied to even prehispanic times. The popular convention in the country is to call yourself where you're from primarily and people often in conversation, that context, refer to Mexico as the federal district region. People call themselves foreigners when travelling to different states even within Mexico, bc quite honestly they used to be vastly different before colonization and as well before the historical nationalization efforts of the 19th and 20th century.</text>

    <text>I usually say just say I’m from the US. In Spanish, I’ll say soy de los Estados Unidos or soy una gringa (depending on context). Saying American doesn’t bother me, although I guess in some ways I can see where it could be potentially confusing and/or elitist. The ones I think could have claim to being slighted are the rest of the people who live on the American Continents. 

“American” isn’t just the USA, but colloquially it has become that way for those of us from the US. I don’t think it’s supposed to say that anyone else residing in North or South America outside the US is any less “American” in a geographical sense. 

I guess, my closest comparison would be if you could had a hegemonic colonial empire on the African continent that called itself the United States of Africa, and it’s people would call themselves African. Which would then confuse the rest of people who refer to themselves as African. But, for historical reasons, doesn’t seem like that is going to happen. And, because of colonialism, ethnic nationalism can tend to supersede civic nationalism (because the country lines were arbitrarily created by the colonists, and often put rivaling groups together and expected them to all of sudden call themselves Nigerian or Rwandan instead of their identity of Igbo, Yoruba, etc) in Africa. It’s like someone from Texas saying they are Texan first and “American” second. Except not arbitrary and silly, but really divided ethnic groups that were forced to become part of a country who’s lines split their populations and grouped them with others who had completely different religious, ethnic, and cultural identities (and then the colonizers played their differences off each other which would later lead to catastrophic genocide and decades of political turmoil.)

And, many different countries in the Americas celebrate their ethnic-nationalism that is usually and amalgamation of centuries of blending cultures with indigenous, Africans brought from the Slave trade, the colonizers, as well as mass immigration during the 20th century (like Argentina), creating something uniquely Colombian, Bolivian, Venezuelan, etc. Although race, class, and ethnic identities are complex and lead to inequities and societal struggles as well. 

Generally, most people choose to identify with their nation-state as opposed to their continent. Although they do have terms that encompass their ethnic origins: Latin, Hispanic, SudAmericano/a (but I haven’t heard that much).

I try not to be outraged for people who are not outraged. I, do try to be conscious of my identity and could potentially see how telling everyone I’m “AMERICAN” could come off as crass and/or ignorant. I truly don’t believe that is the intent, it’s just how we colloquially refer to ourselves. So now I’m  more country specific and say I’m from the US instead of American. Unless, I don’t want people to know I’m from the US, and then all of a sudden I’m Canadian. (In fact, I’ve never actually used the old Canadian switcheroo but I’ll switch to Spanish if I’m somewhere I don’t want to stand out as an American).

Lastly, Child Gambino’s song, “This is America” (which I love) was recently countered by a Puerto Rican artist named Residente. I’ll link the song, it’s called “this is not America” The Wikipedia on the song seems compromised, but there is a paragraph where the artist expresses his thought behind the term. There are a lot of English language articles about the song.

From Wikipedia:

The term "America" is also discussed in the song, with Residente rapping that "America is not just the USA. It's from Tierra del Fuego to Canada. You've got to be really gross, really hollow. It's like saying that Africa is just Morocco".[8] During his interview with Genius, Residente mentions that when he went to the United States, as a Latino, he was uncomfortable with the fact that they used the term to refer only to the country. Affirming that this did not bother him or offend him, but only made him uncomfortable, he said that he felt like "Man, these people think they are the center of the world".[8]

Residente, himself, is a bit polarizing, although I appreciate his lyrics and how he sings about the struggles of Latin American people. For some, he’s a bit much. But the song is very interesting and the video as well. You can find references for all the historical events he cites in the song, as well as the video. I don’t think he is hating on Gambino’s “America,” just rather highlighting the struggles of other “Americans” too.

Sorry for the very long ramble. I am a political scientist, but I’m not citing source material, and this just a general observational overview. Also, the only person I can speak for is myself. Others may have different views.

    <text>I’m curious too.  There isn’t any other sensible demonym in English to use to refer to residents of the United States. More importantly, several other countries also have the words “United States” in their official name, so that would be even more inappropriate.</text>

    <text>Quick note that as a Canadian, I don’t disagree with calling Americans… er, Americans. In fact as a generality we hate being referred to as Americans ourselves despite it technically being the truth, as we see it as a slight against our distinction from the US.

However, the only country currently in existence today that have “United States” in it as written (in English at least) is the good ol’ USA. The closest country to having “United States” in their name is Mexico, whose official name is “United Mexican States” although there have been a fair few countries that used to have “United States” in them, such as “United States of Brazil” being the official name for Brazil from 1937 to 1967

No real purpose in pointing that out besides for the sake of accuracy, since as previously stated I agree that “American” is the only sensible demonym (or English exonym for that matter)

    <text>Given that your username appears to be a crude Spanish phrase, I’m going to assume that you are of Spanish descent.

Operating off of that assumption, your reply makes plenty of sense and I take no issue with you considering yourself to be an American, and I agree with you that I also would be an American.

However, the vast majority of non-Spanish-descended Canadians I’ve spoken to about it is at least a little irked when referred to as an American, particularly if it’s meant to imply that Canada and the US are indistinguishable.

Personally, that’s the only time I take issue with being called an American.</text>

    <text>I think we all are to blame. I’m European, if someone from a South American country would introduce himself as an American, which would technically be correct, I’d automatically assume he is from the U.S. I don’t think there’s a wrong intention from the citizens of the U.S. calling themselves American, it’s something that has grown trough the years.
But if you look at it from a different angle. 
How would the world feel if all of a sudden (for example) Germany decided to call themselves Europe from now on? And not in a unifying way, where other countries can also just call themselves Europe. But in a way of ‘We are the uber Europeans, so from now WE call ourselves Europe.’ What if China decided to call themselves ‘Asia’ instead. Wouldn’t there at least be a doubt about why they are starting to ‘claim’ the whole continent?
Again, the ‘Americans’ thing is something that grew organically and is now ingrained in language all over most of the world. But it would be better if there would be another, more specific name for citizens of the U.S. However, even if a fitting name would be decided, changing that into everyday language could take a very long time.</text>

    <text>I think it’s because in South America, those citizens would refer to themselves as the country they’re in, ie Brazilian. Not the continent of South America. But since the United States of America encompasses multiple states over North ‘America’. It’s easier to refer to us all as Americans, even though the name is the same as two continents, but it’s referencing the country’s name again.</text>

    <text>An actual factor in considering whether a landmass is a continent is whether the native population considers it to be a continent.

I agree it could be taken that way, in the same vein that North America and South America can be seen as one continent of America.

These denotations between North/South America and Europe/Asia are likely rooted in racism and xenophobia</text>
    </comment>
  <comment id="43515923076.0" user="Secret-Employ-40" delta="False">
    <text>This "actual factor" is a completely subjective consideration of what a landmass should be called and the actual native population did not consider South America and North America as a single landmass. What's called Turtle Island is North America.

The funny thing is that the combined America's continent model is an outdated colonial era model developed by Spanish and Portugese imperialists rooted in racism and Xenophobia.

While on the other hand the 7 continent model is based on more objective measures like plate tectonics, weather patterns and land connections.</text>

That’s interesting.

Yeah it's in the name of a couple continents, too. But as far as nationality goes, people from the US are Americans.

People from Canada are also North Americans (see this is the proper continent name now). Nobody identifies as being Americans outside the USA. America is not a continent.</text>

B) “American” absolutely can mean somebody who lives in the Americas. To argue that they can’t would be to say that somebody who is from Southeast Asia can’t be referred to as an Asian. It’s just a less specific descriptor, the same as somebody from Earth can be called an Earthling even though they’re from one of the Americas. They aren’t mutually exclusive terms</text>

    <text>My state's constitution is written in German. It was the only language that ever came close to being adopted as the official language of the US. Our largest immigrant population in the US hails from German-speaking countries. At the time of the 1910 census, prior to the wars, some 10% of the US population were 1st or 2nd generation German.    


The Germans on my grandparents' side, to avoid anti-german sentiments during ww1 and WW2 pretended to be English, anglicized their names, and only referenced the English-speaking members in their family. Today, as a result of that purge, typically only Amish, mennonite, and other such groups speak the language.

I learned this bit of trivia on a childhood trip to the Grand Canyon. Germans kept mistaking me for a jew, and kept trying to speak to me in German. My grandmother taught me how to say "Nein, ich spreche kein Deutsch", which i found was too formal, and invited further questions (in German). No I just say Nein spreche Deutsch" and the realize I REALLY can't speak it.

I didn't "learn" anything today. America, in English, is not a continent in normal, formal or informal usage. This is incorrect usage and anyone saying this, is using incorrect English. Period. Native English speakers use "America" to mean the country, pretty much full-stop, outside of rare acronyms or certain organization names.

If you use "American" and you're not naming an international organization, you are using the word wrong in English.

**No, I very much did NOT say this. Do not put words in my mouth**

I said that the term "America" is sometimes **rarely** used as a synonym for "the Americas".

"The Americas" is NOT a term for a continent.

**Even your link said this**. The continents in English are **North America** and **South America**. "The Americas" is **not** a continent. America, when used in this rare context, is **not** being discussed as a continent, but just a geographical region. You could also use the term, "western hemisphere", which is a tiny bit broader. That **also** is not referring to a continent.

"The Americas" includes **two** continents.</text>

And now you come back and say “the Americas” is not a single continent. Again there is no consensus on this. There are seven-continent and six-continent models of all kinds. One of the latter I latter refers to N and S America as “America” being one continent. You don’t get to say what is and what isn’t a continent.

This is not how any English speaker uses the term America, whatsoever, at all. You are insisting on your poor use of the English language now, and are obstinate in the face of being corrected by a native English speaker - multiple native English speakers - trying to go out of their way and correct your incorrect English.

We do not use "America" for the continent. We use "North America" and "South America". If you want to refer to both, you use the term, "the Americas". That is standard native English, and not just in the United States, but in the UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand too.

You don't get to barge into a language group and say, "you're doing it wrong!!!!".

You can obviously use whatever words you want, but native English speakers are going to perceive your way of speaking as odd and foreign, and evidence of lack of experience with the language.</text>

    <text>It doesn't, though. That is a wikipedia for "The Americas", you know, the term I said was correct above if you want to refer to both continents in English.

The link agrees with me, in fact, pointing out that "America" commonly means "the USA". We use "the Americas" for talking about both, with only very rare usage of "America" in this context (usually in shorter acronym phrases, like "Pan-American"

&gt; In modern English, North and South America are generally considered separate continents, and taken together are called the Americas, or more rarely America

So again, yeah, if you use "America" to mean "the Americas", outside of some specialized contexts, you're using bad English, that nobody, literally nobody uses. You want to be misunderstood and come off as a less skilled English speaker, be my guest. But in English, "America" means "USA". "The Americas" means "both North and South America".

You literally wrote that America is not a continent and that “no English speaker would” use that term. And now you cite the page where it word for word says that America is used in the English language to refer to the double continent. Either your reading comprehension sucks or you are being ridiculously dense. Again, It literally states that (although rarely) America is used to refer to the combination of both North and South America. 
So at least you could concede that “America is not a continent” is plain wrong. You were mistaken. And the link DISAGREES with you. 

The discussion was never about “the US is commonly referred to as America” I never challenged that. It was about your misinformed idea that America is not a continent. Again it might not often be referred to as such in the US but it remains a continent. This is not even a point of debate anymore?

    <text>The problem here is that you consider the Americas to be one continent while he (and most of the English world) does not, so to him your argument didn't make sense. To him America is only the USA and the landmass is split between North and South America. I'm Canadian, and I use the same convention. I'm North American, not American. A person from Chile is South American, not American.

To be frank, the definition of a continent is culturally specific and not some rigorous scientific definition, so as much as you feel like it might be wrong to split them out really isn't. Personally I have found that any definition that combines North and South America into one should also then combine Europe, Asia, and Africa into Afroeurasia based on the same logic, but that's just my opinion.</text>

  <comment id="43513473851.0" user="viniciusbfonseca" delta="False">
    <text>I agree with what you said on the first paragraph, and indeed we do have the definitons of what a continent is but not one on how they really should be divided. 

I personally don't think that it wouldn't make sense to combine North and South America but separate Afroeurasia. We use tecnonic plates as a general guide, but the other important factor is convention and (to a lesser extent) similarities.

Any definition that does separate South and North America should be separating The Middle East and South Asia from Asia and have each be its own continent.</text>

    <text>" don't think that it wouldn't make sense"
The double negatives are throwing me off here. It seems like you are saying that you think the Americas should be combined and Africa seperated. Is that right? 

Could you give me a definition that splits Africa away without also splitting the Americas?

What I tried to get across was that most definitions that combine North and South America would also have to combine Africa and  Eurasia in order to be consistent, not that I want Afroeurasia to be combined and the Americas separated. 

The definition of "large and distinct landmasses" would split North and South America while keeping Africa separated from Eurasia. Africa connects to Eurasia by an even larger land connection than we have at Panama, so you cannot say that the isthmus connecting them is why they should be together.

Splitting Europe from Asia requires moving away from the landmass definition alone and instead taking into account other geographical features and historical cultural lines. Traditional boundaries between Europe and Asia are varied, but they commonly use the Ural Mountains and varying rivers that make up the Caucus watershed to draw the lines. Like you suggested this makes it hard to keep Asia together without giving each of these subcontinents their own continental title. But then again, this is where historical cultural divides come into play. If the Western world says that Europe is a distinct place, dating back to ancient Greco-Roman history, then it is a distinct place within that cultural map of the world.</text>

    <text>It communicates the exact same information because "American" was appropriated by the US and forced down on others. If the use of "US American" were to begin then "American" can be used in the same sense as "African", "Asian", or "European". 

"ColOmbia" is the denonym for "ColOmbia", the suggested denonym is "ColUmbian" - which was once used to in colonial times to describe the people of the US. We do have denonyms that sound similar as another one, with "Nigerian"/"Nigerien" being the best example, so it won't be the first time.

"Yankee" I do see that can be a heated term within the US, even if it predates the US Civil War and if the Confederates did lose the war and remained "Yankees" (people from outside of the US do sometimes use Yankee as a denonym for the US, regardless if it's from the north or not).  

And there are others like Fredonians and Usonians that aren't confusing and don't sound weird like "United Statian"</text>

    <text>Appropriated is a bold word since no other country has the word America in its name. And I’m not a linguist nor a historian so correct me if I’m wrong but my gut feeling tells me “American” as the demonym for the US developed organically and gradually. America didn’t become a big enough player in global politics to force anybody anything until the late 1800s. By then, the term American must’ve been in wide use.

Colombian/Columbian makes the most sense to me as an alternative but only in writing. In oral communication, it would still be confusing as they’re homophones.</text>

If someone is American idk if they are from the USA, or Peru, or Mexico, etc.

They're all from countries in America (or America*s* for people for whom North and South America are Continents on their own).

Let's say some country in Europe changes it's name to United States of Europe. And they call themselves Europeans, because it's the only country with Europe in their name. Well they aren't wrong. But if someone says that they are European, from which country are they? United States of Europe? Denmark? Spain? They are all Europeans!</text>

It's a true arrogance to demand we change our own words in our own language for you and other people who are upset by this, when nothing of any substance will be better if we do. English has used these words for hundreds of years. Many Latin Americans don't care, and they're right not to, because it doesn't matter at all.

    <text>Do you really understand though? 

Do you understand that the US, for the past many decades, has contantly meddled in Latin American politics, overthrowing governments all over to install military dictatorships that'll sell bananas for cheap? 

That when Latin Americans hear "Americans" and "America" what we're hearing is a claim and a threat? That you're saying you're the only thing that matters and "everything the name touches belongs to you"? 

If the US was just some random country I doubt that there would be much problem with it, but it isn't. Greece and North Macedonia spent years fighting over North Macedonia's name for the very reason that Greece didn't want North Macedonia to be able to claim the region that was once Alexander the Great's Macedonia. They had to sign a treaty mediated by the UN and everything, that's how big such "name claims" can be.

And seriously, you guys want to change how "Latinos" are called (even Biden uses "LatinX"), speak ill of Spanish and Portuguese because they're gendered-languages, even define Brazilians as "Latinos" and "Latino" as a race (per your own census), but Latin Americans wanting that "American" be a general denonym for the Americas is what is arrogant?</text>

    <text>You are projecting so much stuff on the word "American," which predates every unrelated grievance you're attaching to it here. If you feel "threatened" by that, that's in your head. We aren't using this word as a threat, that's YOUR feelings and interpretation and, frankly, insecurity. Changing the word changes none of what you are saying is the issue here. You perceiving threat is your problem. You attaching it to us calling ourselves "American" is your interpretation.

And no, I don't use Latinx and levy similar criticisms onto it, as a form of cultural imperialism exactly like you're saying. It's not Americans' place to change languages that have gender built into them - I agree! In fact, they're the same issue: people projecting perceived issues onto words that don't actually carry them in any inherent way at all, and attempting to cross their culture to demand another culture conform to their demands based on their own baggage. It's in your head. It's arrogant and self-victimizing. Focus your energy somewhere important, it will make you happier than fighting a completely pointless, completely unwinnable internet battle over a word.</text>

    <text>It wasn't "appropriated" by the US. We're the only country in the world with the word America in it.

People don't refer to themselves by the continent they're on, they do it by country.

If you ask a German their nationality they will say German. They might say European to describe traits that distinguish all European countries from say, North American countries.

And for that matter, when people do distinguish between country and continent they tend to add the directional clarification. South East Asian, Eastern European, South American, Central American etc.

I understand that in some countries it's common to teach that there are 6 continents and they combine North and South America into "the Americas," so maybe that's where the confusion comes from.

The solution to that is to teach it as North and South America, not to say that the only Country named America should stop using it as their demonym.</text>

And I have never in my life heard Americans refer to Columbia outside of a historic personification like Lady Liberty, and that’s really amongst older generations. I don’t think Gen Z or Gen Alpha even know about the Columbian lore. As an American Millennial, the only reason I’ve heard of Columbia as the lore of which you speak is because I’ve dabbled in coin collecting and the Liberty coins often were compared to Columbia. 

May as well call us Washingtonians. And then that’d mix us up with the state as Columbian would mix us up with Colombians. But yeah, American is hurting no one.</text>

I think American is the most appropriate because there is no other country with the name America in it.  it is a unique identifier that does not borrow form anyone else, nor does anyone else lay claim to the name.

 It also seems highly inappropriate for someone else to claim one or more continents, which would be the only was a country other than the USA would have the slightest interest in the name.</text>

Any one of us living in North America the continent could accurately call themselves “North American”. And if we want to be pedantic about it, we could say that “American” includes us all.

Or should we maybe accept that people around the world generally call United States citizens “Americans” and not take the piss out of people you meet from another country?

Personally, I would say they’re being dickish and should move on to something that matters?</text>

The equivalent would be like if Americans were the ones trying to smugly correct Germans when they call themselves Deutchlanders, saying things like, "You are not Dutch, Netherlands is where Dutch people come from, you are German!

    <text>&gt;No, but America was the name of the continent before it was the name of the country.

Two continents-- in English there's no continent called "America," it's "South America" and "North America," with the division being at about the Panama/Colombia border.

&gt;The Cherokee was excluded from the definition of American without the prefix of Native, whilst having a longer claim to settlement on the land than the USA.

I'm not sure how you mean this, but right now a Cherokee who is a citizen of the US would be referred to as "American" when describing their nationality.

"Native American" is used to refer to race, not nationality.

&gt;I really don't think the colonial rule has anything to do with it.

I mean, it does. Yes, imperial powers did bad things in places like the US, Peru, New Zealand, Hokkaido, so on. But ultimately, their actions were relevant to the world. Once they came, the idea of a Cherokee, Inca, Maori, or Ainu nation was irrelevant very quickly.</text>

    <text>OK, but both have an equal claim to the name. It's not 'the United States of North America', is it? 

And when referring to native Americans, I was commenting on the European and settler perspective before the remnants of the original American nations were absorbed into the USA. They calling settlers 'americans', named after the ancestral home of many pre-existing nations. 'Native American' is a linguistic elbow from settlers; it would arguably more fair to refer to original american people as 'American' and others as 'immigrant american'. 

I think when creating the nation, the founding fathers could have been more mindful that they were building a new nation named after the land of dozens of other countries. Even if there were no non-colonial nations in the Americas, there were recently colonised people who were the rightful heirs to a state - not a fact necessarily appreciated at the time, but the first South American states to cast off their colonial chains happened in the lifetimes of one's who experienced the US revolution. I see this as Europeans destroying/subduing the American nations and then naming a 'United States of America' in the sudden void of nations. 

Also, New Zealand's official co-name is Aoteroa (long bright land / land of the long white cloud). The North Island is named Te Ika A Māui (the fish of Māui, a spiritual ancestor) and the South Island is Te Waka A Māui (the canoe of Māui). New zealand has to some degree recognised the importance of affording previous indigenous peoples cultural space in the names of the nation at all levels.

The term "America" isn't used to refer to the entire Alaska-Tierra del Fuego landmass in English. This is like saying that Scotland and Ireland have equal claim to "land." It just doesn't make sense to an English speaker.

&gt;it would arguably more fair...  
&gt;  
&gt;I think when creating the nation...  
&gt;  
&gt; there were recently colonised people who were the rightful heirs to a state..

I hear what you're saying, but 21st century fairness just wasn't a concern for people naming countries in the 18th and 19th centuries. The US isn't unique at all in this regard.

"Australia" is derived from the Latin word for "southern," but there are other countries in the southern hemisphere.

"Mexico" was the name of one small area, but there are other lands in the modern country Mexico.

China is called "Zhongguo" in Mandarin, which means "Middle Country," but many countries are in the middle of something.

South Africa isn't the only country in the southern bit of Africa.

Germany is called "Deutschland" which meant something like "land of the people," but every country has people.

&gt;Also, New Zealand's official co-name is Aoteroa ... affording previous indigenous peoples cultural space in the names of the nation at all levels.

That's interesting, I didn't know that. There has been a similar movement in the US to restore many Native American place names. For example, former Mt. McKinley (the highest mountain in the US) is called "Denali" now, a Native American name.

&gt;Also I'm not american and am not especially knowledgeable about America. I apologise if I've grossly misunderstood something important

This debate originated because English and Spanish/Portuguese define the continents differently. [In English there are seven continents, including North America and South America. In Spanish &amp; Portuguese there are six, with North America and South America being one continent called "America."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent#Number) 

So to a fluent English speaker, there isn't confusion. "America" has been used to refer to one country for 200+ years. It's just the name of a country. But a Spanish speaker might be confused.

Fluent English speakers who argue that "America" doesn't mean "United States" are usually just being obnoxious. I have never seen someone tell an Australian, a Mexican, a Chinese person, a South African, or a German that their name for their country is wrong. But for some reason many people like to say "America" is wrong.</text>

    <text>The term may not be, but doesn't the name of the USA imply a place called America which has States which are United? If there's no such thing as 'America' in English, then why is it not USNA? 

I get where you're coming from with the 200 years of convention thing, and I'm not advocating radical change. I just wanted to put forward the point that the founding fathers weren't particularly enlightened when they chose a name, and happened to choose one which claimed more than what the USA would eventually represent.

I also don't think any of your examples are very relevant. The USA's conundrum is that it implicitly claims the exclusive title of United American states- either that there are no other states, or at least they are not United. American is how both North Americans and South Americans describe themselves; I doubt anyone is culturally displaced by the Latin word for Southern, and at least SA is the southest country in Africa. Mexico is the opposite of the USA (the name of a small place used for a big country) whereas the USA is the name of an entire continent/two continents used for the name of a country. And China and Germany haven't claimed anything exclusive; there are many middles and peoples, but only one America.</text>

It's just the name people picked about 250 years ago. Nobody speaking English has used "America" to refer to the whole Alaska-TdF region for a very, very long time. The term used would be "**The** America**s**" or "New World." 

&gt;I get where you're coming from with the 200 years of convention thing, and I'm not advocating radical change. I just wanted to put forward the point that the founding fathers weren't particularly enlightened when they chose a name, and happened to choose one which claimed more than what the USA would eventually represent. 

People in the late 18th Century were not enlightened by the standards of 2023. Nobody will argue with you on this.

&gt;I am a fluent English speaker and I think the South Americans have a point on this; it's not l'm confused, it just seems discourteous.

It's just a naming convention that was made slightly awkward because different languages defined words differently. Nobody in the US intends it discourteously, and the other big group of Anglophones in the region (Canadians) don't consider "America" to include Canada. 

&gt;The USA's conundrum is that it implicitly claims the exclusive title of United American states- either that there are no other states, or at least they are not United. 

At the time, world powers didn't acknowledge any other states in the New World. Maybe it was dismissive of native peoples, but that's the way the world worked at the time.

&gt;American is how both North Americans and South Americans describe themselves;

Go ask a Canadian if they're American.

&gt; I doubt anyone is culturally displaced by the Latin word for Southern,

Nobody is culturally displaced in English. It was just bad luck that it happened to be an issue with Spanish.

&gt; and at least SA is the southest country in Africa. 

It's still a country claiming a name that could refer to an entire region. For example, "North Africa" is a region.

&gt;Mexico is the opposite of the USA (the name of a small place used for a big country) 

And the people in what was originally "Mexico" treated the people around them very brutally. It might seem objectionable to call people from outside ancient Mexico "Mexican." But nobody gets upset about this.

&gt;whereas the USA is the name of an entire continent/two continents used for the name of a country. 

Huh? "USA" is pretty firmly only used to refer to one country.

&gt;And China and Germany haven't claimed anything exclusive; there are many middles and peoples, but only one America.

That's the point: there are many countries that could call themselves "Land of the People" or "Middle Country." Yet the Chinese call China "Middle Country" and Germans call Germany "Land of the People." And nobody bothers them about it.

Another good example would be Colombia. The Spanish word ["Colombia"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_de_Miranda#Miranda's_ideals) (and the English word "Columbia") referred originally to areas much larger than the present Colombia. I live in what was once called "Colombia." But when I was in Medellín a few months ago I didn't walk around telling people I was Colombian or arguing about the name of their country with them.</text>

I'm NOT ignorant. I am fully aware that many indigenous names for themselves are essentially what we might translate as "human" which implies that they are the only true humans.

That fact is simply not relevant to the topic at hand, because "America" is just some random guy's name (Amerigo Vespucci) and has absolutely nothing to do with any implicit meaning which might be harmful to anyone or even an inherent implication of superiority.

    <text>How is it not obvious that I was objecting to your idea that the way a people or nation referred to themselves could be so harmful that people in another nation would be justified in demanding they change their endonym? The point of the example is that even in the worst real cases I could think of, where an endonym defines the members of the nation/tribe as “the people” and everyone else as implicitly lesser in humanity or “othered,” there is still no justification to demand they change. 

You’d have to invent something crazy like the name for a people means “we are the people who kill our subhuman neighbors.” That was why I asked you for a real example, because I don’t think one exists. I made that clear. I didn’t like your objection to OP because it wasn’t just the American case where it didn’t apply, but any case. Or do you have an example?</text>

    <text>In this OBVIOUSLY HYPOTHETICAL situation, it would be fine for the neighbors of "We are the people who kill our subhuman neighbors" to demand they change their name to something less insulting and provoking.

If you can't see how it would be completely reasonable in that IMAGINED SCENARIO, then you have a mental deficiency in empathy and/or the ability to view situations from multiple points of view.

I don't know, nor do I care, if this has ever actually happened. It's simply an obvious pedantic point I was making.</text>

    <text>You are having severe reading comprehension issues. I clearly stated that my hypothetical was the only case that came to mind where some other nation/people would be justified in demanding that the endonym change. The accusation in the second paragraph is thus based on a bad misreading. 

Your final admission that you were making a pedantic point is closer to what I’ve been arguing (or insinuating) all along. I would say: pedantic and without practical application to the real world. Unless you have an example I’m missing.

I realize I’m being pedantic towards you, but I’m ok being pedantic with a pedant.</text>

    <text>It's because most English people would just use American for citizens of the USA, so we know exactly what it means. The landmasses together are called the Americas in English, however we do not consider them as one continent so there wasn't a common need to use a demonym for the entire group.  We would instead refer to people as being North or South American, with some distinction of Central American and Carribean countries depending on use. 

I know that Hispanic countries tend to call them all one continent, but it isn't the case for us. It is like how we both make a distinction between Europe, Asia, and Africa even though they are connected together the same way North and South America are. The definition of a continent is culturally subjective, and different peoples will draw the lines differently. Politically it makes sense that Spain would encourage the unification of their territory while the British Empire would rather give their people a more distinct identity from the "foreign" colonies.

We like to pretend that we have things in nice neat boxes, but really there are so many grey areas and the rules break down when you look too closely at them.</text>

In latin derived languages there are terms like "estadunidense", which is accurate since the USA is the oldest "united states" and people from Mexico (United Mexican States) can call themselves Mexican while being accurate and not generating conflicts.

Calling someone American doesn't say from which country in America (the continent) are they from.</text>

The term “American” as it is used is pretty clear to me. If you want to refer to everyone from both North and South America in one go, you could use a phrase like, “people of the Americas” - it sounds a bit stilted but people would understand it. “People from the western hemisphere” presumably would too, though it sounds a bit odder than the former phrase</text>

    <text>Frank Lloyd Wright once proposed the word "Usonian" to refer to citizens of the U.S. as an alternative to American, but it never caught on, and is typically only used in Civil War discussions to refer to the Union.

I do agree with your point though that it's actually pretty rude to correct people from another country on what they call themselves, as if that's your right. There's this weird idea that people from the United States are an "acceptable target" to direct patronizing and insulting behaviors toward that would be considered offensively xenophobic when directed at any other nationality.</text>

I may be sheltered but if someone self identifies as an “American” while in another country has never been confusing or insulting to anyone. It’s how they labeled me when introducing me to others as well. “Meet supermaja. She’s an American academic at *** university.”

I understand some are offended by this label. I’m sorry about that. It’s used this way by everyone I know and have ever met. Fact is, I say I’m from “the US, state of Wisconsin.” 

Why people get upset about this is hard for me to understand. I never knew about it before now. 
Now that I know it, I’ll file it away for future conversations with any foreign nationals from any of the Americas, including South and North America.

I absolutely agree that cardinal direction make for a terrible descriptor for the US. Solely calling the peoples from the US "North American" makes no sense in a cultural context for example. But we are not limited to cardinal directions for distinguishing nomenclature! 

"US-American" is a name, I believe, to cause no ambiguity or upset. 

Since "US citizen" is common language, I don't see how "US- American" would cause any issues.

No, it isn’t.

North America is a continent. South America is a continent.

People pushing the six or five continent model are just being stupid about it. Needlessly ambiguous. 

In fact, that ambiguous continental model *causes* uneecessary co fusion about things like this.

Americans—being residents of the United States of America—get that demonym by virtue of the fact that we got first pick by being the first in either continent to gain independence from Europe.

Independent nations get to pick their own name, and their own demonyms.</text>

    <text>Everything you say make it even worst:

- Claiming the name which includes not one but TWO continents makes it even worst and appears arrogant and like a megalomaniac.

- The term „Americans“ and that it was implements by the colonizers completely negates the people who lived on these lands for centuries before the Europeans came. While throwing a fit about „US Americans“ you conveniently forget that the US took away the names of many independent nations.

*Eyeroll*

There is no ambiguity here. “American” refers to residents of the United States. “North American” refers to someone who lives on the continent of North America.

Only people who insist on needless ambiguity try to pretend there is just one continent called America.

&gt; The term „Americans“ and that it was implements by the colonizers completely negates the people who lived on these lands for centuries before the Europeans came. 

Are you’d seriously going to negate the existence of Native American tribes by trying to pretend the government that wages genocidal wars against them should steal their names in addition to their land?

It would be wildly, wildly inappropriate for the US government to refer to itself by their names. 

&gt; So honestly, that „Americans“ are upset about being called „US Americans“ triggers relatively little sympathy with me.

You’re free to be wrong, just like we’re free not to give a shit what you call us. We’re Americans, end of story. You can call us something else, but you’ll just be wrong.</text>

    <text>We are part of the [Organization of American States (OAS)](https://usoas.usmission.gov/). So, it is clear that we recognize other nations as "Americans" at the level of continental geography. We don't use the adjective "American" to describe their nationality. Nor do they use that as an adjective to describe their nationalities.   


Someone saying "Soy Argentino" can never mean "I am a citizen of the USA." In the USA, by contrast, saying  "I am American" can refer to either citizens of the USA or citizens of any of 35 nation-states.

In the USA though, saying "I am American" can't be interpreted as referring to 35 other nationalities as we're taught the 7 continent model as is most of the world (in addition to the combined Eurasia 6 continent model) meaning the majority of the planet recognizes 2 separate continents in the Western Hemisphere.</text>

Technically, perhaps, but not meaningfully; in English, American is widely understood as someone from the United States of America, not someone from the North or South American continents in general. It would be equivalent to someone saying that they're Eurasian, or Indian Subcontinental. It's just not how the language is used.</text>

That depends on which continent model you use. 

Some places traditionally view North America and South America as separate continents. Some don't. 

(Most famously, the five Olympic Rings stand for Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and the combined Americas.)

There's a similar deal with Europe + Asia vs. Eurasia.

If there is any merit to the idea of "Continents are a convention so if I am told and believe there's only one America then I'm right" then I can just as easily proclaim that there is only one continent period and it is Pangaea and therefore the term American can't have been appropriated from anyone as no one else has laid claim to it.</text>

If so, then that falls under the first poinot of being able to decide there as many as you want broken up however you want. If it's not a valid statement, then that means there has to be some form of governing body to say that 5 or 7 is fine but no other numbers. At that point then the governing body would be the source of truth, but there can't be 5 and 7 of the same thing so only one can be right. You can't have exactly 5 apples while also having exactly 7 apples. I guess there is the possibility that the word continent itself is being used with multiple different meanings, but invalidates the original point. It'd be tantamount to one person claiming there are 5 apples while the other disagrees and claims there are 7 oranges. The two terms aren't the same so it's irrelevant what either person thinks, but there is still only 1 actual answer for each of their terms.</text>

It's called the United States of America because when the English colonized North America they split the colonies into separate governing districts, referred to as States. When we declared independence the States referred to themselves as The United States of America as a way of saying the American colonies are united and free. Specifically referring to America because in the British empire we weren't the only  States, nor were we the only continent the British had rebelling states on. So speaking the English speaking world at the time it was unnecessary to declare North or South. Even today it's unnecessary. Mexico is the only other American nation with United States in their name. But this is where practicality meets culture. They don't say United States of Mexico because that's not how they say it in their language.</text>

I believe this confusion about one or two continents is motivating a lot of the problem people have here, because Spanish speakers (and probably some speakers of other languages) don’t realize we’ve got two continents, and we don’t realize they’ve only got one.</text>

    <text>I know people in the USofA who do this to them now. If you ask them to draw a map, they draw a vague semblance of the continent and call it Africa, basically cut the continent in half, and then call the top half Africa again and the lower half South Africa. With one guy I know, if you ask him about specific countries like Egypt or Sudan beyond that, he thinks they’re island countries off the mainland somewhere, like Hawaii in the US.</text>

    <text>Yet -the US didn’t rename itself in current times.  It was named two hundred years ago.  You are condensing time to compare that situation to current logistical issues with re-naming another country?  

Two hundred years ago, it took weeks to get a letter sent between Europe and the US.  The countries of North and South America were spread out and not as much was known about how large the land mass was, nor how many people inhabited those lands.  There was zero confusion, when referring to Americans as that moniker evolved, because there was zero international media.  (Btw, French was the main language of the educated, elite and those in international business, back then, not English.)

How about you tell us: what exactly about using the continent name in the country’s name back then was a “dick move”?  Because you are the one who hasn’t made a real or logical argument to be countered, frankly.</text>

I found out that some countries teach that there are only 6 continents and combine North and South America. I think most of them were South American countries.

But the fact remains.... people don't refer to their nationality as the continent they're on, but the country.

I might say I'm North American but if you ask me where I'm from I'd say I'm American.

Well, I have no problem with a Brazilian saying they're American, since they don't distinguish between North and South America for some reason, but if you ask a Brazilian where they're from they're going to say Brazil....

But, honestly, I think it was something started by white people like the whole Latinx BS and only started to spread to actual Central and South Americans because it seemed like they were supposed to be upset about it.

It doesn't help that those regions teach that there are only 6 continents and combine North and South America.

Is it *possible*? Yeah. Mexicans obviously know that Americans call *themselves* that? And I guess it wouldn't be suuuuper weird to hear something like "en Verano Cancún se llena de Americanos". Just casually used in a very broad general context dealing with a location kinda thing. It would still sound a tiny bit off/weird IMO but nothing jarring.

But a person?! People going around "¡oye, el Americano de reddit!" Wut. Lmao.

You're very charitable to suggest its regional, but personally I feel that this poor Americano (who btw visited his father sometimes) might be a little confused.  I am sure you are very grateful he told you about the word gringo tho, that must have been eye-opening 😉 

There's just so much about this that doesn't even make sense! History/ movies/books where Americano is distinguishing between Spanish born vs. Mexican born? Literally every. damn. form. of Spanish-speaking media I have ever heard in my very well-traveled life would *never* use Americano &amp; expect a single person to think E.E.U.U.? I feel like 90% correct that Mexico teaches the 6 continent model, right?

Maybe people just didn't really have the heart to correct the father/kiddo when they're telling anyone who asks that they're "Americano", &amp; people just roll with it since everyone knows what they mean anyways.</text>

If anyone has the right to be angry that Americans are calling themselves Americans it's Native Americans from all parts of the continent. 

But... THEY don't want to be called Americans, either, because they didn't call their land America.... we forced that name on them, like we forced the name Indians on them.

This is true, but you do often hear people referred to by their continents as well. For example, Asians, Africans, Europeans, etc.

    <text>Yeah, most all of which translate to American.

Until recently, anyway, when they started making up new shit.

We also refer to ourselves as North American, just as those other people refer to themselves as Asian and the like.

But when asked where you're from you typically refer to your country. If you're describing a social norm or something you might refer to your continent and then they usually divide it into regions because saying "Asian" could mean China, Russia, India, Vietnamese, Korean, etc. So a Korean might say "South East Asian" because that is very different from India or Russia, bit shares similarities with other SE Asian countries. 

I don't think I've ever heard an Indian refer to themselves as Asian, they always say I down, though I have heard them identify with Asian whentalking about Asians as a whole. Same deal with Russians. They are very staunchly Russian, not Asian.

Chinese people also prefer Chinese but will say Asian like we say American rather than North American.</text>

There are actually five Olympic rings, and depending on the definition there are as few as four and as many as seven continents. After all, if the Americas are a single continent, what's the justification for dividing Europe, Asia, and Africa from one another?</text>

    <text>The German was being an asshole by saying that American was an imperialistic identifier and therefore derogatory to the other people in the Americas.  However, we referred to ourselves as Americans prior to the American Revolution. Americans are the ones who cast off the imperialistic British to rule themselves.

Though we were Americans a majority still thought of themselves first as from their state and the larger nation second. So someone from Virginia would have first thought of themselves as a Virginian and then an American(like Robert E. Lee did). 

Perhaps OP needs to explain this to the German and suggest that the Germans in Germany are currently still going through the same thing. They are thinking of themselves as German instead of being an EU citizen. If we are supposed to come up with a term like USAian for ourselves then the EU mist as well. Perhaps EUnuch?</text>

    <text>People tend to suggest "North American" as the most acceptable demonym here in South America. In Brazil, where I live, some people also use "estadunidense", which can be loosely translated to "citizen of the United States".

I personally think it's not a significant discussion and doesn't aggregate anything in the grand scheme of things. Some South Americans fail to understand that English is a separate language and the US citizens have a different context than us. Also, some Brazilians take issue with being called Latin Americans, which makes them look like hypocrites when they don't like US citizens calling themselves Americans.</text>

    <text>Most geography textbooks, at least in Brazil, tend to divide America in three: South America, Central America, and North America. In this case, Central America is the landmass spanning from Panama to Mexico, plus the Caribbean islands.

So the usage of "North Americans" would be restricted to only the US and Canada. Since Canadians tend to use "Canadian" as their own demonym, that would leave US citizens as "North Americans" in this case.

But for people who really want to get into this debate, they usually call US citizens "estadunidenses", as I said previously, and Canadians "canadenses". I just call them Americans and Canadians because I don't really care about the whole imperialistic discussion</text>

Yeah, my impression is that the people who take issue with "America" being used to mean "United States" fall into two groups:

* Spanish/Portuguese speakers who know little English and don't understand that English speakers organize the world into seven continents.
* People who have seen Spanish/Portuguese speakers bring this up and decide it's a good way to be obnoxious.</text>

    <text>This is a fantastic way to put it, especially when we consider that other countries with similar names operate on a similar principle (see: The United Mexican States -&gt; Mexican). Of course no other country is named after the continent, but functionally the country is named “America” thus its citizens are logically “Americans”. At least in English, I agree with simply following whatever other language norms exist, such as calling them “Germans” in English.</text>

    <text>So you took over the name of an entire continent (or two), and you want other people to think of a replacement name for you? How about you think of your own name like any other group of people had to do in history? 

And by the way, Moab is not in fucking Utah, Paris is not in Texas, Toledo is not in Ohio. At least with Mexico, York and Orleans you had the decency to add a "New" before it. You guys have a problem with taking over other people's names. Get your own names. Cultural appropriation is not the same as culture.

    <text>I grew up in Germany and the term US-Amerikaner was used all the time. Meanwhile when I came to Canada and said “US American” a friend of mine looked at me and said “where else would they be from?!”</text>

    <text>In Germany there is a possible demonym for people from the US: “US-Amerikaner”, so literally US Americans. People can and do use that fairly frequently in my experience, especially in business context. 
But anyone who takes issue with just calling people from the US “Americans” has kind of lost it imho. Everyone will completely know what you’re talking about if you call yourself an American. 

TLDR: in German, there’s a linguistic possibility to specify you’re from the US, but it’s neither necessary nor expected</text>

    <text>As a German/American dual citizen and someone who has lived in both countries &amp; is fluent in both languages, I have honestly never in my life had anyone in Europe say this about calling oneself American. I have also never met anyone in Germany or anywhere else I’ve been in Europe who didn’t refer to people from the U.S.A. as Americans lol</text>

    <text>Ive never met a Canadian or Mexican who has been offended by the use of the word American. In fact, I've met plenty that have used the word themselves. United States of America -&gt; American, North America -&gt; North American</text>

    <text>Probably "US Citizen". I think Harvard changed their naming conventions to fit this as well</text>

    <text>Usually we use US-Amerikaner in Germany which would translate to US-american. That separates US citizens from inhabitants of the continent quite clearly</text>

    <text>Some people say “USian” which sounds incredibly dumb.</text>

    <text>They should have suggested 'USAtian'. America is a continent. USA is your country.</text>

    <text>As an American living in Germany, I’ve defaulted to using “US American” and that seems to satisfy most everyone. 

Also, I would make a point that the people “taking issue” is likely due more to their status as college students, than Germans or Europeans. As this conversation rarely if ever happens in my 30-40yo friend groups.</text>

    <text>From what I understand, "Europeans" believe we should refer to ourselves as North Americans because I guess Canada does not count either. That is what they have been calling us on the r/europe reddit at least.</text>

    <text>The ones who get up in airs about it tend to expect you'll say you're from the US or that you're a US citizen instead of saying you're from America or that you're American. In my experience I've never seen anyone get angry about it and the furthest I've seen anyone take it is to respond by asking the person if they're from all of the Americas or which part of the Americas they're from.</text>

    <text>I've used US American for years, since like Prodigy and AOL days.  

I admit saying it isn't smooth, but its not hard to write.  

People do tend to get strangely infuriated by it though, with no prompting but my using it. 

I was never pushing it or thinking it would take off when I started using, it was just a prefernce for greater accuracy on my part, still is.</text>
