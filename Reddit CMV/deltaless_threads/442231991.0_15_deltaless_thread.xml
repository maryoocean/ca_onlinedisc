    <title>CMV: Christianity is held together through fear</title>

    <original_post>My opinion is that if the fear of going to Hell was not present in the Christian ideology, then most of the followers of the religion would not be there.

Before I decided I was agnostic, that was my only reason for continuing to identify with the religion. Then, I decided I wasn't going to let fear control me. 

All in all, I don't see how this is any different than blackmailing a person to do what you want. You present your instruction, then tell them how you will completely devastate their life if they do not follow through.</original_post>

    <text>I don’t think it’s a fear of hell for most. I think it is more of a way to cope with life and death. And I don’t think  it’s  just Christianity, but all religions. I think people need to feel we have a greater purpose and that there is something more after this life. Otherwise we would all go crazy fearing death. 

Also, a true Christian believes you only get into heaven by accepting that Christ died to wipe away your sins and is your savior. Doing so out of a fear of hell doesn’t constitute true acceptance but rather a compromise. Therefore, believing in God because you fear hell, would actually cause you to end up there. 

Having said that, it would be difficult to prove if most Christians actually follow this flawed reasoning or not. </text>
