    <title>CMV: It's fair to compare carnists (people who eat meat) to nazis.</title>
    <original_poster>Arkenhiem651</original_poster>
    <original_post>1) Carnists think that animals are inferior; Nazis think that jews are inferior
2) Carnists put animals in camps; Nazis put jews in camps
3) Both jews and animals attempt to escape
4) Both are/were normalized. Anyone who goes against these beliefs were/are suppressed and treated as illogical/emotionally driven
5) Both are unnecessary 
6) Both are/were driven long distances and murdered
7) emotional detachment from the victims
8) Both are sentient
Alex Hershaft a holocaust survivor also used this comparison along with other vegan holocaust survivors.
"We're focusing on the victims rather than the cancer of oppression itself",[8] and that "I noted with horror the striking similarities between what the Nazis did to my family and my people, and what we do to animals we raise for food: the branding or tattooing of serial numbers to identify victims, the use of cattle cars to transport victims to their death, the crowded housing of victims in wood crates, the arbitrary designation of who lives and who dies — the Christian lives, the Jew dies; the dog lives, the pig dies."[6

Also Alex Hershshaft looks extremely young considering he's 88 and survived concentration camps. That's irrelevant but I thought it interesting enough to mention considering he claims it's due to his vegan diet.

Edit: I know I say Jews but this also applies to other victims of the concentration camps such as Slavic peoples, gays and communists</original_post>

Except the cognitive differences between humans and non human animals is... well... real.

&amp;gt;Carnists put animals in camps; Nazis put jews in camps  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;Both jews and animals attempt to escape

Points worth comparing if we were talking about cannibals who eat *people.* Or a society of vampires that puts *humans* in farms like in Seraph of the End. But we're not...

&amp;gt;Both are/were normalized. Anyone who goes against these beliefs were/are suppressed and treated as illogical/emotionally driven

Nazis weren't considered normal. Several governments sent army platoons composed of tens of thousands of men to put an end to the Holocaust and free the captured Jews.

&amp;gt;Both are unnecessary

Difference being that one has always been unnecessary and the other has only very recently been rendered unnecessary by medical and dietary developments. For most of human history, if you didn't get some meat in your diet, your odds weren't great.

&amp;gt;Both are/were driven long distances and murdered

Murder is the planned killing of a human being by another human being. One was murder, the other isn't.

The primary difference is in what the practice is being done to. A gardener is not a barber even though they both trim growing follicles for the purpose of aesthetics. Doctors aren't genocidal even though they dedicate their lives to quarantining and eradicating entire populations of living entities (parasites and pathogens). A soldier throwing a grenade is not comparable to a pitcher throwing a baseball even though they are both men wearing a uniform throwing an object with one arm at another man. You can't just scrub away the differences between two things to justify conflating them. Doing that, you can claim any two practices are functionally identical.</text>
