    <title>CMV: Not all gay people are born that way.</title>
    <original_poster>eltonjohnelway</original_poster>
    <original_post>First of all, I should make it known that I am not anti-LGBT and I believe that everyone should have equal rights and be treated fairly. I am straight but I do have a few gay and lesbian friends, coworkers, and family members. 

The common belief nowadays is that gay people are "born this way" and I can't find myself to completely believe this. I want to, as I want to be fully supportive of my gay friends. However, I am under the belief that who we are as people is almost completely defined by how we are raised and the experiences we have as children and through our entire life. IE- "we are the sum total of our experiences". I think that this expands to sexuality. I don't think there is anything wrong with this or that it is some sort of a mistake if you end up being gay. However, I do believe there is some alternate timeline/universe/ course of events ( whatever you want to call it) where certain people end up with different sexualities. In my opinion, my life could have been drastically different and I could have ended up being gay, but my cousin could have ended up straight. 

I am not trying to offend here, and I hope that it doesn't come off that way. I would truly like to have my view changed. Thank you!</original_post>

    <text>Your ideas tie very closely to the more broad nature-nurture idea. Back in the day it was popularly believed that the mind was a blank slate and it was solely our upbringing and environment that shaped us into the people we are with the personalities we have. 

Today it is supported that both genes and environment work together, constantly affecting one another. We are born with certain genes predisposed to certain traits, but our environment is always adjusting which genes turn on and off and when, due to factors like fear, anger, stress, and physical health. We are the sum total of our experiences AND what they do with our genes. On top of that, it has been found that sexuality can be hereditary. This does not mean a gay man's biological child will become gay, though, because the child's environment and individual traits will also affect it's sexuality. 

We are born with ingredients (genes) that when combined with our life experiences create something completely unique from anyone else. With the same environment and different genes comes a completely different person, and vice versa. Being raised in an environment that makes it okay to be gay is not the full explanation for someone being gay.</text>
