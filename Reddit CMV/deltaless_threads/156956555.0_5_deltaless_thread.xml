    <title>CMV: The campaigning to discourage shopping on Thanksgiving is not necessarily the morally correct thing to do.</title>
    <original_poster>championofobscurity</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've seen and heard several times this week the phrase "If I'm shopping on Thanksgiving someone is working." I don't think this campaign stands justified on it's own for several reasons.

1.) It assumes 100% of people don't want to work on Thanksgiving, and is a discredit to the people who do want to work as a minority.

2.) It assumes everyone celebrates Thanksgiving or has someone to celebrate it with. For some people this can be just another day as any other, and so the holiday inconveniences these folks at the very least.

3.) Tearing away those two things, It also may not get in the way of the holiday for the people who do and want to celebrate for them to work, and they get some nifty or needed holiday pay for their trouble meaning that it's not always a net negative for people that do have to work.

To conclude, the campaigning not to shop on Thanksgiving is not necessarily inherently righteous or positive, and from a moral standpoint might even be negatively affecting the lives of certain people if it gains any ground with the general public.

    <text>If no one shows up then the stores will not necessarily close down, they could just allow more people who wanted to spend it with their family to leave, and thoes who wanted to stay will rarely be forced to go.

At my work only 3 people can book any specific day off, and it goes in a first come first serve manner. I would personally love it if no one showed up on thanksgiving because they would let a few more people go home to their family and the lack of customers would allow thoes who had/wanted to stay talk and bond more.</text>
