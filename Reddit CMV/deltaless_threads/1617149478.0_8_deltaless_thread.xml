    <title>CMV: Tone Policing is OK</title>

Just from the get go, I want to say that I am rather on the left as opposed to being on the right or liberal. What I am about to say, therefore, is targeted as people who lean left but it is applicable to anyone. 

I have a feeling a lot people are going to disagree but here me out on this one but, I don’t really subscribe to the received definition of tone policing. If we go to my favorite source, Wikipedia, we find this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_policing). If you don’t feel like reading the whole thing, check out this quote: 

*Tone policing has been described by one writer as "when someone (usually a privileged person) in a conversation or situation about oppression shifts the focus of the conversation from the oppression being discussed to the way it is being discussed. Tone policing prioritizes the comfort of the privileged person in the situation over the oppression of the disadvantaged person."*

This to me seems a rather narrow definition? Tone policing is a lot of things. The term “mansplaining” is policing the tone of arrogant and pompous men with privilege who try to talk down to people. When we use the word “mansplain” we are criticizing pretentious men for their condescending tone. A similar case is the use of the term “Karen”. What are Karens? They are women who demand things in an overly aggressive and entitled manner or tone, right? I think that there are few rational people that would argue that men should never try to explain things, or women should never raise valid concerns about customer service. The terms “mansplain” and “Karen” exist to police tone. 

What’s more, no one likes being tone policed. Mansplainers would never admit that they’re mansplaining, Karens would never admit that they are Karening. And it’s not hard to understand why. When we use these terms, we are changing the focus of what they are they are trying to say to how they are saying it. We are not listening to them. 

But I would argue that’s OK. Because no one wants to listen to something that is being said in a rude, condescending or confrontational tone. Not your partner, not your kids, not your parents, not your teachers, not your students, and certainly not your audience. Tone policing is OK. 

But there is a qualitative difference when tone policing is done by privileged people to marginalized people, right? 

Yes and no. I understand that not everyone has equal access to power and a lot of people have perfectly valid reasons to lose their temper when someone inadvertently insults them in a demeaning and dehumanizing manner. However, this does not change fundamental facts of human nature and human behavior. Think about it for a second. People who are insulting can be insulting in one of two ways, purposefully and inadvertently. Let’s look at inadvertently first. 

Imagine that someone, an African-American woman, is offended by a middle aged coworker who uses some horrifically outdated and tone deaf but ultimately innocuous phrase like, “forshizzle”. Yuck.

And this is infuriating. I get that. But what is the proper way to deal with this? To shout at the coworker? To berate and belittle them? What will that achieve? Most like fear and resentment about being publicly embarrassed about something that they did not intend to mean as offensive. That does not mean that we should let the offending coworker off the hook. But it does mean that we should be careful with our tone. Because if we don’t, we run the risk of alienating a lot of people who might otherwise be sympathetic. 

What about people who are intentionally offensive? What about racists, white supremacists, and alt-right trolls? Surely we can unleash our rage and fury on them, right? 

Wrong. And it’s not hard to understand why. Just think about it. If you are someone who finds themselves on the non-Trumpian side of American and world politics, I’m willing to bet you love watching videos of Karens throwing tantrums, or popular subreddits like r/insanepeoplefacebook or r/neckbeards or which are devoted to mocking privileged and entitled people. It’s funny to watch people lose their shit, isn’t it?

So, if you are someone deplores the rise of bigoted, intolerant, nativist politicians (like me), you’ll probably want to police your tone and the tone of your ostensible allies a bit *more*, rather than less. Throwing a tantrum, calling names, losing your cool is playing directly into the hands of your opponents. You are making yourself look ridiculous when you do that. You are making yourself look like them. 

But, one might say, it’s natural and healthy to express anger and frustration. Perhaps, in personal relationships, but not really in professional settings and certainly not in political ones. We are in for a bumpy decade and the last thing we need is to act as though losing one’s cool is a righteous political expression. Let’s work more on being measured, calm and ruthless in the pursuit of our goals. Contrapoints has a great video about this. [Check it out. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuN6GfUix7c) And change my view. I would love to hear from people who think that tone policing is a bad idea.</original_post>

    <text>The article that you link to mentions that complaints tone policing are themselves a form of tone policing.  That works in reverse too:  Buying into some kind of abstract general notion of tone policing also tone policing itself, should be tone policed.

To me, it seems like thinking in terms of "is tone policing OK or not" is a fundamental error in the first place.   Things are more complex than that, and there are situations that call for sensitivity and gentle consideration, and there are situations where it makes sense to be deliberately offensive.  It all depends on what you're trying to get out of the situation and the sorts of behavior that are being prohibited.

Outside of meta discussions like this one, my - very limited - experience with people who actually talk about "tone policing" makes me think that it's hypocrisy pretending to be righteousness.   That said, it's easy to see examples of stuff where people leverage their ability to control the terms of debate.  I remember seeing a TV show that hosted a discussion between an old short print journalist with coke-bottle glasses and a young tall attorney in a slick suit, and thinking that it didn't seem quite on the level. 

&amp;gt; ... Let’s work more on being measured, calm and ruthless in the pursuit of our goals. ...

My understanding is that the "tone policing" trope seems to be about "the privileged" telling "the oppressed" how to behave, rather than being about self-discipline in pursuit of a goal.  So this seems like a bit of a straw man.</text>

    <text>Very interesting response...but why do you think I'm strawmaning?</text>

    <text>Maybe "straw man" is poor phrasing.  Let me try putting it terms of questions:

Is it "tone policing" what happens when 'the man' tells people how to talk instead of listening to the ~~content~~ things that they're saying?

Is it "tone policing" when people who are part of the same organization coordinate to so that they deliver a message in a consistent way?

When I read wikipedia, the article seems more about the first one than the second.   It quotes Ijeoma Oluo:  

&amp;gt; ... when someone (usually a privileged person) in a conversation or situation about oppression shifts the focus of the conversation from the oppression being discussed to the way it is being discussed ...

but parts of the view here seem to be more about the second than the first:

&amp;gt; ... Let’s work more on being measured, calm and ruthless in the pursuit of our goals. ...</text>
