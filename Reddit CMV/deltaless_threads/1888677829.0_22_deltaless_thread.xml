    <title>CMV: It's stupid to care about the environment in space.</title>
    <original_poster>MostRecommendation84</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm a big proponent of space colonization/exploitation and every time I bring it up there's someone who says something along the lines of "Oh we're gonna trash the Moon like we did Earth?" "Oh good more mining!" "Humanity won't rest until we've exploited everything we can!" and other snide comments to that effect. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Honestly, it just sounds like the dumbest argument to me and I wouldn't even be bothering with a CMV if I hadn't heard it so many times. *It's rocks. Uninhabitable barren rocks floating through vast chunks of literally* ***nothing****.* There's no space squirrels to worry about, we haven't found any aliens and we really have no reason to assume any are out there, let alone that they give a shit what we do to Mercury. Furthermore, you want to stop desertification or the human rights violations of cobalt mining, you're gonna be hard pressed to find a better solution than the absurd volumes of water and cobalt from here to the asteroid belt.</original_post>

    <text>You realize if we fuck up the moon too much with mining and shit it can come down  on earth.</text>

    <text>No, no it cannot. You are not comprehending the size of the moon and how far away it is from Earth.</text>

    <text>Why does the moon orbits the earth? The gravitational forces of the earth causes it too. So, if we have smaller pieces then the gravity forces of the earth could pull them toward the earth.</text>

    <text>Nope, they would still orbit the earth unless you arrest their velocity relative to earth</text>
