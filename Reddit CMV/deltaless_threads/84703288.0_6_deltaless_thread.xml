    <title>There is no good alternative to a democratic form of government. CMV</title>

    <original_post>I think all governments should be based on individual liberty and democracy. And statism, monarchy, autocracy, and dictatorships are ALWAYS bad.

I'm not going to elaborate on exactly why I think so, at least not here, I just want you to argue why I'm wrong.</original_post>

    <text>For your consideration, I suggest reading Hans Herman Hoppe's book [*Democracy: The God that Failed*](http://libertyactivism.info/uploads/b/b9/Democracy%2C_The_God_That_Failed_-_Hans-Hermann_Hoppe.pdf), for an excellent set of arguments why (if given only the two choices) monarchy is better than democracy.

As simply as I can paraphrase, kings run a privatized government (as opposed to today's publicly held government). Kings have a vested interest in seeing the wealth of their estate grow, which means taxing the people minimally, rarely engaging in wars, passing down stable finances to his heirs, and saving for future prosperity for himself. Presidents don't actually own the public resources, so they have an interest in depleting them as quickly as possible to win the most popularity from the public. Presidents don't have to be accountable for massive taxation or inflation or wars or shortages or famines; since We the People^TM appoint Presidents, our only recourse is to entrust another person to not screw things up. While Kings are held in check by revolutions, Presidents are held in check by re-elections.</text>
