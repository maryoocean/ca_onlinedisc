    <title>CMV: Legislative bodies should be required to explain, in formal writing, why they voted a certain way when it comes to legislation.</title>

    <original_post>I think publicly elected officials responsible for driving policy and legislation should be required to explain why they vote certain ways in writing. Voting along party lines is reprehensible regardless of the side. Politics shouldn't be a game about which side wins, but rather which fact-based opinions win regardless of sides. If the legislative bodies have no reasonable explanation for why they voted a certain way besides voting along party lines, they should not be allowed to vote because we have no reason to believe that they're not voting out of self-interest. If, for example, someone in Congress voted against what seems to be reasonable gun law without explanation, but you can see in their financial disclosure that the NRA contributes a lot of money and support for them, how are we to know that their vote was not influenced by the NRA without them explicitly citing so and explaining what other reason compelled them not to vote for said reasonable legislation? I'm not even asking for a long written response from them. A short paragraph or page summary with sources they're using to base their vote on is good enough. </original_post>

    <text>This is simply something that, if it were made law, would be unenforceable and impossible to regulate enough to be useful.

Each party would employ a team of writers to create boiler-plate phrases which the legislator could quickly build a reason from, or have a reason automatically created programmatically.

Such a system would not improve public understanding of why they voted a particular way, and would instead tend to obfuscate the reasons given by legislators that would have communicated without the law.

Such a law/regulation would create a lot more meaningless text to search through before you would find the few sincere words.</text>
