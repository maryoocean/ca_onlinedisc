    <title>CMV: "Likes," "Reactions," and "Upvotes" should be removed from social media sites.</title>
    <original_poster>AmigoDelDiabla</original_poster>
    <original_post>These reactions, whether positive or negative, reduce online engagement to anonymous, binary interactions.  They lack nuance, insight, or accountability.  And they are *wildly* misinterpreted in that they don't convey degree.  A high quantity of likes, or dislikes, just means a number of people saw and reacted to a statement/post/comment, but not the degree to which they reacted.  Especially in the event of downvotes/dislikes, I too often see the OP react as if that conveys hate.  Nah, it usually just means people disagree with you.

And it goes without saying how positive reactions can distort the owner's perspective of how his or her work is received.</original_post>

    <text>From who's perspective is this "should"? Are you suggesting that these companies would be more profitable if they removed these features, or that there should be some regulatory body that bans these features?</text>

    <text>You point out a valid flaw in my post:  I shouldn't have written that they should be removed, for the reasons you mention.  It shouldn't be regulated nor do I think SM companies would make more profit if they were.   

What I meant to say is simply that they're more harmful than good.</text>
