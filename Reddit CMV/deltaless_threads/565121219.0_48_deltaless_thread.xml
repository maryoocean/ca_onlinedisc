    <title>CMV: it is a jerk move to play music while camping within earshot of other campers.</title>

    <original_post>We put a tent up in a state park campground for about 4 weeks out of the summer. Most of the time you can just hear nature, people talking, kids playing, lots of birds and squirrels  . Every 5th day or so, there is someone who brings some Bluetooth speakers so they can listen to music , but loud  enough  that people in a half dozen sites nearby get to ‘enjoy’ whatever they are playing. 

Right now I’m cooking dinner and the guys next to me are playing U2, Dave Matthew Band and similar inoffensive crap.

This would be entirely normal in a backyard gathering, but once you reserve to be in a public campground, it becomes selfish, intrusive,  rude.

Am I wrong?

(I know it’s a known risk of car camping. I’m not really  mad. More rolling my eyes. I wish they’d shut that crap off.  )

    <text>This isn't just rude at a campsite, although it's perhaps especially egregious since it should be more obvious. It's always rude to play your shitty music in a public space, in such a way that people in that public space that aren't near you will have to listen to it. I'm

At a the park? Don't blast your music.
On the train/bus/plane? Don't blast your music.
Driving down the street with your windows rolled down? Don't blast your music.

I think some people think they are doing others a service. Like the way everyone enjoys their neighbors fireworks on the 4th of July. Some of these folks think they are helping out by livening up what was otherwise quite "boredom". 

This is why avoided camping over labor day weekend. Instead I took a couple days off and camped 4 days at Starved Rock here in Illinois. It's a very popular hiking and camping site around here, but I went mostly during weekdays. For most the our stay the campsite felt entirely abandoned, and we saw one or others people each day on the trails.

Near the visitor center, on the busier day (our last day) we encountered a two groups that were walking around the trails with music blasting from their phones, on speaker. This would have been really aggravated if we had been along side them for much of the trails. Luckily we only crossed passed once in each of the cases.

Heres my point. I think you should always expect this anywhere that people can casually access. The more people there are, and the easier it is to get there, the more likely you'll encounter it. I'm not saying your wrong to be annoyed, but I am saying that the point of camping is to get away from people, but you basically need to try harder. People suck, nature of great, that's why we camp. Go when it's less crowded, or where it's less popular, or where it's just harder to get to ( people who have to work harder to get somewhere, will be more likely to have cared more about *where* they are ). The unfortunate truth is that ultra casuals will camp/hike during peak times at popular places, and they are a lot less likely to respect nature / understand why what they do is offensive.
