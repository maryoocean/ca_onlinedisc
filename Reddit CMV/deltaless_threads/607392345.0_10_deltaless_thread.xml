    <title>CMV: Legislative bodies should be required to explain, in formal writing, why they voted a certain way when it comes to legislation.</title>

    <original_post>I think publicly elected officials responsible for driving policy and legislation should be required to explain why they vote certain ways in writing. Voting along party lines is reprehensible regardless of the side. Politics shouldn't be a game about which side wins, but rather which fact-based opinions win regardless of sides. If the legislative bodies have no reasonable explanation for why they voted a certain way besides voting along party lines, they should not be allowed to vote because we have no reason to believe that they're not voting out of self-interest. If, for example, someone in Congress voted against what seems to be reasonable gun law without explanation, but you can see in their financial disclosure that the NRA contributes a lot of money and support for them, how are we to know that their vote was not influenced by the NRA without them explicitly citing so and explaining what other reason compelled them not to vote for said reasonable legislation? I'm not even asking for a long written response from them. A short paragraph or page summary with sources they're using to base their vote on is good enough. </original_post>

    <text>Public officials already make these kinds of statements on most major votes via press announcements that no one ever notices.  They sometimes use citations and sources (since it's honestly not too hard to find at least one hack study to back up your point).

For your gun control example, legislators would just take a response handed to them by the NRA about why X bill was good/bad for their voters.  It's not like members would say "oh you got me, I only voted for this because I like NRA money".  They would say something about the Second Amendment, protecting their constituents right to self defense, and the same talking points you already hear every time the issue comes up in public discussion.

Additionally, there are many more bills than just the big ones that get attention.  Requiring officials to put out a cited response on why they're supporting renaming a post office in Rutabaga, Rhode Island isn't worth anyone's time and effort.

Since they already make press announcements about their votes on major bills this suggestion really only impacts the minor acts that no one would look up anyway.</text>
