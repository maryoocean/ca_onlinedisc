    <title>CMV: High school literature and history courses fail to provide meaningful educational value</title>
    <original_poster>dabears_24</original_poster>
    <original_post>In their current form, high school courses focused on history and literature fail to provide meaningful educational benefits. 

These classes commonly have a goal of improving critical thinking skills and develop advanced literacy. However, the format of current history courses where students heavily analyze past events, does not emphasize critical thinking, but rather focuses on memorization of history that has little to no significance in the present. Literature classes that focus on deep analysis of *important* texts like Shakespeare's works, complex poetry, or stylistic writing (i.e. stream-of-consciousness in "Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man") do not develop readinc/writing skills applicable to students' lives or modern texts. They also tend to foster dislike for reading when students are forced to extract meaning from texts they do not value or understand.

I believe a courses in debate, critical analysis of nonfiction works (i.e. argumentative opinion pieces), or even literary analysis of more familiar works would all be better alternatives to detailed US history or general literature courses.

Since this is a broad statement with caveats, I'll clarify in a list:

- I am not arguing the classes offer zero value. The concept of being in an educational environment likely has benefits itself, so my view will not be changed by arguments of the form "all education has value".


- I acknowledge the value of basic history lessons in understand society, culture, and history that affects us today. I am arguing that there is little to no value in all students having to learn of details like specific battles of the Civil War, or the politics of the early 1800s. These topics should be pursed electively.


- I am not arguing that these classes lack value only because they do not tie to future careers. I believe these two courses majorly fail to provide value. I agree that math and science courses do not necessarily tie into future work, but I believe they accomplish their goals more effectively.

I admit I may display a STEM-favoring bias due to my field of study and work, so I am willing to accept arguments that show that my view is a function solely of my bias and not of reason.

EDIT: Want to clarify that I still think history should be taught at a general level in school. I don't think it should be as detailed or exhaustive as a part of the core curriculum. In other words, I think the necessary history can be taught in fewer total classes

EDIT 2: Pretty late in the cycle now, but I'll add this regardless since I've engaged with a lot of arguments that misinterpret my post. I am not arguing against the value of History and Literature. I am saying these classes are ineffective in their current forms</original_post>

    <text>What goals are STEM classes acheiving more effectively that would mean they provide more value? Encouraging more critical thinking? Sure you have to figure out *which* formula to plug the numbers into in a science class, but it’s fairly straightforward from there and a lot of things are just memorization. There’s critical thinking involved in science, definitely, but in high school science we’re spending much more time learning what is already known and expanding on it. And I think there’s a lot of critical thinking in analysis of historical events and literature as well.

I don’t mean to throw the dictionary at you as a “gotcha” based on a technicality, but critical thinking is just defined as the objective analysis of facts to form your own judgement/opinion/argument. Even the most boring high school history papers involved critical thinking, because they required you to form an opinion of events based on your own research of them. As I see it, critical analysis by nature necessitates having the memorized facts. Learning why Robert E. Lee lost Gettysburg may not seem very important to the broader history, but Southern historians spent years disputing criticisms of Lee’s strategy that even Lee agreed were valid, as part of the revisionist history of the Lost Cause Movement. Why was Lee idolized so much? It requires understanding characteristics about him, and his actions during the civil war, that appealed to the Southerners’ views of their own society. And the Lost Cause was a remarkably influential school of thought for a long time (one could say its the reason people are still proud to wave confederate flags today). The particulars seem pointless in the face of the bigger picture, but they’re always a part of that bigger picture.

With literature, you seem to already acknowledge that there’s a lot of analysis and thinking involved  (correct me if I’m wrong there), but focus more on the applicability of this to “real life” and modern texts. I’d argue that a lot of modern texts (understandably) are influenced by and reference Shakespeare and other “classical”texts. And while a lot of English doesn’t help you in “real life” reading skills, a lot of STEM has the same problem. Learning how what is in my body works in biology, learning why adding x to y causes something to happen in chemistry, etc, involve a lot of applications to our lives. But I’d be shocked if I ever had to be able to name the IUPAC name for a compound, perform spontaneous calculations for how far this ball I’m about to throw will travel, or remember the full taxonomic classification of what I just ate.</text>
