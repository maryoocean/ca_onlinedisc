    <text>Define serious offense. Should armed robbery be punishable by death if no one was harmed during the crime? What about grand larceny? Should a person be automatically be put to death for stealing a tv? And what if that person didn't actually commit the crime? There are plenty of examples of people being put away on faulty evidence. Want to get rid of someone? Frame them a couple times. By instituting an automatic death sentence, you're saying the justice system is perfect and is capable of controlling life and death with impunity. </text>
