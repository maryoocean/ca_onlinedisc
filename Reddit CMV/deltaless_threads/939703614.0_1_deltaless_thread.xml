    <title>CMV: Where your born doesn't matter and country pride is pointless</title>
    <original_poster>Blank-VII</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't think I belong to a country and I think the concept is odd. I was born in the UK and have lived here all my life, but I fail to understand why people are so hard-core about being a 'proud brit' or anything. Where I was born isn't something I was able to decide for myself, and I want my life to be what I make out of it, not what it decides for me. I believe the only way to belong to a country is to find one whose culture is similar to your own tastes and opinions, and to move there. What's the point in being proud of a country I was born in if I feel no attachment to how it's run or anything else?

*you're

*View partially changed. Country pride is not pointless.

**Main view unchanged, it seems no-one can quite convince me. I've had some fantastic conversations and I'm really happy with how many of you engaged without being toxic. Stay safe y'all. Thanks so much!**</original_post>

    <text>Pretty fascist culture though? Lazio fans like a Hitler salute now and then.

I mean, if you're claiming it as the best, maybe having a fascist regime and being part of the axis of evil might go against that claim?</text>

    <text>No, you were making a claim of cultural inferiority by saying that it was fascist.</text>

    <text>No, they claimed it was the best. I merely mentioned that having had a fascist regime in your culture's past might not be evidence that Italian culture was the best.

Maybe Iceland would have a better claim.</text>

    <text>And most people would say that pointing to one disagreeable political movement in a country's past shouldn't define it. Politics is always a contested space.  


&amp;gt; Maybe Iceland would have a better claim.   


I would say that there are probably legitimate reasons why Italian food, art, architecture, fashion, music etc is revered around the world whilst you couldn't really say the same for Iceland.</text>

    <text>I don't know what this is supposed to prove. The article doesn't provide the specific questions that were asked nor does it give any sort of comparison to other countries. It seems as though it is being written with an agenda.</text>
