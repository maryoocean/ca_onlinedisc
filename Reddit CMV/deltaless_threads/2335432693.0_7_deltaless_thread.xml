    <title>CMV: all (US) roads that are not highways between cities or states should only have a single, one-way, lane of civilian traffic or less.</title>
    <original_poster>Square-Dragonfruit76</original_poster>
    <original_post>The main reasoning for my argument is because there at this point has been consistent, replicated, research finding that the more roads you add, the more traffic is actually _increased._ It would be a rough transition at first, but in theory, traffic would be diminished if you cut down the number of roads and the number of lanes. This would be great for the environment but it also would be great for everyone driving because there would be less traffic. The lanes that are no longer in use could be used to improve our society in a number of ways. They could be made into trees or park area. They could be restricted to only delivery vehicles and/or public transit or emergency vehicles. Or they could be made into bike paths. And if all goes well, perhaps people would even be open to eliminating some roads for civilian traffic all together.

Edit: Again, to reiterate, according to all the current research, more roads actually _create_ more traffic. So if anything, this would reduce traffic, maybe not immediately, but over time. A lot of people seem to not have read that part, so I'm not going to respond to repeats of people who clearly did not read my argument.

    <text>I (like most people) am all for reducing traffic. However, I think you're ignoring the drawbacks of your proposal. The reason that widening roads doesn't lessen traffic is because it allows for more people to travel to places that they want to go to. In general, this is a good thing! Cities (and the people who live in them) are richer and better off when people are better able to move around the city.

Your proposal wouldn't reduce traffic \*that\* much (unless you made driving a completely non-viable method of transportation), and it would make people meaningfully worse off by not being as free to move about the city.</text>

    <text>Eventually the systems would readjust to what they were before the additional roads and lanes were added. And if in the meantime the reduction of lanes caused an increase in public transport investment and stay at home jobs, all the better.</text>

That doesn't contradict my point. "What they were before the additional roads and lanes" was a system where fewer people went places they wanted to go.</text>
