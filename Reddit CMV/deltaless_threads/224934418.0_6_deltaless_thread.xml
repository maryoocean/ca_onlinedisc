    <title>CMV: French is the ugliest language on the planet.</title>
    <original_poster>Crayshack</original_poster>
    <original_post>When making a aesthetic assessment of anyone group of things, it is not that strange for one to end up on the bottom.  For languages, French occupies that position for me.  I would just accept this and not give it more thought, except for the fact that I will hear many people claiming french as one of, or possibly *the*, best sounding language on the planet.  I don't understand what they see in the language that makes it that appealing to them, and feel like I am missing something.

For perspective, to me French sounds like someone is trying not to vomit as they speak, and I can't think of anything appealing about how it sounds.  The best sounding languages in my mind is German, but there are a few others that are close enough to be effectively considered my favorite (including but not limited to: Swedish, Hawaiian, Russian, and Gaelic).

To get a delta, either find me a language that sounds worse than French, or give me reason to think that French sounds distinctly better than another language even if that language is not distinctly worse than some others.  I am discounting English and probably Spanish from consideration.  English is my native language, so it is difficult for me to make an assessment on how it sounds without considering the meaning of the words being used in the example.  Spanish is the most common second language where I grew up, so I learned some of it growing up and my opinion on it may be a bit clouded by experiences with communication difficulties between myself and people who spoke Spanish but not enough English.  I might be able to properly assess Spanish given the correct examples or perspective, but I would not count on it.

I will not accept a counter argument that my stance is not objective, because I think that aesthetics can only be assessed subjectively.  If you can argue for there being objective criteria, I will give you a delta.</original_post>

    <text>Besides the fact that you seem to generally like languages that most people find very unappealing if they don't understand them, you don't seem to understand that French is spoken differently in different places. 

In general people say they don't like German and russian because it sounds harsh and they use harsh tones while French uses more musical tones in practice.

Generally people also associate middle eastern languages with hacking and coughing but I think that is a stereotype</text>

    <text>I tend to like the harsh feeling from languages, but I can appreciate a musical sounding language.  In the examples of languages I like, I consider Hawaiian and Gaelic to be rather musical.  However, I don't get a musical feeling from French.</text>

    <text>I have heard what I have been told is several different dialects, but they all sounded very similar to me.  None of them had anything that made them stand out, including the presence of any musical qualities.</text>
