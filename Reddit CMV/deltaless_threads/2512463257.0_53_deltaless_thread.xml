    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

I think your standard of who's opinion matters is probably based on what people believe.</text>

    <text>“You want children to be able to have a private space to pray? Well you’re opinion doesn’t matter” - OP probably.

As an atheist myself, I had hoped the reddit brand atheist that just seeks to have all religious people be forced to have no self expression had died down. Absolute insanity.

And as for people talking about the resources spent on a room… how much do you think a prayer room costs? And does this apply to any other non-educational facility?</text>
