    <title>Childless adults should not go to Disneyland and Disneyworld. These are for children and families, and adults have the entire world to experience. CMV.</title>

    <original_post>As an adult of moderate means, you have access to the adventures and experiences that Disneyland (and related parks) simulate. You can go whitewater rafting, tour Czech castles and Parisian catacombs and sail the actual Caribbean. Disneyland is obviously an amusement targeted at children, and so adults without children should seek alternative forms of entertainment.

As a more practical addendum to the above, I gather that Disneyland and other parks are exceptionally busy, often resulting in long lines for the attendees. If adults without children eschewed them, then they'd actually be enriching the experience for the parks' target audience.

EDIT (Sept. 4, 19:00 CET): I'm afraid I'm out of time to respond to other comments--thanks for the conversation.</original_post>

    <text>The Hobbit was written for children.

Are you familiar with the concept of the Death of the Author? That it's the audience that dictates who derives enjoyment and meaning by deriving enjoyment and meaning, without necessarily caring about authorial intent. That concept applies to theme parks aimed at children, because as it turns out, lots of adults like roller coasters too.

And that's barring the nostalgia factor, which Disney may well be intentionally milking to bring adults in! I'm sure they haven't neglected the fact that a generation of the world has grown up on their IP.</text>
