    <title>CMV: When people say "white people can't cook" they're talking about Americans</title>

    <original_post>Sorry in advance if I make mistakes, English isn't my native language.  I was born in Eastern Europe and I find it slightly annoying when people of color mock white people by saying that we don't spice our food, that we can't cook, have no culture, etc. I understand that it's mostly jokes and I'm not offended, I even find it funny sometimes, but it still gets me thinking. 

If you look at white people from European countries such as Germany, Ukraine, France, Switzerland, etc. you'll see that we have a very rich culture and amazing meals with alot of flavor. Maybe this is just stereotypes, but from the google research I've done about American traditional (if I can call it that) food, it's pretty much stuff like pb&amp;amp;j sandwiches, pies and alot of precooked/canned meals. But seriously, when I think of a traditional American meal nothing comes to my mind, besides the americanized ethnic foods or fast food.

In general, I find it very annoying when people assume that all white people act like white Americans but it stands out the most when people talk about food and culture.

What do you think about this? Does this even make sense?

Edit: I also wanted to add that I'm not trying to offend anyone! I'm here to educate myself and see other's pov.
Edit: After reading the responses I realized that I didn't know that Americans considered foods from other countries as part of their culture, but it makes sense to me now!</original_post>

    <text>I've never in my 27 years of existing have I heard "white people can't cook.". I don't know whom you been speaking with or if you mean to say Americans can't cook due to dine-out and fast food culture. You definitely haven't looked hard enough at American cuisine as a whole. 

We got bbq like no other and it varies where in the country you're located. Americans are obsessed with sandwiches and fried food. The pb&amp;amp;j is an iconic basic sandwich but their are also the hoagie, po-boys, the hotdogs was reinvented in America  and you will get into fights throughout the country in how to assemble your dog. Phili cheesesteak legendary. Americans take what other people make and Americanise it, i mean look at an Italian Flatbread then look at American pizza. 

Getting back to white people not being able to cook. Who the hell said that? Asian, middle-eastern, African, Polynesian are good too but food isn't superior to others its all in a personal preference and mindset.</text>
