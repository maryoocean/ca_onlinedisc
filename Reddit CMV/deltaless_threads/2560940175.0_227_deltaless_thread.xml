    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>You can call yourself North American to relieve some of the animosity. Personally, when people call themselves American, I do tend to ask them if they are from Canada, the United States, or Mexico lol I do that mostly because I’m seriously curious. But I also ask that because I think I’m funny. 

Me myself, I refer to myself as a U.S. citizen lol but I’m also a part of a federally recognized North American tribe, so if they ask me where my family is from, since I look “different,” I elaborate that I look “different” because I’m Native American. Lol 

It’s all semantics really. 

But communicating is supposed to be fun, &amp; part of that fun is knowing what people are really asking - do they want to know where you were born? or are they asking regarding your ancestral makeup?

people huh. Always looking for a reason to get triggered. Lol
