    <title>CMV: Straight white males mostly children will think negatively of themselves in the future and we should try to combat it sooner than later.</title>

    <original_post>Let me begin with a few things

1. this isn't me looking or justifying the start of any kind of white, straight, or male pride day

2. this isnt me trying to cancel any pride day or month

3. please dont try to convince me of why your pride day or month is important or needed. I understand them and why they were created, etc.

I think that's it for the beginning. I just want to make it clear im not attacking any of that.

As prides and celebrations start to grow and become for celebrated I can't help but feel like it will become a problem for straight white males in the future. Not only is it the only group of people left out of this (which again I dont want it) its more about what you are told when you ask why it isn't. If you ask why being white isnt celebrated (its racist), straight (homophobic), male (misogynistic). So i think in time as kids start to ask why they have nothing like that and are told why they will automatically start seeing themselves as racist, homophobic, misogynists through no fault of their own and will then have a negative image of themselves.</original_post>

Should we have stopped Irish-American parades on St. Patricks Day decades ago because the Canadian-Americans are left out of it?</text>

    <text>St Patrick’s Day is an Irish pride day, seems pretty obvious why two pride events are compared</text>

    <text>St Patrick’s Day is also an Irish Pride Day, parades, parties, celebrations etc. 

Non-Irish people attend St Patrick’s Day events. Straight people attend Pride events</text>
