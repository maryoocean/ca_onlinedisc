    <title>CMV: Pride parades should have less NSFW content</title>
    <original_poster>punmaster29</original_poster>
    <original_post>To preface, I'm bisexual and I love pride month and pride parades. However, I think that the amount of inappropriate content impedes some of the intent behind pride. 

To me, pride is about celebrating the LGBT+ community and promoting acceptance and understanding. It's about not being ashamed of who we love and what we identify as, and being able to share that with the world. 

I think the parade would ideally be a great place to bring our families, to show parents and children how incredible and talented the community is. I'm not out to my family, but bringing them to Pride would be a great start towards warming them up to accept me. But generally given the amount of public nudity and sexual inappropriateness at Pride, this is pretty much out of the question. 

In order to be more inclusive and celebrate love with as many people as possible, I think pride parades should tone down the sexual undertones and focus more on the concepts of love, pride, celebration, and acceptance. </original_post>

    <text>If you belong to a group that people think is not normal, you can choose to react in two ways:

1. Trying to proof and argue that you are in fact are very normal.
2. Accepting that you are normal, and be proud of it.

The problem with choosing the first strategy is that if you for examle like a gay man say "oh, Im not flamboyant and feminine at all. Im really very normal, like you, and should therefore be accepted.", then you also saying that the men who actually are flamboyant or feminine is not normal and should not be accepted.  


I think the pride and the queer movements is about choosing the second strategy.

We are not normal, but why should you be that? We are here, we are queer, get used to it. </text>
