    <title>CMV: it is a jerk move to play music while camping within earshot of other campers.</title>

    <original_post>We put a tent up in a state park campground for about 4 weeks out of the summer. Most of the time you can just hear nature, people talking, kids playing, lots of birds and squirrels  . Every 5th day or so, there is someone who brings some Bluetooth speakers so they can listen to music , but loud  enough  that people in a half dozen sites nearby get to ‘enjoy’ whatever they are playing. 

Right now I’m cooking dinner and the guys next to me are playing U2, Dave Matthew Band and similar inoffensive crap.

This would be entirely normal in a backyard gathering, but once you reserve to be in a public campground, it becomes selfish, intrusive,  rude.

Am I wrong?

(I know it’s a known risk of car camping. I’m not really  mad. More rolling my eyes. I wish they’d shut that crap off.  )

    <text>At a public close quarters camp ground you'll have to put up with whatever noise others decide to make. This applies less and less as it gets later, but during reasonable hours you'll be the weird grumpy person if you tell kids to turn off their music.

If you want to hear nature and nothing else are there places you can camp that are much more isolated? Where I live there are plenty of places that you can only access after a long hike past other small campgrounds, but maybe that's not allowed in your state parks.</text>
