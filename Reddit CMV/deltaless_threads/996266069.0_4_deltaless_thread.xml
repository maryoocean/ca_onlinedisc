    <title>CMV: There is no reason a “God” should give Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>Protagoras67</original_poster>
    <original_post>I want to disclose that I am both an atheist and a hard determinist. I do not believe in any sort of creator and I have a hard time believing in Free Will. From what I understand from a Christian perspective, God gives humans free will in an effort to test them. But what i don’t understand from their point of view is why would God do that in the first place? Isn’t God omnipotent? God could just design the universe however it wants, we could have all been programmed to behave a certain way from birth and believe in God from birth and follow one religion as opposed to having a myriad of them. There is no reason to test us, it’s completely unnecessary.

Again, I’m not challenging anyone to prove God exists, I am just trying to understand the theological logic of this.</original_post>

&amp;gt;God gives humans free will in an effort to test them. But what i don’t understand from their point of view is why would God do that in the first place? Isn’t God omnipotent? God could just design the universe however it wants, we could have all been programmed to behave a certain way from birth and believe in God from birth and follow one religion as opposed to having a myriad of them. There is no reason to test us, it’s completely unnecessary

Imagine this:

I am a  world leading neuroscientist with a noble prize and the latest Tesla. You have no training in even general medicine. I tell you that mouth breathing is bad. Now i could just simply say it or I could require you to go thru 8 years of university + 2 - 4 years of residency + read all of my peer reviewed research papers.

God is described as a perfect being by a imperfect language(English,Hebrew,Greek,...) in and his message is interpreted by imperfect people (humans).

The idea that good gave free will as a test is our interpretation of what scripture projects and god in this way is similar to the world leading neuroscientist. What we believe is complex to understand for example the structure of a animal cell is like first year bio to the neuroscientist. The neuroscientist &amp;amp; god's knowledge are so vast that our current understanding doesn't allow us to question theirs properly

tldr;

god smart

human stupid

we think its unnecessary but because of our infinite ignorance and gods unlimited knowledge

 we basically dont know any better</text>
