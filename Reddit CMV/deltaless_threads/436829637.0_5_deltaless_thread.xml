    <title>CMV: Accusations alone should not be printed by the media.</title>
    <original_poster>OGHuggles</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't care what percentage of them are true, innocent till proven guilty is a thing. The erosion of privacy and civil liberties is of great concern to me now and in the future. While I'm glad plenty of women that would have been ignored before aren't anymore, I don't think accusations should be straight up believed. I think they should be taken seriously, but they should not get media attention until a case is actually made. 

False accusations are a thing and lives have been ruined because of them. The most infamous case of this guilty before proven innocent going wrong, is the Duke Lacross case I'm sure most people have heard of.

Why should I not be concerned about this? Why is it ok to ruin people's lives based off of accusations alone?

    <text>Even for the duke lacrosse case, some shady shit went down. The big problem there was that the prosecutor jumped the gun and stepped on the feet of the investigators. 

But lets put that aside for now... Could you say what big lesson you're taking from that case? No one knows the lacrosse team's names. They didn't serve any time. They were cleared to the point that you felt confident using them as an example of false accusations gone wild. But... if this was such a big problem, wouldn't something bad have happened to the people involved in your big, prototypical false rape claim example?</text>

    <text>The United States is founded on the principle of innocent until proven guilty. Our entire system is structurally set up in a way that favors defense. Any step taken that throws that fundamental system the other way, to favor prosecution, is a terrible thing. Normalizing these sensationalized criminal cases and having an entire country essentially assume the guilt of someone before trial, is a horrible thing. 

I don't think false rape accusations are some horrid epidemic. Statistically, rape accusations are usually true. False reporting is quite low, yadda yadda yadda. That doesn't mean we should just assume a person accused is guilty. What I am objecting to is the normalizing of sensationalized reporting on criminal actions. Whether that is rape, murder, drug dealing, whatever. Innocent till proven guilty is a thing. </text>

Actually that pretty much means that if we hear an accusation against somebody and don't have any compelling evidence either way, *we* as a society should probably believe it. That doesn't mean that legal punishment is required, but does mean that it's bizarre to advocate not believing victims if you acknowledge they're truthful far more often than not.</text>

    <text>If you are coming at it from a utilitarian perspective, statistically that is the way to go. I'm coming at it from a position of civil rights.</text>

    <text>How is advocating for mass censorship to protect the accused not a violation of civil rights? Why is it that you seem exclusively concerned with the rights of the accused, and not with those who might want to speak against him (or, y'know, prevent other people from being victimized, which is also a pretty big rights violation).</text>

    <text>The vast, vast majority of criminal charges are brought against the proper guilty party. There is a reason for this. The State cannot get an arrest warrant or indictment until they can establish probable cause that both a crime was committed and that the accused is more likely than not responsible. The State simply does not pull random people off the street and take their chances at developing evidence later on. The probable cause hearing occurs very soon after the indictment is handed down, within days- unless waived (commonly done once defense counsel sees the evidence in support of the indictment). Conviction requires a higher standard of proof and a criminal defendant is entitled to a jury trial before conviction and sentencing.  
  
It is a big deal and I certainly would be uncomfortable crafting a law that prevents the media from reporting on criminal proceedings. They take place in a public courtroom after all.   
  
The Duke Lacrosse fiasco is a good example. It took lies from the prosecutor to secure the indictment and thankfully those lies were exposed and the prosecutor rightfully suffered tremendously for it. </text>
