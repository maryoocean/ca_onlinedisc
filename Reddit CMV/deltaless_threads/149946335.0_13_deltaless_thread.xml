    <title>CMV:The Giving Tree is a story with horrible morals.</title>
    <original_poster>Sinreborn</original_poster>
    <original_post>I am currently having this discussion with my wife. Both of us had the book read to us as children and my wife now reads it to our 2 year old. I can't stand this book. I believe it to be the personification of entitlement. For those unfamiliar, a tree (most likely signifying parents) provides a boy with anything he needs until he takes everything the tree can give leaving only the stump. The boy is absent when he doesn't want things and openly complains about what the tree offers. There is no thanks given by the boy at anytime and no acknowledgement that he is damaging the tree beyond repair. 

I get the notions of self sacrifice that go into being a parent. I understand that I would probably do the same to make sure my own child lived a happy life. But I don't want to encourage this notion of desecration without though for stewardship or appreciation for the gifts being given.

Please change my mind so I can stop fighting with my wife.

    <text>I can only tell you how I felt having this read to me regularly as a kid.

I hated it

My mom read it to me constantly and would cry while doing so in this manner I can only describe as self-pity.

"One day you'll get it, one day you'll be a parent and you'll know everything we do for you"

It made me feel horribly guilty at an age so young I don't think I should have been thinking about that kind of thing.

I don't know if it teaches entitlement, but it is very heavy.

I find it beautiful now, but sometimes I wish my mom had just read me some god damn dr. suess</text>
