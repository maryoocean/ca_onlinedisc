    <title>cmv: There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as an “American”</title>

    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>Mexico is on the continent of North America. Are they Americans? 

Central America considers themselves Americans. Are they? 

It's confusing.</text>

    <text>Technically anyone on the American continent is an American and can call themselves that. You’d have to use context clues to determine if they are referring to being a US citizen or if they are from a South American country.</text>

    <text>There are two American continents, North America and South America. If a Brazillian wants to say they are South American, that's fine. If a Mexican wants to say they are North American that's fine. But to just say "American" in English is unambiguously referring to the United States of America. No clarification needed.</text>
