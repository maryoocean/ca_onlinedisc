    <title>CMV: Ivory confiscated from poachers should be destroyed, not sold to fund Elephant/Rhino conservation efforts.</title>

    <original_post>Hello CMV,

A post popped up in /r/worldnews today about [how Kenya has confiscated and will burn $270million dollars worth of poached Elephant Ivory](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/439fg2/kenya_to_destroy_largest_ever_ivory_stockpile_in/).  Many of the comments stated the opinion that this is a waste to burn it, and that the product should be sold at a very low price, to flood the market, and to raise money for conservation efforts.

I believe that destroying the Ivory is the best solution.  The sale of Ivory was banned in 1989, and the two legal sales that have happened since have [revived the demand in the markets that they were sold](http://www.economist.com/news/international/21595932-push-stop-poaching-and-save-elephants-extinction-up-smoke). 

Many people compared destroying the product to the ineffectiveness of similar practices in the drug war. Drug manufactures can afford to lose a large percentage of their shipments because the profit is so high, and most profitable drugs come from plants, or other resources that are renewable and not as scarce as Elephant Ivory.

I would love to hear your opinions, and will be taking them in to full consideration. Feel free to make suggestions about other potential solutions I haven't considered here.  I have an interest in (but limited knowledge of) economics, feel free to use macroeconomics to explain your view!

So, Change My View Reddit.

    <text>So I guess I kind of come to this with a "use all the buffalo" type of thinking. I can see potentially the issue of selling the ivory, but I do umbrage with destroying it. I mean, these animals were killed for this ivory, by destroying it you've turned their death from one for materials to now one that has no meaning whatsoever. I mean, if someone killed you so they could steal an arm from you, would you want it destroyed and no one have it, or at least some one could have it?

It's just feels a waste of both material and life. </text>

    <text>I wouldn't feel comfortable with other people deciding how to use my arm. I'd want it destroyed.</text>

    <text>I agree with your point, but I can absolutely tell you right now that if someone killed me to take my arm I'd want that arm immediately destroyed.  </text>
