    <title>CMV: Christianity is held together through fear</title>
    <original_poster>M1STER_B0NES</original_poster>
    <original_post>My opinion is that if the fear of going to Hell was not present in the Christian ideology, then most of the followers of the religion would not be there.

Before I decided I was agnostic, that was my only reason for continuing to identify with the religion. Then, I decided I wasn't going to let fear control me. 

All in all, I don't see how this is any different than blackmailing a person to do what you want. You present your instruction, then tell them how you will completely devastate their life if they do not follow through.</original_post>

    <text>The core of Christianity is to live through the actions of thousands of people over thousands of years in one giant book. The Bible is people like you and me making mistakes and living life in the worst and best ways. The lessons learned show us our nature and our tendencies to live life a certain way. I was an atheist for reasons like you until I realized my criticisms of Christianity were surface level and had the maturity of a 15-year old trying to rebel against daddy's traditions. When I approached it again, I understood the depth of community, virtue and unity to live life the best way possible and to bring my family to church every Sunday. It's made my life better, my family more united and all of us bigger contributors to society. 

Does Christianity have the potential to be abused? Absolutely. But with every religion, we see abuse and things taken out of context to hurt and undermine people. We see attacks in the name of God when God never tells us to kill each other for no good reason. Being an atheist really isolates you but being agnostic just never was something I personally liked. With God exists and I need to see my place in it or he doesn't and I move on with my life. At this point, it's undeniable which path will be best for me and everyone around me. Being agnostic might feel like the burden of Hell is lifted off your shoulders but perhaps one day you'll realize that Hell isn't a place you go after you die, Hell is your life and it's the bad consequences that come to fruition once you start living a life that has been proven time and time again doesn't work. Now this isn't an attack to you, I don't know you and I don't know your story but I do know that me and you are very alike. All of us are alike and we all have the same fundamental desires. The Old Testament is a journey through thousands of years of trial and error to live the best life possible. </text>
