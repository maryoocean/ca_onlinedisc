    <title>CMV: EA's current feature of buying heroes with credits in Battlefront is not outrageous or even out of the ordinary.</title>
    <original_poster>PeterPorky</original_poster>
    <original_post>EDIT: I've changed my view partially because I think BF2's situation is indeed unique, though I think the option of a grind that is comparable to many other games makes it not worthy of outrage.

So the situation is that in EA's new Battlefront game, the internet as a whole is outraged that players must play 40 hours to unlock Darth Vader, or to pay money to unlock that character.

I think this outrage is ridiculous, since paying for the ability to play as characters or to have other abilities is standard in other games, and that playing dozens of hours to unlock characters and abilities in other games is also standard, and has been for a long time.

Examples of pay-for-character/pay-for-ability games:

1. CoD (unlock the level 65 weapon day 1 with pre-order)
2. Most MOBA's
3. Team Fortress 2 (very comparable loot crate system)
4. Age of Empires 2
5. Newer fighting games with other characters as DLC

Examples of play-for-character/play-for-ability games:

1. CoD (you must level up for a wider selection of weapons, perks, killstreaks, etc)
2. All MOBA's
3. Team Fortress 2
4. Super Smash Bros. series
5. Older fighting games
6. Goldeneye

Unlocking characters after long lengths of play has been a part of games since forever. In Super Smash Bros. Melee you'd have to complete 1,000 online matches to unlock Mr. Game and Watch (or spend dozens of hours completing difficult challenges). Mortal Kombat's Crypt system also had players playing for dozens of hours to accumulate credits to spend to unlock characters at the Crypt. Age of Empires and MOBA's have some characters/civilizations on free rotation, but you must pay money or grind countless hours in order to unlock characters/civilizations.

Unlocking characters or weapons by paying money instead of grinding to get them has been part of games since microtransactions have been a thing. The combination of the two has been a thing for just as long.

The outrage against EA is just part of another gaming echochamber source of outrage against another industry standard being blown out of proportion by an ignorance of looking at how things have been. CMV.

    <text>I think the problem here is that you can take the easy way and pay without any effort. It would be very frustrating for someone to play the 40 hours of grinding and then see a low level player with that hero just because he took the easy way. Also if i remember correctly, buying Darth Vader was more expensive that the own game.

Its true that other games do this, like Rainbow Six Siege, but none of them have such a high price. Basically EA is pushing the F2P mechanics inside an AAA game. A game that has not enought content to enjoy before getting tired or bored. 

Also, People seems to hate EA because they release a game along with Dlcs that is just parts that they themselves cut off the game. Have you ever played The sims without any dlcs? The lack of content is felt from miles away. </text>

There is no straight way to pay for Darth Vader. You can unlock him *randomly* via a loot crate or get meagar amounts of credits from loot crates. So a player can pay anywhere between $5 or infinity dollars for Darth Vader, or grind for approximately 0.5 Mr. Game and Watches to unlock Darth Vader.</text>

Thing is, with the Battlefront hero system, that new player doesn't have free access to that hero. Heroes in the main gameplay mode are unlocked on a per match basis. You earn points by kills and objectives, you get enough, you play as the hero. That person who has played 40 hours is going to know the maps inside out and kill the guy who just paid constantly. The people who skip progession are not going to be getting a huge advantage.

While this is generally a problem with EA, it's not necessarily relevant to this outrage considering that they have announced free DLC for this game rather than paid. </text>
