    <title>CMV: Religion is just Peer Pressure from Your Parents</title>
    <original_poster>siddharth_pillai</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't think most people believe in their religion. Nor do they believe in the gods they worship. They simply believe in whatever their parents believe. If you're a theist reading this, ask yourself whether you'd still follow your current religion if your parents were Islamic?

You can speculate yourself, don't you think its more likely that you would be Islamic too? If your parents were Hindus, wouldn't you be a Hindu? If your great grandparents were Sikhs wouldn't your parents and in turn you also be a Sikh?

It may not be true for all but its true for an overwhelming majority of people.

Edit: I'm getting some answers asking about people who convert or have non religious parents, my views don't apply to these people</original_post>

    <text>So each religion is actually an accumulation of thousands of years of documentation on how one should live your life. It is no more your parents than the current society/culture you live in. The rules and the moral framework on how to navigate in a society is what the religion provides and is more so reinforced by the society you live in. Also even though you may be atheist you still abide by the moral framework within your culture. Take western culture for example it is built upon very similar principles that are an extension of Christianity such as the respect for the individual over the collective. Which actually is represented in loads of different aspects of our lives. 

It’s not just a spiritual book as a lot of people believe, but it’s the combination of thousands of years of figuring out right and wrong. Now not everything is right in the book because it’s slow to change but a lot of the abstraction meta analysis is what you see in your everyday.</text>
