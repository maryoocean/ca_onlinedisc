    <title>CMV: Sugar is a drug and thus should be regulated(i.e. limited in products for both adults and children, especially the latter)</title>
    <original_poster>kfijatass</original_poster>
    <original_post>I believe sugar should be regulated.   
1) First off, Sugar *is* a drug. [It is addictive, it has withdrawal symptoms if you do not consume any over-time and has negative effects on one's health; diabetes, obesity and dental issues being just a few of the issues.](http://authoritynutrition.com/10-disturbing-reasons-why-sugar-is-bad/); even [sugar-free drinks are of dubious effects on health, with acesulfame k, aspartame, sucralose and other artificial sweeteners being proved to be of dubious effects on health, unhealthy in larger quantities and possibly affect cancer/diabetes rate.](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-drinks/artificial-sweeteners/). Saying that the amount of sugar in products is one of the main reasons behind western world's obesity is not unreasonable, especially as the [amount of sugar increased over the years in daily products, shifting a typical man's diet severely](http://authoritynutrition.com/11-graphs-that-show-what-is-wrong-with-modern-diet/).  
2) Sugar is in all daily products, [the sugar industry lobby is strong](http://www.psmag.com/politics-and-law/the-not-so-sweet-side-to-the-sugar-industry). You cannot rely on the market to create a worthy competitor to sugar(unless [L-Sugar](https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-L-sugar-left-handed-sugar) becomes a thing one day) precisely because sugar is so addictive which make people buy more of the said sugary products. In worst case scenario, the only real competitors would attempt to make their products equally addictive, which is not a good thing for any consumer involved.  
3) You cannot trust people, especially children to make educated decisions on drugs they're addicted to. Especially now, as sugar penetrated the market to the very point adults and children both are addicted to sugar, you cannot trust addicted parents to take care of sugar-free diets for their children; nor can you control children with pocket money in school shops or cafeterias. This is precisely why the move should come from above; if you'd, for instance, try to make an alcoholic a non-alcoholic the first thing you'd do is move away the alcohol from him, not just try to convince him it's unhealthy while he's surrounded by alcohol in every kitchen shelf.  
4) Naturally, sugar regulation would likely have dire short-term effects, especially on the economy, but in the long-term it would help the society, serve to deal with obesity, dental issues, diabetes and more and would as a result yield a healthier, and thus more productive society. It is therefore in the state's interest to intervene on this subject if they care for the long-term economy and society.    
5) That said I am uncertain what would be the most optimal way to regulate sugar; removing sugar from schools and banning selling soft drinks to &amp;lt;13 year olds seem a decent move - something alike was introduced in [Russia](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2923705/Children-banned-buying-fizzy-drinks-Coca-Cola-Dr-Pepper-Russia.html). ~~Introducing a sugar tax for sugar products could be another way.~~(Nevermind because this would affect raw sugar, not my intent) The most radical but probably the most effective way would be to regulate amount of sugar per 100 ml/100 g/3.5 oz in all products sold and reduce it to a reasonable level like ~5 g/0.2 oz(5%~) with an exception made for pastries and other wholly-sugary products; something alike was introduced, albeit only for children in [UK](http://www.epha.org/a/2554).  
6) *added point to clear confusion* Since sugar is essential to most diets in reasonable amounts, I do not suggest a sugar ban nor a reduction that would affect raw sugar. I merely advocate regulation of added sugar where its presence is not necessary, such as soft drinks and most market foods with added sugar but NOT e.g. pastries and NOT regulate natural sugar products such as fruit/juices. I do NOT wish to regulate carbohydrates, merely added sugars.  
7) Assuming drug regulation of alcohol, cigarettes and other drugs both soft and hard is valid for their respective health and societal concerns, sugar is comparably uncontrolled in terms of regulation and therefore deserves more regulatory attention especially considering comparative health and addiction risks.  
8) I admit I did not consider basic foods in the equation, I mostly was concerned with added sugars in sugary drinks and foods that do not require it in large amounts, such as cereal, yoghurts etc and not basic foods such as bread.

That said I believe sugar should be regulated. CMV :)

    <text>Who are you to tell me what I can or can't put in my body, and in what amounts?

&amp;gt;It is addictive, it has withdrawal symptoms if you do not consume any over-time and has negative effects on one's health; diabetes, obesity and dental issues being just a few of the issues.

Your source says nothing about any withdrawal symptoms whatsoever, and the only part that talks about addiction says it CAN be addictive for some people.  Video games can be addictive too.

&amp;gt;even sugar-free drinks are of dubious effects on health, with acesulfame k, aspartame, sucralose and other artificial sweeteners being proved to be of dubious effects on health, unhealthy in larger quantities and possibly affect cancer/diabetes rate.[2

The source you cited says essentially none of that. Here's the first sentence of the article:

&amp;gt;The health benefits of artificial sweeteners are inconclusive, with research showing mixed findings.

Doesn't exactly seem proven, to me.</text>

    <text>States ban drug usage on a regular basis; if you'd compare sugar to other drugs you would notice there is little to no control over sugar while there are many controlling factors on the likes of alcohol, while the negative effects are comparable in scale, albeit it might seem otherwise since how sugar affects the body more over-time than nearly immediately as it is with alcohol.  
Here's a few sources on withdrawal symptoms:  
[1](http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2014/07/19/sugar-withdrawal-symptoms-list-of-possibilities/), [2](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-give-up-sugar-10081689.html).  
As for artificial sweeteners, research is mixed and inconclusive. "Generally safe" is how it's described. [There were some theories](http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/artificial-sweeteners-fact-sheet) as to the link to cancer risk. Not proven either healthy or unhealthy way, is how I'd put it. But I'm not going to hold this point as my point referred to added sugar anyway.</text>

Right, but I'm of the mindset that I should have complete bodily autonomy, including the right to use drugs, if I would like to.  As long as I'm informed of the consequences, what business is it of yours if I shovel sugar into my mouth 24/7?

&amp;gt;Here's a few sources on withdrawal symptoms:

Your sources leave a lot to be desired, especially if they're the cornerstone to your argument, considering one is literally a blog listing "possible" side effects that are so vague literally anything could cause them.  

Your other source cites a study done on rats (not humans) after depriving them of food for 12 hours each day.  It makes sense that the rats would prefer calorie-dense food, as that would give them the best chance for survival in the short term.  That doesn't demonstrate that it's addictive, only that rats prefer it to normal food when starved.  Hardly the most conclusive evidence you could provide.</text>

    <text>It is the state's business that you are a healthy, productive member of society.  
Naturally you may disregard such care and do so regardless by eating said raw product(and not added sugars against which I advocate in this thread), but that argument shouldn't stop states from caring.  
I admit that particular study might seem shaky since it concerns rats and not humans, so it may seem enough to me but I am okay with that not being enough for you.

    <text>No, it isn't, especially if it involves legislating my intake of certain types of food. That's a nanny state. 

If you truly believe that, where does it stop? Should the state be able to force you to take medication against your will so that you will be a healthy, productive member of society? </text>

    <text>There's reason in any care measure a state undertakes. A ban would be unreasonable, but a reduction in added sugars on products not necessarily requiring them is not considering its effects; in the end nobody is holding your hand.  
I think you slippery sloped a bit from incentives/disincentives to forced enforcement and the latter's not my intent.</text>
