    <title>CMV: There are no good or bad music genres, just good or bad artists.</title>

    <original_post>I get it. Rock is your favorite music genre, you hate country or pop. Whatever it is, it doesn’t make your favorite genre “the one”.

Music is like food. There’s pizza, hamburguers, sandwiches, tacos, burritos, nuggets, etc. That doesn’t make one better than the other. But there are people or restaurants that can make great delicious pizzas and others who make average pizzas. The same way, there are amazing rappers with great lyricism and rhythm, and others who use an overproduced beat and have poor lyricism. There are Metal guitarists with great technique and years of experience, and others who don’t.

And this whole “my favorite genre is better than yours” thing applies to almost everything: books, videogames, movies...</original_post>

    <text>Taste is completely subjective.

But we can look at this issue in an objective way: is Beyonce better than Freddy Mercury, if Beyonce doesn't write her songs, and instead a dozen other people do, while Merucury does write his own songs, and is well versed in several musical instruments?


So which is better based on these criteria?

Some people don't care, but for many, integrity is important in music.

Not even to mention that most rock/metal songs, ballads, for example, have a lot more feeling in them.</text>
