    <title>CMV: Life is meaningless, and there's no point to trying to prolong it as much as possible.</title>
    <original_poster>ragdala</original_poster>
    <original_post>Whatever we do, ultimately, has no meaning. In the grand scheme of things, we are but a tiny speck of dust on a meaningless planet.

That's why i say that trying to prolong life is absolutely useless. This includes tries to reanimate dying people, trying to find a special formula for immortality, and similar medical/engineering advances.

Instead of finding ways to prolong life, we could better spend resources to make the life we've got more pleasurable. This would be a much better way to spend our time and resources, by actively trying to become a better and happier society, where death is just part of the cycle, with no taboos attached to it.</original_post>

    <text>If life has no meaning, I can do whatever the hell I want to with it. If that means kill myself, then I kill myself. If that means prolong my life, then that's what it means. If there is no meaning, there is an equal value to either of these stances. Hell, if I wanted to, I could flip a coin and let it decide for me and it would mean just as much as if I made the decision for myself.

So my question to you is, if life has no meaning, what's the point of spending resources to make the life we've got more pleasurable? After all, we are just a tiny speck of dust on a meaningless planet. If we're all going to die anyway, what value is there in pleasure?</text>
