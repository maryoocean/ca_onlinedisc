    <title>CMV: We could better manage agricultural resources if safe appetite suppressants were recommended (even supplied) by the FDA.</title>
    <original_poster>Soycrates</original_poster>
    <original_post>If the government began to suggest that appetite suppressants were a normal, healthy, and even recommended part of the daily diet for teens and adults of all ages (save extreme seniority), we would consume less agricultural resources on average, learn to better manage these resources to reduce starvation and hunger (when applied with humanitarian interest groups), the US populace would spend less money on healthcare, and people would choose their meals more wisely, opting for fresh and non-greasy food choices.

This is not motivated by a hatred or disdain for the image of people considered overweight or obese - some people would still appear to be overweight due to genetic and environmental factors, as well as the possibility for lack of exercise - and should not be considered a "the world would be better without fat people" opinion. The world would be better if we could learn to eat primarily for sustenance instead of pleasure. [Being overweight has been identified as a cause of cancer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight#Health_effects), and is projected to overtake smoking as the primary cause of cancer in developed countries as cases of cancer linked to smoking dwindle. Our health and finances would greatly improve.

We would reduce the amount of environmental damage that is caused by the agricultural industries as well, preserving land and water and creating a culture that could more easily foster eco-friendly practices and biodiversity.

The only people not expected to take appetite suppressants would be those whose RMR (Resting Metabolic Rate) was below normal.

That, right there, would be the most unhealthy proposition ever. We learned this with substituting formula for breast milk due to government "coaxing". We've also learned this from industrial processed sugars, fats and proteins. Screwing with our nature screws us up. We are animals, we are supposed to eat stuff when we're hungry. Using a chemical to bypass that part of our nature, institutionally, is asking for much more trouble than the meager, far-reaching benefits you hope to achieve.</text>

    <text>The point is that this mechanism has obviously failed in obese people. Of course that injecting insuline sounds like a bad idea when you are healthy, but if you have diabetes, it can keep you alive.</text>

    <text>The mechanism hasn't failed, the food supply has. Feeding people factory engineered fat, protein and sugar is what we done wrong, starting with formula at birth. Science *has caused* the obesity epidemic. I don't see how more science could be the answer.</text>

    <text>It doesn't matter if you eat "factory engineered" food or "natural" food. Weight gain/loss is based almost entirely on the number of calories you consume and expend, not where said calories come from.</text>

    <text>&amp;gt; Screwing with our nature screws us up.

Screwing with nature has drastically increased life expectancy and drastically lowered infant/child mortality.

&amp;gt; we are supposed to eat stuff when we're hungry.

For 99.99...% of human evolutionary history, we've been constantly on the brink of starvation. When starvation is *a thing that can actually happen*, it's beneficial to gorge yourself and build up fat reserves whenever there's food available.

Nowadays, it's practically impossible to starve, but evolution is slow, so our bodies still attempt to build fat reserves for times of famine.

Thankfully, we've also evolved complex brains which give us the willpower to resist basic urges. Sadly, some people choose not to take advantage of this ability, and turn into blimps.</text>
