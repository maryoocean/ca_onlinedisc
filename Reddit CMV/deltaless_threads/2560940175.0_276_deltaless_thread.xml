    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>I also refer to people from the USA as Americans or use the terms ‘America’ and ‘USA’ interchangeably while living in London, and the British will have a go at me for it. 

If a Brit said they were European, nobody would say that’s disrespecting ‘Europeans’. Just like Americans will say they’re ‘from the States’ or ‘American’, both can be true. Could also look at Arabian countries - several have the word ‘Arab’ in the name but I don’t think one gets upset over the other referring to themselves as ‘Arabs’.  

Tbh these people complaining are from England, who live within the United Kingdom, and call themselves British. In other countries you have Germany = German, Australia = Australian, Brazil = Brazilian, etc yet then you have the odd balls in the UK who have zero cohesion.. they’re in no place to comment on this lol</text>
