    <title>CMV: Rap Music Sucks</title>
    <original_poster>chronicallyfailed</original_poster>
    <original_post>So it may just be that all the rap I've listened too has been bad, but I really can't think of a rap song or a song featuring rapping that isn't just unlistenably bad. 

The lyrics, even when they're not breathtakingly sexist and homophobic, tend to be boring, unimaginative crap along the lines of "my penis is big and I do drugs" - not that I have anything against songs about penises and drugs, just the way it seems to be done in rap that I've heard is just boastful and repetetive.

Musically, I just hear incessant, grating melodies played over a shitty drumbeat while someone talks over the top of it. A lot of the time I don't really see how it qualifies as music.

Also, the amount of ridiculous, pretentious crap in the music videos just makes it hard for me to take them seriously at all.

But I don't really want to just dismiss rap music like that, so please explain to me how it's not shit, and examples of it not being shit would be nice too.

    <text>Try some more thought provoking/'smart' hip hop. There's obnoxious, repetitive rap out there, same as any other genre...but there is also PLENTY of artistic, creative, interesting stuff out there also.

The boastful, offensive 'gangsta rap' from back in the day is something I also happen to like, but much more selectively - mostly the classics like Dr. Dre's 'The Chronic', NWA's 'Straight Outta Compton', Snoop Dogg's 'Doggystyle', etc.

The Roots are probably one of the best examples of more modern and creative hip hop. Common, Mos Def, Outkast, Jurassic 5 would be other artists to try, off the top of my head. Try out Jay Z's 'Unplugged' album. 'Blakroc' is an excellent rock/rap collaboration album if you happen to like The Black Keys.</text>
