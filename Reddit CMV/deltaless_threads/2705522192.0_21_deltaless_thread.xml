    <title>CMV: Bodybuilding is stupid</title>
    <original_poster>RaindropDripDropTop</original_poster>
    <original_post>I want to be clear, I'm not talking about lifting weights in general, I'm specifically referring to competitive bodybuilding, especially when it involves cycling a bunch of gear (using PEDs), and getting to dangerously low body fat levels and severe dehydration to go on stage.  

I definitely recognize that competitive bodybuilders have insane levels of dedication and training. It is without doubt incredibly difficult to achieve those type of physiques, even for people with top tier genetics who use PEDs. Even the most genetically blessed and steroid enhanced bodybuilders still work insanely hard. I am not doubting their work ethic and drive. What I think is stupid about it is why do people think that this is worth it. 

For starters, it is purely for the sake of vanity rather than athleticism or strength. A bodybuilder might look absolutely insane, but functionally speaking, actual athletes who train to maximize athletic ability have way more physical capability depending on what sport they train for. Whether it's strength, speed, endurance, acceleration, vertical leap, flexibility, dexterity, or a combination of all these things, bodybuilders just aren't nearly as physically capable as actual athletes who put in similar time and effort into their training.

On the topic of vanity, bodybuilder physiques don't even look attractive or aesthetically pleasing. Obviously this is subjective, but the vast majority of the population is way more attracted to a healthy athletic physique than they are to a bodybuilder physique. I get that bodybuilding isn't really about looking attractive, rather it is about pushing the limits of what is possible with the human body, but it's honestly kind of just a freak show.

The biggest reason bodybuilding is stupid is that it is insanely unhealthy. Even for natural bodybuilders who don't use PEDs, they are still getting to dangerously low body fat levels and becoming extremely dehydrated in order to achieve their stage physique. This is incredibly taxing on the body, and it's extremely common for bodybuilders to suffer severe health issues because of this. For the ones who do use PEDs, which is basically a requirement to become a top level bodybuilder, the damage to health is even more severe, and they suffer many side effects as a result, especially ones who are not properly educated on the drugs they are taking.

One might argue that bodybuilding might be worth it for the money, but the reality is that only the top few bodybuilders in the world are making significant money through this career. The vast majority of bodybuilders, especially amateurs and people who do regional or local shows, aren't actually making much if any money through this. They also have to dedicate insane amount of time and effort into training, and if they are using gear, they are spending a ton of money on drugs. Moreover, there are similar alternatives to bodybuilding that are way more lucrative and more accessible to most people, such as becoming a fitness influencer or something (not saying that many people can break into that field either, but it's more achievable than making money through competitive bodybuilding).

The reason I am asking for my view to be changed is because I want to hear opposing perspectives, and maybe someone can shed some light on what I am missing. Like I said, I respect the work ethic and drive of bodybuilders, I just have a really hard time wrapping my head around it. I totally respect people's rights to do whatever they want with their body so long as they aren't harming others, I'm really just trying to understand the mindset of a bodybuilder, or at least understand what the appeal is.</original_post>

    <text>As far as your attractiveness point (limiting my answer to heterosexuals for convenience):

While the *majority* of women will say they don’t find bodybuilder physiques attractive, the fact remains that the number of women who are very excited to fuck a man who bodybuilds remains far greater than the supply of men who have those bodies. It’s less about achieving broad universal appeal, and more about finding and appealing to an extremely enthusiastic and under tapped niche.</text>

    <text>I can guarantee you that the vast majority of women who are into big strong muscular guys actually prefer the ones that have healthy athletic physiques rather than a body builder physique, especially the physiques that body builders have when they are actually on stage.</text>

    <text>You seem to have missed the point. 

Supply. Demand. 

Vast majority of women prefer more normal/average body types. 

But some don’t. For example, some women prefer fat chubby guys - however, the number of chubby guys is HIGHER than the number of women who desire them. Thus, bad outcome for chubby guys. 

By contrast, even though a majority of women DON’T prefer bodybuilder physiques, the number of women who DO prefer them is far greater than the number of men who have them. Therefore, bodybuilding men will have a much easier time getting laid. 

In addition to all this - a lot of people say/believe differently than they do. Lots of women and men will SAY what type of body type they prefer, and then when confronted with the type of cartoonish body type they say they aren’t into, their tongue will fly out of their mouth and their eyes will turn into hearts like a cartoon wolf.</text>

    <text>No, you missed the point. The women you are talking about aren't into bodybuilders specifically, they are into big muscular guys. You don't have to be a competitive bodybuilder to be big and muscular. I'm not even talking about normal or average body types, I'm talking about super big and muscular guy who have healthy athletic builds. 

There are no women who actually prefer the bodybuilder physique. Seriously just look at pictures of Ronnie Coleman, he looked grotesque when he was on stage with his dangerously low body fat and sauced the fuck up muscles. There are a lot of women who like guys that are big and muscular, but that's not the same thing as liking a bodybuilder physique where they have dangerously low body fat and are super dehydrated</text>

    <text>Buddy, these guys get laid. They get laid a lot. 

If only 2% of women are into these guys, and only 0.5% of guys look like that, then those guys will each have four women to fuck. Does that math make sense? It’s about supply and demand. Low demand but even lower supply means you’re still selling out.</text>

    <text>You still aren't understanding what I'm saying. 

I'm not saying that they don't get laid. I'm not saying that these guys are unattractive when they are just walking down the street during their offseason. I'm talking about the physique they actually have when they are on stage after they did their cut and dehydrated themselves.</text>
