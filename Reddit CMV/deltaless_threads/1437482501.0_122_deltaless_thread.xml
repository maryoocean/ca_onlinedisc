    <title>CMV: Kink and BDSM should not be at public pride events and should be kept for 18+ ones</title>
    <original_poster>akoudagawaismywaifu</original_poster>
    <original_post>To start, I am a lesbian. And I've been seeing recent controversy about this topic. 

Look, no denying that kink plays a big role in the creation of pride. It is a part of embracing sexuality and shouldn't be excluded from the community. 

However, it should not be at public pride parades. Pride should be for everyone of all ages. Many people say "stop catering to the straight capitalized ideal of what pride should be" and "pride isn't a party, it's a protest don't police us" and "children should go to disney if they want family friendly" This has nothing to do with straight rainbow capitalism. I figured out I was LGBT at age 11 and trust me if I saw a kink act in public I would be kind of disgusted. I'm still a minor now, and I'd be less disgusted but still. I know people say that it's up to you to bring your children to pride, but by making all pride events "wear whatever you want even if it's nothing" we are also kinda excluding minors from it. It's also non consensual to anyone who is exposed to such acts, because nobody wants to go to pride to see naked people right? The "think of the children" phrase holds true here. Young children and teens embracing their sexuality shouldn't be forced to see adult acts against their will. 

Again, no denying the role kink plays in the community, but it should be kept at 18+ events. There should definitely be a separate pride for people who just want to do leather and other kinks. That way, you can do whatever you want in a safe space where you know you won't offend others, and because people consented to come to an 18+ event, it's all good. 

That's just my personal opinion on it, but it seems to be the minority. I'd like to see how you guys think about this.

Edit: it appears after reading and responding to several comments, I don't really have a problem with kink, but more with public indecency. I don't care if you wear a collar or leather pants. But I'd rather not see things that could get you arrested or questioned for doing in public.</original_post>

    <text>Im a straight man, but have gone to pride events in the past and may do so in the future to support LGBTQ rights. I don’t particularly want to see or support bdsm or kinky sex practices at all. My opinion is that its none of my business and Im fine with it being yours, but would prefer that kept behind closed doors, where all other sex acts take place, in private. I I would never dream of going to a BDSM or any other kink convention, straight, gay, or what have you. 

Im not asking anyone to be anything theyre not, except perhaps appropriate in public. What this means to me is that any act considered acceptable by straight couples in public is totally acceptable by gay couple, or threesomes, etc. But I dont want to see folks waving around dildos, exposing themselves, flaunting whips and collars, or anything overtly sexual from anyone, straight or gay.

I should be able to support LGBTQ rights to not be discriminated against, without witnessing or condoning whatever sex acts happen to get them off. It would also be wonderful for the cause if I felt comfortable bringing children to a PRIDE parade, to teach them about diversity, acceptance, and to hopefully make them comfortable around the LGBTQ community. Whips, chains, and dildos make that difficult to impossible. Its not because you’re gay, its because many of us still think sex should be private. 

I get that some may chafe against the idea of catering to a society theyve been oppressed by, but the reality is that there are certain rules to being in public, and its a whole lot easier to defend and support LGBTQs when theyre able to meet basic decency requirements. Id like to support gay marriage, equality at work and elsewhere, trans rights etc., but a hyper sexualized parade doesnt seem like the way to do it.
And maybe thats the whole problem in a nut shell. LGBTQ people are just people, and they have different thoughts, opinions, and priorities about what a PRIDE parade should be. I bet many would agree with me ( its not like the majority of PRIDE marchers are wearing assless chaps), and of course others may insist that they must express themselves sexually in public or theyre being victimized? 

I back what I think OP said: have a day time, public, pg-13 parade to celebrate queer identity for everyone. Then, later, have an invite only, no holds barred, no dress code celebration, out of sight of the general public. Not because you should hide your identity, but because as a general rule, society doesnt want people doing kinky sex stuff in public, no matter what the flavor.</text>
