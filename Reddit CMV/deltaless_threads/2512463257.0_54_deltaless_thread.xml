    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>Forcing people to not wear something that is very important to them is pretty despicable. You seem to have no concept of basic personal freedom. Someone wearing a hijab or a necklace with a cross doesn’t affect anyone else in any way. You’re confusing secularism with prohibiting any form of religious expression, which is actually not secular at all.</text>
