    <title>I don't think the NSA spying on us is such a big deal. CMV</title>

    <original_post>Here is my reasoning: growing up parallel to the development of the internet my parents always warned me that anything you put into a computer someone out there can see. It is permanent. So I have always assumed there is always someone watching. That assumption at the end of the day hasn't really changed what I put on the internet because everything is strictly my opinion and I don't care what others think of it.

As far as the recording of phone conversations and storing of email, that is just a case of national security. these things need to be saved in case someone is planning a terrorist attack on our nation IMO.	

I am just a normal citizen like many of you, but my opinion differs on this subject matter and I want to understand what the big fuss about it is. It has always just been a common knowledge and understanding for me that I am being watched.</original_post>

    <text>Imagine that an FBI agent came to your door and interviewed you about all the people you called in the past month. The agent asks who you called, where they were, were you were at the time, how long you spoke... and maybe, if he feels like it, what you talked about.

This agent then goes on and asks all the people you called. This agent can build a network of all the people you know and all the people they know- or, at least, who they call.

Every month, you get visits from these inspectors. They aren't looking for anything in particular, just something, anything, suspicious. And they talk to _everyone_. You, yes. Your family. Politicians, actors, veterans, doctors, children, reporters, nuns... everyone who uses a phone, everywhere, has to tell these government men everything they do with it. Call a phone sex place? Well, that's going on the record. No, it's not illegal. But it's going on the record.

And if, hypothetically, an agent somewhere, or maybe a general or a politician, ever decided that, say, Communists, or Christians, or Jews, or Muslims, or the Japanese, or Reddit Users were _The Problem_...

I'm not saying it's certain; I'm not even saying it's _likely_, but _if_...

But that's not the real reason this is bad. It's conjecture, it's paranoia. The **real reason** this is bad isn't the potential abuse of the information; it's the inherent wrongfulness of treating literally every citizen of the United States as a suspected criminal. That's the problem.</text>
