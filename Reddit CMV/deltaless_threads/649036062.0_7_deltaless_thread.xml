    <title>CMV: Regardless of your view on abortion everyone should support universal access to contraception</title>
    <original_poster>Bagool88</original_poster>
    <original_post>Like the title suggests, I think that supporting increased access to contraception (especially birth control) is in everyone's best interest regardless of whether they are pro-choice or pro-life. If you're pro-life, easier access to contraception ensures that lower rates of unwanted pregnancies which should then lead to fewer abortions. If you're pro-choice, nobody *wants* unplanned pregnancies to occur, they just want women to have the option available so that a mistake doesn't ruin their lives. 

That being said, I don't see how anyone could be against increased or even universal access to contraception and birth control in particular. Yes condoms are readily available and cheap, but 1) condoms don't feel good so a lot of people make the stupid mistake of not using one, and 2) [birth control is more effective than condoms](https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/bc-chart.html). It seems that both sides would either benefit from or support fewer unwanted pregnancies, so why would anyone ever not support increased access to contraception? 

Edit: Wow this post blew up overnight. Most of the arguments I'm seeing against my view is that since condoms are both cheap and easily accessible that we do have some form of universal access to contraception, or that universal access to the pill would inevitably mean that it would be provided through tax dollars. My problems with this are I've said, condoms aren't immensely effective and work ~ 82% of the time, and while not wanting your tax dollars to go into funding the pill is absolutely a valid and reasonable view to have, neither of these views actually solve the problem of how to prevent unwanted pregnancies. I'd like to open up the discussion and ask those of you opposed to funding the pill with tax dollars how you would propose we lower the rates of unplanned pregnancy. If anyone can come up with a reasonable solution that doesn't involve the use of tax spending I will gladly give a delta. Thanks for the reasonable dialogue so far everyone!                </original_post>

    <text>If you believe life starts at conception, then it makes sense to be against all forms of abortative birth control including the pill and the coil.</text>

    <text>Actually, that's incorrect!

The copper IUD is basically an ultra-effective spermicide. If you have a copper IUD, sperm is killed before it reaches the egg. Therefore, there is no conception -- because no sperm make it to touch the egg.

Likewise, the pill prevents pregnancy by *preventing ovulation*. The sperm are free to float around, but they don't actually reach any eggs. Thus, the pill doesn't produce a zygote either.

The type of pill that doesn't prevent ovulation (known as the "mini-pill") also prevents life at contraception by thickening the cervical mucus. Sperm can float around freely in the vagina, but can't go into the uterus. So it's impossible for the sperm to touch the eggs, therefore no zygote here either.

Almost all modern birth control methods (besides plan b and abortion) are actually designed in such a way that 'conception' doesn't happen at all. Because the sperm cells never reach an egg cell to fertilize.</text>

    <text>No, if you're going to stand for something that would ruin millions of lives you need to be able to back it with hard evidence and they can't </text>
