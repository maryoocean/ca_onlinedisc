    <title>CMV: Now that we have evolved past the need to eat meat, it is completely immoral to do so.</title>
    <original_poster>Inquisitive2k</original_poster>
    <original_post>Not a vegan or even a vegetarian, but I still hold this belief. I understand that we have evolved as carnivores, and that eating meat has always been essential to human survival. It holds nutrients you cant find anywhere else like B12, its heavily saturated which makes it an efficient food, and ot tastes damn good (which i would guess has something to do with evolution aswel).

These arguments are still valid in underdeveloped or poor countries, and under extreme conditions. However, in modern day western society's I can't seem to find one ethical argument for eating meat (not to mention the toll it takes on the environment). 

Is everyone just lazy like me, or is there more to it?</original_post>

    <text>What about species superiority? If one of your axioms is that humans are specifically supposed to use other living things for almost any reason, doesn't that make it ethical within that framework?</text>

    <text>Yes, exactly, but as soon as we leave that framework it becomes something else entirely.</text>

    <text>You said you can't find one ethical argument. Are you saying that I found one even if you disagree?</text>

    <text>Its not a valid argument because you left the premise stated in my post. My premise is that we don't need to eat animals, therefore it is immoral.</text>
