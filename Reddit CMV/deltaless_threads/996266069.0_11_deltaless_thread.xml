    <title>CMV: There is no reason a “God” should give Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>Protagoras67</original_poster>
    <original_post>I want to disclose that I am both an atheist and a hard determinist. I do not believe in any sort of creator and I have a hard time believing in Free Will. From what I understand from a Christian perspective, God gives humans free will in an effort to test them. But what i don’t understand from their point of view is why would God do that in the first place? Isn’t God omnipotent? God could just design the universe however it wants, we could have all been programmed to behave a certain way from birth and believe in God from birth and follow one religion as opposed to having a myriad of them. There is no reason to test us, it’s completely unnecessary.

Again, I’m not challenging anyone to prove God exists, I am just trying to understand the theological logic of this.</original_post>

    <text>Well think about what you would do if you were a god? Christians basically anthropomorphise the unknown force that created the universe, saying "what if the big bang was a human?". Well, humans need entertainment as well, and the universe is *way* more entertaining if people have free will. If you already determine what everyone is going to do, it's not fun to watch, you may as well just skip to the end.</text>
