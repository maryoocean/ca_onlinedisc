    <title>Cmv: Companies should not volantarily raise wages</title>
    <original_poster>omar1759</original_poster>
    <original_post>A company (specifically one that has many investors such as publicly traded companies, but also private ones) that is already able to recruit AND KEEP more than enough quality workers at a given wage should never decide to volantarily(meaning without being forced by market conditions that cause labor prices to go up naturally) raise wages solely on the basis of helping workers. This is because generally speaking a company's moral duty should be to maximize profit for it's shareholders and basically labor is an expense just like utilities and companies are supposed to minimize expenses to achieve this duty. 
This btw does not include small businesses where the only investor is the one owner of the business rather than a group of investors. 
In that case the owner would be free to raise wages as he wishes however unintelligent that may be. I still it is not a smart decision to raise wages significantly above the market rate in this situation if you are looking at the overall good. A small business with more profits can expand the business and hire more workers.
However in this post I am still trying to focus on businesses with many investors and how it is morally unacceptable for the board of directors or CEOs to decide to raise wages more than necessary to hire enough quality workers.

Edit: I just want to emphasize I'm talking about raisiwages when the current wages already help recruit more than enough high quality workers, because people are responding saying that paying workers enough helps them be more productive.. I already took that into account.. If you need 50 high quality workers and you can get them at $12 you should not raise wages to $15 if it won't make much of a difference in quality and if your only objective is to help workers financially or "provide a living wage"</original_post>

    <text>There is some truth to this, but there are lots of exception.  The responsibility you're referring to is the fiduciary duty of the board and executives.  However, "value" is complicated.  The board and shareholders might _value_ higher wages because of their social concerns in which case a - for example - smaller monetary dividend is less _valued_ then the impact of fair wages.  This is _aside_ from arguments that you'd agree with I think that are that the brand might benefit, or better employees might be attracted or retained.  

We are seeing this sort of thing with environmental responsibility - e.g. shareholders express their want for responsibility and as shareholders you can't say they are "wrong", even if you think the _monetary return_ would suffer.  Value is expressed by vote, and it's the fiduciaries responsibility to deliver on that value.</text>
