    <title>CMV: Capitalists hates the free market</title>
    <original_poster>SulemanDawood</original_poster>
    <original_post>Big businesses hat the idea of smaller companies rising up and challenging their market dominance which is why they try their absolute hardest to buy out every single startup they can. FAANG companies are notorious for this. They spend absurdly large sums of money which could be used to innovate on pointless mergers and acquisitions to avoid having to deal with the 'free' market. This is true even in the EU. The recent rise of Chinese EVs is driving european EVs out of the market and these companies are actively seeking to get them banned to save their own skins. Google, Amazon and Apple all continuously engage in anti-competitive practices to drive out competition because they can't deal with the fact that they can not innovate like smaller firms can. In the end capitalists are the ones destroying capitalism.</original_post>

    <text>Smaller companies are capitalists as well, and without capitalism those smaller companies would likely not even be created. Small companies are the engine of free market capitalism. 

I’d even take that a step further, that most of the larger companies are able to get so large because of crony capitalism. Basically utilizing the government to create regulations and limit growth allowing only the bigger companies to survive. Take the pandemic regulations as an example. The rampant government involvement caused many small business to fail, but behemoths like Amazon were thriving. It was government overreach that topped the scales to the “big guys”.</text>
