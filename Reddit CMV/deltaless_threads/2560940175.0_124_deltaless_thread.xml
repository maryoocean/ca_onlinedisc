    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>The only people I have ever argue this, are people trying to start an argument to be a pain, or people who hated America. On the side of people starting fights, I always have made them say the entire name of the country they were from, it lasts about five or six times until they acknowledge it’s a dumb argument. 

People from other nations in the western hemisphere are proud of their heritage and their nations. They don’t call themselves Americans, they call themselves Brazilians, Hondurans, Mexican, Peruvian, Canadian and many others. And many do come here and become Americans but that doesn’t change they are also Brazilian  &amp; etc. that’s what makes this a beautiful place. Everyone can be an American.</text>
