    <title>I don't believe that women should have to mandatory join the draft. CMV</title>

    <original_post>I believe that men are better suited for fighting in the armed forces than women are. If America was ever in a situation and they used the draft the men should go to war and the women need to stay home and support the troops in other ways. Most women are too emotional for that sort of this and would think too much rather than react. 
Plus women get hormonal and might make poor decisions during certain times. Plus, they could potentially be a big distraction to the men on duty.
Women would obviously be able to still volunteer or enlist, but they should not be forced to join the draft.</original_post>

    <text>Women would care less about voting for a hawk that will reinstate the draft if they know only men will have to join the armed forces. there are many non-front lines roles in the army that could be filled by women, assuming they're not fit for the front lines.  </text>
