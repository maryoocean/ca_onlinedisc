    <title>CMV: Pride parades should have less NSFW content</title>
    <original_poster>punmaster29</original_poster>
    <original_post>To preface, I'm bisexual and I love pride month and pride parades. However, I think that the amount of inappropriate content impedes some of the intent behind pride. 

To me, pride is about celebrating the LGBT+ community and promoting acceptance and understanding. It's about not being ashamed of who we love and what we identify as, and being able to share that with the world. 

I think the parade would ideally be a great place to bring our families, to show parents and children how incredible and talented the community is. I'm not out to my family, but bringing them to Pride would be a great start towards warming them up to accept me. But generally given the amount of public nudity and sexual inappropriateness at Pride, this is pretty much out of the question. 

In order to be more inclusive and celebrate love with as many people as possible, I think pride parades should tone down the sexual undertones and focus more on the concepts of love, pride, celebration, and acceptance. </original_post>

    <text>Being gay myself i understand where you come from: oversexualization and overimplication of big corporations both hurt the policital aspect of Pride (that is, to normalize lgbtiaq folks)

However, being latinoamerican and living in a sexist city where it is still somehow taboo, Pride also counts as a 'liberation' factor: i have the excuse to be as oversexualized as i want to be, because that is my right as a person. Take it as a 'today idgaf about societal norms because all year round i'm criminalized, discriminated against, ridiculed.'

I can't comment on the implications of other comunities because i know little of it, but Pride can serve as both an organized political manifestation and a chaotic cathartic party. I think it's okay as long as it's kept civil. </text>
