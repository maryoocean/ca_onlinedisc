    <title>CMV: the clock in a soccer game should be stopped for stoppages, rather than adding stoppage time.</title>

    <original_post>I was having a sports-related discussion with my brother in law earlier today and we stumbled on this topic.  Neither of us are big soccer fans, but we both like sports in general. We both watch football (which has its own flaws) and baseball (which also has its flaws). I later found this article:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2014/06/12/stoppage-time-in-soccer-how-it-works-and-what-it-means/?noredirect=on

I still don’t understand why a referee in charge of timing can’t just stop the clock for things like injuries, goals, and such. My reasoning:

* Other timed sports have this mechanism. The clock stops in American football for various events. The clock stops in hockey for fouls and goals. The clock stops in basketball for fouls (and I believe after baskets later in the game, in some formats). 
* The clock not stopping and leaving it to the referee to determine stoppage length leads to time-wasting that is against the spirit of competition, even if it is not technically against the rules - think of the instances of a player knocking the ball away from an opponent about to throw the ball in, or continuing to dribble the ball away from opponents when it is not their possession. These tactics, along with the prevalence of flopping, IMO, are detrimental to gaining new fans, especially in America.
* Knowing exactly when a game (or period of play) ends is better than the referee deciding it in any semi-arbitrary manner. The article I linked mentions that referees are unlikely to blow the play dead in the middle of an attack. I think that this is bad practice. The clock runs out on American football teams in the middle of a drive all the time. Basketball players are forced to take an unlikely shot because the clock is running out and the ref isn’t going to let them just play out the whole possession after the clock hits zero.
* If guidelines and best practices exist as to when to add stoppage time, including stoppage time during stoppage time, why can’t rules exist regarding stopping the clock? Discretion is a dangerous thing, especially when being influenced by a home crowd. 

CMV, folks. I like sports. I’d like to appreciate soccer more, even if I don’t go out of my way to watch games outside the World Cup,

Edit: I’ve heard the argument about stoppages leading to commercials. I don’t buy that. Soccer stoppages aren’t generally long enough to squeeze in ads. There aren’t timeouts, the (terrible) concept of a TV timeout doesn’t exist like it does in basketball games, you’re not gonna cut away during a penalty kick (where the clock runs), and injuries suck but I don’t see any loss of value if you replace footage of a guy on the turf getting stretchered off with a commercial or two.</original_post>

    <text>Not so much a counter argument but a gripe, in American Football the clock barely starts. For 1 hour of game time you have 4 hours of elapsed time on average.

Its painful. 

Now take Rugby and Football and they are faster and more fluid. Yes, Italian footballers could be confused with Olympic Divers but in principle the game moves and is dynamic. 

To your point, when does a stoppage start and end? From when the ref signals  or to when the event happens? Its all pretty arbitrary and so long as one team (or ref) isnt taking the mick, roll with it.</text>

    <text>Oh, I agree about football. It’s a lot of fluff for so little action. That’s why I watch in the background while socializing or doing other stuff. I have a favorite team and such but I’m not blind to the game’s flaws (not saying that soccer fans, especially those who have argued here in good faith, are blind to their flaws).

Your question is a valid one and might be for more knowledgeable folks to decide. Based on my experience in other sports, I don’t see any immediate detriment to starting on action, and stopping on a whistle. Stop on fouls when the ref blows the whistle (allowing the ref to allow for continuation and such) and start when the ball is kicked for a free kick, or thrown for a throw-in. Maybe if you were concerned about pace of play, revoke possession of the players take too long to put the ball back in play (like the 5-second violation in basketball).</text>
