    <title>CMV: Saying you don't care about freedom of privacy because you have nothing to hide is like saying you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say.</title>

    <original_post>I've argued about this with a girlfriend a couple times now. I believe that the freedom of privacy is a kind of pillar of American freedom, along with life, expression, etc. If we do not have privacy we have lost among our most basic of rights. Her argument is that it doesn't matter if we've lost them, because the government (see: any vested interest with control in mind) will just spy in you anyway, even after they've been caught (see: Snowden) because they can always find ways to do it without people knowing. My rebuttal is that the battle isn't over until you say it's over, quite literally in this case, because their only threat is us, the people who do want a right to privacy.

I use the free speech comparison because similar things happen when the rights are infringed upon. If your freedom of speech is taken away, you no longer have the ability to voice opposition. This would result in anybody who is for free speech will be impossible to find. It's somewhat similar to what happens today with social media hugboxes, the opposition gets harder and harder to find, sounds more and more crazy with each day. It's pretty obvious where this leads. I compare this to right to privacy because too much surveillance means somebody is more hesitant to do natural things, like criticize those in power. Especially when your country is like the USA which has a long history with torture, but that's another story. 

The point is, I understand that the idea that we have privacy in this age is laughable, but that very idea is exactly why you can't just roll over for it. It's a constant battle that must be fought; it's somewhat unfortunate that it's that way, but always revel in the fact that those rights even exist in your mind because without them, you'd have no idea what you're missing out on.

Feel free to ignore the rambling and just try to sway me. I am open to thoughts and opinions on this topic, embrace the ability to even have this discussion.

    <text>Just want to chime in that I like your comparison.  My guy doesn't value "freedom of privacy" either and I haven't been able to articulate exactly why I think it's important but I'll try comparing it to freedom of speech and see what he says.</text>

    <text>Yeah, I think this is a really good way to think about the situation, and it really helped me evaluate the situation when Edward Snowden used the comparison in one of his [AMAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36ru89/just_days_left_to_kill_mass_surveillance_under/crglgh2?context=10000). I wrestle with what's the right answer here but I think I usually come down on the side of the right to privacy should be protected. Snowden's words help me usually get there.

However, I do want to warn that I've used the argument on others and they generally still haven't cared. One friend even told me that he'd be okay losing his right to free speech too. It was a bit discouraging so I'd just say make sure your SO is open-minded and try to be sure you can relate the two as fundamental rights.</text>
