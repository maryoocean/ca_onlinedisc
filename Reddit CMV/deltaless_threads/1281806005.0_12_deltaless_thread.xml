    <title>CMV: While the GME squeeze is a powerful display of retail trader’s power, there is no endgame that doesn’t result in them losing massive amount of money.</title>

    <original_post>The GameStop squeeze carried out by r/wsb and others demonstrated the power of retail traders and seems like a fair punishment on market makers and hedge funds that have taken advantage of the stock market for ages, but there is no way that it will end well for them. Sure, a lot of stock brokers have lost millions on shorts because retail traders refuse to sell and are still buying, but they can afford to do so because they have enormous amounts of cash to rest on and because GME is clearly overvalued. GME’s market cap is several times its revenue, and the only reason it is that high is because of the artificial demand created by internet communities. At some point, sellers are going to fold and GME is going to collapse, and everybody that purchased it when it was overvalued is going to lose massive amounts of money, while Wall Street short sellers laugh their way to the bank.</original_post>

    <text>While I wouldn't go so far as to call it a pump and dump scheme since I honestly believe that the people who started it had the best intentions in mind...the reality is that some of the retail traders that bought Gamestop stock will become richer. Waaaaaaaaay richer.

While others will lose the money they invested.

From Wikipedia:

*"Pump and dump" is a form of securities fraud that involves artificially inflating the price of an owned stock through false and misleading positive statements, in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price.*

It is likely that some important and influential people in *that* subreddit are overhyping the Gamestop stock and telling others to hold the line and don't sell because it is in their best interest to keep driving the price to the peak AND then sell it when it is at the highest.

So you're wrong in saying that

&amp;gt;At some point, sellers are going to fold and GME is going to collapse, and everybody that purchased it when it was overvalued is going to lose massive amounts of money, while Wall Street short sellers laugh their way to the bank.

Because not *everybody* that bought it late into the game is going to lose massive amounts of money. Even if you bought stock yesterday when it was at 400 USD you can still make money if you're among the first ones to fold when/if it reaches a peak.

So yes, some will win and will lose, that's the name of the game. But not *everybody* will lose.</text>

    <text>You nailed it. I’m pretty much assuming that anyone posting “HOLD TIL 1000” has sell orders at 999 or below.</text>

    <text>Definitely. It amazes me how some people in that sub haven't caught on to it: those who sell first will profit immensely will those who sell last will lose their initial investment.  

Someone who bought 100 stocks while it was at 20 USD and sold them while it was 400 USD made a 38000 USD profit (40000 -2000 =38 000). 

Sure, that seems pocket change to many but imagine those who bought 10,000 stocks while it was at 20 USD and sold them while it was at 400 USD. That's a 3.800 million USD profit.</text>
