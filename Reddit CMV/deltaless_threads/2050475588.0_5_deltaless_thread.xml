    <title>CMV: The only difference between AI (digital) life and human (physical) life is the material which sustains it</title>
    <original_poster>CarpeBedlam</original_poster>
    <original_post>To be clear, I’m talking about a theoretical AI which is designed specifically to be indistinguishable from a human, and accomplishes that goal. Also, I don’t necessarily mean an android that is physically equivalent (e.g. Ash from “Alien”), but just a digital consciousness living in a computer which is capable of replicating human behavior. At that point, I’m struggling to find a difference between the two that isn’t solely about the material required to sustain the life (blood, tissue, etc. for human life, silicon, copper, etc. for AI life).</original_post>

    <text>Theres also going to be differences in the processing the world and knowledge.

A simple example is that current computers process input serially but extrememly fast, while humans process slower by comparison but can process multiple streams of information simultaneously.</text>

    <text>That’s true. Good point. Different topic, but that makes me wonder about the manner in which people with autism sometimes process the world, or specific elements of it.</text>
