    <title>CMV : advertisements, data mining and targeted marketing isn’t unethical</title>
    <original_poster>The_IOvOI</original_poster>
    <original_post>With all these posts on the front page and comments on the measures people undergo to avoid targeted advertisements and data mining I was curious as to why there is such a strong opposition to this. The way I’ve always seen it is that google / amazon etc are providing a service, and instead of paying 20 cents every google search you let google use your data so that they can be profitable. I’m curious as to why people seem so against this as opposed to paying every time to use the service. 

Also as a sidenote, aren’t targeted advertisements a good thing? Instead of being shown silly ads that don’t do anything good for you your getting things that are actually relevant towards your interests. </original_post>

    <text>People don't have a problem inherently with targeted ads. They are uncomfortable with a massive private corporation knowing tons of things about them and being able to use that data to influence them and the wider public. Having ads targeted to you only reminds you that they're doing that.</text>
