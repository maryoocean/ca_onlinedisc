    <original_post>1. Although some disabilities aren't hereditary, almost all disabilities and mental issues come from genetics and genetic issues. 

2. I only believe this for people who'd be a complete drain on society. Yes, there are exceptions like Stephen Hawking and what not, but that's exactly what they are. Exceptions. I believe there should be no debate over those who're mentally insane as well. 

3. I believe the government should force this because the parents wouldn't know right from wrong while being distraught by emotions. Ultimately, it would benefit the parents much more to abort the disabled child. Have you seen how much of a life-ruiner those disabled kids are? 

4. They also cause anxiety in the parents because of the thoughts of what will happen after they're not around. 

5. It may seem inhumane now, but keep in mind that I'm talking about abortion here. The disabled currently alive can live their lives and what not, I'm talking about those that aren't born yet. Right when the doctors find out that the kid will turn out fucked up, they should do something about it.

6. Okay, okay. So you're morally higher than me. I'm a monster for thinking this way. **Can you honestly look me in the eyes and tell me that the lives of those parents of fucked up kids wouldn't be much, much better without all that bullshit? How many parents are having their money and time drained because of this stuff?** </original_post>

    <text>It will be incredibly hard to cause governments to do this. Our culture must change radically before this is implemented. Do you think it's plausible that the US government is going to do what you suggest in the coming 10 years? Twenty? 

I agree that your goal is right. But if you agree that it's implausible that our governments will follow your ideals in the foreseeable future, wouldn't it be better to wait for [designer babies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designer_babies)? Many people will voluntarily erase bad genes and make their children 'genetically perfect' if technology enables us to do this. </text>
