    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

Using a continent name as the your nationality is arming other countries and their inhabitants in a mieaningful way. And is a typical USA "we are the most important" way of behaving.</text>

    <text>That's the thing. Apart from Spanish/Portuguese speaking countries and France I think, much of the world divides it into two continents: North America and South America. So there isn't any issue with calling people from the US American because there is no confusion like in spanish/portuguese in the first place.</text>
