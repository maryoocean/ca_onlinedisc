    <title>Street Smart and Book Smart are two different types of intelligence. CMV.</title>
    <original_poster>frog_dog_outlaw</original_poster>
    <original_post>For the term "smart" I am referring to the combination of *knowledge - knowing something with familiarity gained through experience* and *intelligence - the ability to apply why you have learned*. (my own interpretations of the definitions) To me book smart refers to academic achievements and success or how well you did in school etc. Street smart is almost instinctive; its more than just common sense, it is being able to adapt and change with your environment. I am not saying you can't have both, but they are two different measures of intellect. Change my view.</original_post>

    <text>This is an interesting statement.  I don't actually think there is a functional difference in the MECHANICS behind street smarts and book smarts.  I used to though.

The main reason I changed my mind is because I have a close friend who is UNDENIABLY more "street smart" than me, but because he didn't have a strong background in school, he tended to come off as "dumb."  The thing is, his "street smarts" represented REAL learning, only with a different set of teachers.  Much of his "educational background" came from helping his mentor operate a business, and there's PLENTY to be learned when running a business. 

He's proven to be VERY able to learn and advance in incredibly complicated "book smarts" subjects when I've worked with him on them.  Sometimes I have to give primers and asides to connect the dots; he understands most problems EASILY from a "top down" high level abstraction perspective, but he's slower at a "bottom up" low level abstraction perspective.  This represents his lack of a general education but readily illustrates his ability to capture additional knowledge and skills when presented from the proper angle.

Additionally, I can leverage the things he learned during his street days to advance him more quickly; any time I can make a comparison to the knowledge he already HAS access to in his mind, he learns at an accelerated rate.

I now honestly believe he is a peer on equal footing with regards to intellectual capability.  And I consider myself QUITE brainy.

The only real pitfalls are when he has been taught/assumed facts that are indeed NOT facts.  This is the hardest type of knowledge to undo; when you "know" something already it's very difficult to un-know it. It takes repeated efforts to correct misinformation but when I apply the same rigor to my own knowledge I realize it's quite difficult for me as well.

Edit: Removing my still-obvious bias (Changed "intelligence" to "book smarts" in the first paragraph.  Evidently they are still in parity in my mind, probably due to the 80's educational temperament.)</text>
