    <title>CMV: Free markets vs. planned economies and democracy vs. authoritarianism both teach us the lesson that centralization of power/control is inefficient and a bad idea. Therefore, the means of production should be democratically controlled and resource management should be done via market principles.</title>

    <original_post>I'm leaning towards market socialism lately.

On the one hand, we know that planned economies don't work. Markets seem superior in every way for resource management, because they are decentralizing. 

On the other hand, democracies teach us the same lesson. All the various types seem to have been more successful than monarchies or dictatorships.

So democracy seems to be the most effective and successful way of governance and control over particular things that require control and definite decisions, also because they are decentralizing.

The two ideas are perfectly compatible, and they both teach us we are better off distributing the responsibility and power over everything.

The most basic idea behind socialism is that the "means of production", the things people need to live, should be democratically controlled. This seems very reasonable. 

Private property for profit is exactly the same process as an authoritarian planned economy trying to consolidate more power towards itself. It's self-serving and inefficient. 

Why would it be any better than democratic control by representatives elected by the community, just because "its private property"? This is dogmatic. 

To me, this is a basic contradiction and a violation of the same pro-market principles used to justify it. 

All the motivations for innovation and efficiency are there in democratic control. 

Nothing changed except the notion of "profit", which in this broader scope plays the same role as "political power" in authoritarian regimes.</original_post>

    <text>Can we please define the terms?

What does "democratic" (my definition would be "ruled by the power of majority/plurality vote"), "authoritarian" (my definition would be "ruled in accord with the wishes of powerful few"), "market economy" (my definition would be "economy where the producers are free to produce and sell any goods/services on the market, and consumers are free to buy any") and "planned economy" (to me, it's "the economy where the producers have to produce the goods/services dictated by an outside entity") mean?

If you agree with my definitions, your definition of "democratic economy" is a subset of "planned economy", because a democratic wish of the people would be dictating what gets produced.

A "market economy" would then be synomous to a "libertarian economy", where libertarian means "actions of every player in the market are not influenced by forces foreign to the market", like a government.

Most modern economies work as "mixed economies", which means "producers and consumers have to abide by the rules set by an outside entity, but these rules leave room for free choices". Absolutely free market economies are a model and don't exist in real life (they don't include multiple factors such as nature, non-monetary factors in the market and similar).

Planned economies, the one you propose if my definitions are correct included, have been shown to be very slow to adapt to a changing market (for example, a vote on the launch of an iPhone would likely fail in 2008).

The modern economies, the ones where people are free to own resources and make business decisions within the legal framework, are not that far from the definition of "market economy" I proposed, and they have shown to be better at adapting to the market than the planned economies are.</text>
