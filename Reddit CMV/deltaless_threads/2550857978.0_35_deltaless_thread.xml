    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>They way I see it is this

If a bad cop is abusing their authority and a good cop let's it happen then they are not a good cop. Idc if they never harass anyone personally.

Also

It's been shown time and time again that when good cops stop the bad cops from misbehaving the actual good cops get punished, harassed, pushed off the force or worse.

Until we can have cops stop their coworkers from misbehaving without consequence then there is no such thing as a good cop</text>

How do you define letting it happen as I've seen ACAB people who would call otherwise-good-cops bad cops for e.g. someone else stopping a bad cop's abuse first so they didn't or being somewhere else at the time abuse happens. I've even seen people implicitly ignore that jurisdiction exists and say a otherwise-supposedly-good cop in LA is at fault for letting a bad cop in NYC abuse their authority</text>
