    <title>CMV: I'm wasting my time and money by going on vacation overseas.</title>
    <original_poster>beq451991</original_poster>
    <original_post>I am a somewhat recent college graduate and am about to take my first trip overseas, to Italy. I have a full-time job and am taking two weeks off for this trip. Now that the trip is coming up in a couple weeks, I am wondering why I thought it would be a good idea. I don't like the idea of two weeks of not being able to workout in a gym, eating decadent food, and spending as much money as I am on the trip. I am the stereotypical American who actually likes working and I try to work more hours than other people, punishing myself in the gym (if I'm not sore after lifting weights or out of breath after cardio, it's not a workout), and eating simple foods. I am going on this trip mainly for the historical aspect, but I am afraid of living too softly and enjoying myself too much, as ridiculous as that sounds. People tell me I'm going to work myself to an early death, but I see working as my purpose in life, as a man. I don't care if I drop dead from a heart attack at 40 if I worked as hard as I could and accomplished as much as possible.</original_post>

    <text>You might be missing an opportunity to gain a critical insight that could vastly improve the quality of the personal and business interactions that you will experience in your life. 

So much of what we take for granted as "the way it is"  is actually cultural construct.  In order to appreciate the depth of penetration of culture into your worldview,  it is almost imperative to spend time in other cultures,  to understand how their worldview fundamentally differs from yours... This gives you a clue to the cultural rather than factual basis of your views. 

This,  in turn,  gives you the tools to better understand and empathize with people from differing cultures,  and to question certain aspects of your own culture. This gives you agency in your actions and decisions that you simply would not have had if you were not aware that these actions were based on cultural assumptions rather than basic reality. </text>
