    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>I always thought the people claiming to be Americans because they were from a country in the Americas to be a little extra. It’d be like a person from Germany saying “I’m European” or a person from China saying “I’m Asian”. 

It’s not particularly descriptive considering the number of different countries in your continent and if people don’t know what continent you are from after you name the country that their problem. 

And if an Argentinian dude tells somebody they are American, people are gonna assume they mean the country</text>
