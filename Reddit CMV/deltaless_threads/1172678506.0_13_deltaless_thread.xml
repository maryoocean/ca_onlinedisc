    <title>CMV: Human Life has no innate worth due to the Laws of Supply and Demand</title>

    <original_post>Please put the torches away and stick with me for just a moment; I'm not a monster, I swear!

&amp;amp;nbsp;

So first I'd like to define the difference between Human Life and a Human Being. My premise rests on defining the two separately. Let me assure you that I feel that a Human Being with a developed consciousness is irreplaceable. However, due to the recent surge in discussions on abortion, I've been hammering out the details on a premise I'd like to present here in an effort to determine any flaws in it: **Human Life has no innate value, as there are over 7 billion humans on this planet, and the Laws of Supply and Demand dictate that an unborn child therefore only holds subjective worth.**


I noticed that many people seem to innately assume that unborn children are a highly valuable commodity, which confuses me, as any of 2-4 billion women could essentially produce billions more embryos at any given time. While a specific embryo or fetus can absolutely hold subjective value to a person, which is why I support laws that punish the murder of a pregnant person as though it was a double homicide, I don't see the issue with a person choosing to rid themselves of an unwanted pregnancy; nothing of inherent or subjective value was lost. While I'm not a fan of abortions used as matter of convenience (I'd much prefer universal healthcare and a robust Sex Ed curriculum), I see an abortion as nothing more than a medical procedure with no morality involved any more than a kidney transplant is "moral."

    <text>A high supply does not mean each unit is worthless. If the equilibrium exists at both a high supply point and a high demand point, that's perfectly fine from every angle

Think about a terabyte (1 TB) of memory. We currently have more terabytes of data in use than people that have ever existed, many times over

Imagine how much different your life would be if 1 TB of info from your phone and your computer suddenly disappeared? Wouldn't your life change significantly?

There are many TB's of data, but the TB's of your data are important to you. And my TB's of data mean something to me</text>

    <text>Yes, but what if you suddenly find an extra TB of space taken up on your computer that you didn't want; even if it had the potential to become useful, would it be wrong to delete it?</text>

    <text>Oh I’m not talking about a blank terabyte. I’m referring to a terabyte in use- storing photos, videos you’ve taken, etc. If the terabyte is deleted, they’re all gone forever. A blank terabyte won’t bring them back</text>
