    <original_post>I think all governments should be based on individual liberty and democracy. And statism, monarchy, autocracy, and dictatorships are ALWAYS bad.

I'm not going to elaborate on exactly why I think so, at least not here, I just want you to argue why I'm wrong.</original_post>

    <text>I suggest you read Hobbes' *Leviathan*.  It's a sustained argument for a supreme state authority that is not necessarily democratic.  It's grounded in a social contract, yes, but every state institutions is designed from the top down with supreme sovereign authority.

The view is compatible with most of the institutions that people enjoy in western liberal countries.  What it's lacking, though, is a constitutional right to representative government.  :)</text>
