    <title>CMV: Public transportation should run 24/7.</title>
    <original_poster>Keep-reefer-illegal</original_poster>
    <original_post>We live in a world that is no longer 9-5. Businesses stay open later, friends can reach us with a portable device simply by typing on a mini keyboard. It doesn't make sense that public transportation isn't 24/7. Here are some reasons why it should be 24/7:

1. Very few buses run at 2 am for last call, I feel like if nothing else, running buses later let's responsible drunk people take public transit instead of driving home. 

2. It would benefit the working poor who may work night shift 

3. As mentioned before our world is now 24/7 

Those are my arguments. 

I encourage you all to change my view 

Edit: by transit I am including trains, buses, all forms of public transportation, not just buses.

    <text>In a past life I worked gathering data for a transit system for a city of a million people. We used to have to monitor usage during the whole service day (Started at 3:30 am and ended just after 2:00 am). From approximately 8:00 pm until about 5:00 am almost no one used transit, it was available but almost no one used it. There needs to be maintenance done a train lines so they need to be taken off line periodically. It is easier to do work at 2:00 am when almost no one would be affected. 

Now for the operators, working 24/7 only increases the risk which increases the amount they expect to be compensated. This increase in compensation increase the cost for running the service which in term is passed along to the rider. So if you run public transit 24/7 you end up cost the working poor more to use the system which only further burdens them. The next time you are in a major centre at 2:00 am take a long hard look at how many businesses are open and compare it to the amount of public transit available. I think you will find that they are more or less proportional. </text>
