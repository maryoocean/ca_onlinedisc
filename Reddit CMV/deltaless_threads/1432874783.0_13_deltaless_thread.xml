    <title>Cmv: Companies should not volantarily raise wages</title>
    <original_poster>omar1759</original_poster>
    <original_post>A company (specifically one that has many investors such as publicly traded companies, but also private ones) that is already able to recruit AND KEEP more than enough quality workers at a given wage should never decide to volantarily(meaning without being forced by market conditions that cause labor prices to go up naturally) raise wages solely on the basis of helping workers. This is because generally speaking a company's moral duty should be to maximize profit for it's shareholders and basically labor is an expense just like utilities and companies are supposed to minimize expenses to achieve this duty. 
This btw does not include small businesses where the only investor is the one owner of the business rather than a group of investors. 
In that case the owner would be free to raise wages as he wishes however unintelligent that may be. I still it is not a smart decision to raise wages significantly above the market rate in this situation if you are looking at the overall good. A small business with more profits can expand the business and hire more workers.
However in this post I am still trying to focus on businesses with many investors and how it is morally unacceptable for the board of directors or CEOs to decide to raise wages more than necessary to hire enough quality workers.

Edit: I just want to emphasize I'm talking about raisiwages when the current wages already help recruit more than enough high quality workers, because people are responding saying that paying workers enough helps them be more productive.. I already took that into account.. If you need 50 high quality workers and you can get them at $12 you should not raise wages to $15 if it won't make much of a difference in quality and if your only objective is to help workers financially or "provide a living wage"</original_post>

That is never the case because there is no line for "we have enough quality workers" since your workers could always be of better quality.

Regardless of your current pay, having higher pay will:

* Help retain workers longer.  Having low turnover can be very beneficial.
* Create more competition for new positions and attract higher quality candidates.
* Produce better company morale.
* Give employees the resources needed to deal with out of work distractions that might detract from their work.

Unless you're talking about something like a professional sports team which usually is the highest paying job that both job candidates and eventual job candidates could ever have, you're going to be able to attract better workers through higher pay.  Not only will you attract the best people in the companies profession, but it will also drive the highest quality people into your profession.  Take an incredibly bright and motivated student that is about to apply to Harvard and is picking a focus for their degree... pay is going to be a big part of what field that person's great potential ends up in.</text>

Up to a certain point yes raising wages will benefit the company, but if that point is hypothetically speaking only $12 the company shouldn't raise that wage solely for the sake of achieving a so called "living wage" for example</text>

    <text>Increasing salary *never* does exactly 1 thing though.  It always does multiple things. And after that the reason you give for the salary increase is largely about messaging.  Telling both your customers and employees it is being done for reasons of living wage can benefit the company in many ways.</text>
