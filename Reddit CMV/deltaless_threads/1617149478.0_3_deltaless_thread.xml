    <title>CMV: Tone Policing is OK</title>

    <original_post>  

Just from the get go, I want to say that I am rather on the left as opposed to being on the right or liberal. What I am about to say, therefore, is targeted as people who lean left but it is applicable to anyone. 

I have a feeling a lot people are going to disagree but here me out on this one but, I don’t really subscribe to the received definition of tone policing. If we go to my favorite source, Wikipedia, we find this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_policing). If you don’t feel like reading the whole thing, check out this quote: 

*Tone policing has been described by one writer as "when someone (usually a privileged person) in a conversation or situation about oppression shifts the focus of the conversation from the oppression being discussed to the way it is being discussed. Tone policing prioritizes the comfort of the privileged person in the situation over the oppression of the disadvantaged person."*

This to me seems a rather narrow definition? Tone policing is a lot of things. The term “mansplaining” is policing the tone of arrogant and pompous men with privilege who try to talk down to people. When we use the word “mansplain” we are criticizing pretentious men for their condescending tone. A similar case is the use of the term “Karen”. What are Karens? They are women who demand things in an overly aggressive and entitled manner or tone, right? I think that there are few rational people that would argue that men should never try to explain things, or women should never raise valid concerns about customer service. The terms “mansplain” and “Karen” exist to police tone. 

What’s more, no one likes being tone policed. Mansplainers would never admit that they’re mansplaining, Karens would never admit that they are Karening. And it’s not hard to understand why. When we use these terms, we are changing the focus of what they are they are trying to say to how they are saying it. We are not listening to them. 

But I would argue that’s OK. Because no one wants to listen to something that is being said in a rude, condescending or confrontational tone. Not your partner, not your kids, not your parents, not your teachers, not your students, and certainly not your audience. Tone policing is OK. 

But there is a qualitative difference when tone policing is done by privileged people to marginalized people, right? 

Yes and no. I understand that not everyone has equal access to power and a lot of people have perfectly valid reasons to lose their temper when someone inadvertently insults them in a demeaning and dehumanizing manner. However, this does not change fundamental facts of human nature and human behavior. Think about it for a second. People who are insulting can be insulting in one of two ways, purposefully and inadvertently. Let’s look at inadvertently first. 

Imagine that someone, an African-American woman, is offended by a middle aged coworker who uses some horrifically outdated and tone deaf but ultimately innocuous phrase like, “forshizzle”. Yuck.

And this is infuriating. I get that. But what is the proper way to deal with this? To shout at the coworker? To berate and belittle them? What will that achieve? Most like fear and resentment about being publicly embarrassed about something that they did not intend to mean as offensive. That does not mean that we should let the offending coworker off the hook. But it does mean that we should be careful with our tone. Because if we don’t, we run the risk of alienating a lot of people who might otherwise be sympathetic. 

What about people who are intentionally offensive? What about racists, white supremacists, and alt-right trolls? Surely we can unleash our rage and fury on them, right? 

Wrong. And it’s not hard to understand why. Just think about it. If you are someone who finds themselves on the non-Trumpian side of American and world politics, I’m willing to bet you love watching videos of Karens throwing tantrums, or popular subreddits like r/insanepeoplefacebook or r/neckbeards or which are devoted to mocking privileged and entitled people. It’s funny to watch people lose their shit, isn’t it?

So, if you are someone deplores the rise of bigoted, intolerant, nativist politicians (like me), you’ll probably want to police your tone and the tone of your ostensible allies a bit *more*, rather than less. Throwing a tantrum, calling names, losing your cool is playing directly into the hands of your opponents. You are making yourself look ridiculous when you do that. You are making yourself look like them. 

But, one might say, it’s natural and healthy to express anger and frustration. Perhaps, in personal relationships, but not really in professional settings and certainly not in political ones. We are in for a bumpy decade and the last thing we need is to act as though losing one’s cool is a righteous political expression. Let’s work more on being measured, calm and ruthless in the pursuit of our goals. Contrapoints has a great video about this. [Check it out. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuN6GfUix7c) And change my view. I would love to hear from people who think that tone policing is a bad idea.</original_post>

    <text>This seems pretty straightforward. Like anything, the issue is whether the conversation is being had in good faith or bad faith. If tone policing is an effort to distract in bad faith, it’s problematic. Right?</text>

    <text>Sure. There’s another problematic rhetorical technique called [sealioning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealioning) where you ask a bunch of questions. Is there anything wrong with asking questions? Yes and no. 

Yes of your goal isn’t to get answers with an open intent of discovering the truth with your interlocutor. It’s exactly the same. The issue is when the approach is a technique used in bad faith. 

“Good faith” is the process of discourse where the goal is collaboratively discovering the truth. You can still argue but all your techniques are oriented towards understanding, clarity, no strawmaning, etc.</text>

    <text>I've heard of sealioning and, I have to admit, my opinion on it is pretty much the same as my opinion on tone policing.  I see how this can be perceived as obnoxious and I see how it can be used to troll people, however, I think that ultimately, asking questions if always OK.  And if you are passionate about your ideals you should abide questions, no matter what they are.  

TL;DR:  It never pays to lose your cool.</text>

    <text>Sealioning is by definition in bad faith / asking questions maliciously in order to troll.

Likewise, tone policing (as defined by google/wikipedia) is likewise also by definition a criticizing someone's tone in bad faith. For instance the first result on google:

&amp;gt;Tone policing is a diversionary tactic used when a person purposely turns away from the message behind another's argument in order to focus solely on the delivery of it.

However, you also stated in the OP that you don't agree with wikipedia's definition or these major definitions.

If you don't agree with the most widespread definition, we're not talking about the same topic.</text>

    <text>But what do you think about my definition.  And the definition that is implied by the very phrase, "tone policing" .</text>
    </comment>
  <comment id="38219357172.0" user="fox-mcleod" delta="False">
    <text>It’s the same as sealioning. It’s just yet another technique of bad faith and it deserves to be called out when used as such. 

I mean, what if I just started sealioning you right now? You’d eventually disengage. When you do, if someone accuses you of running away from the conversation what are you going to say? You’re going to point out my bad faith sealioning — exactly as someone should point out bad faith tone policing.</text>

    <text>I don't think so.  If a person asks increasingly ridiculous questions, you can just disengaged or say, "Ok, buddy, have fun with that?  I'm going to talk about what I'm going to talk about and...you, do you! Have fun!"

But if you accuse someone saying, "You're sealioning!" or "You're tone policing", I see it as essentially saying, "I will not engage with you because you have upset me or, my right to be upset supersedes your point!"  Which is just not an objectively functional response to a person's argument.

If their argument sucks, if they're questions are disingenuous...explain why!  Without losing your temper.  

Does that make sense?</text>

    <text>&amp;gt; Does that make sense?

Well, you didn’t really answer my question. What are you going to say to a third party who saw you disengage and accuses you of running away?

The reason you disengaged was because the question asking was in bad faith. There’s no reason they have to be “ridiculous” at all.</text>
