    <original_post>Homosexuality is not natural, and neither is heterosexuality

There is no such thing as attraction in other mammal species, just the male raping the female and reproducing. 

Attraction in humans is a social construct. It's a way to soothe people or to bond similar to how bonobos do it.

Because us humans have “the instinctive need to produce offspring,” the sheer fact that men want to have PiV sex with women just for fun or without wanting kids, proves it's not a natural attraction.

Plus, most women don't care about being penetrated. It doesn't feel good for us, clitoral stimulation is a need for most. PiV sex has no purpose outside of getting pregnant. Sexual relationships are not necessary at all.</original_post>

    <text>I think there are a lot of generalities in your post. You may be right that it's the orgasm most people chase,  but that's an entirely natural development (like dopamine rewards in the brain) and would count as a 'sexual' relationship. I'm in no position to really comment on women's preference of penetration versus basic simulation,  but as a gay man anal sex is definitely enjoyable. Humans are fairly unique in the way that intimacy and the rewards associated with it can go beyond the purely physical, but pair bonding is a fairly natural concept throughout the animal kingdom.  Although I would agree evolution doesn't care about satisfaction in the outcome and not every species is the same.</text>
