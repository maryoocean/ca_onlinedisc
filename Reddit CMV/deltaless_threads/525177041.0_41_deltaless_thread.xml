    <title>CMV: Pride parades should have less NSFW content</title>
    <original_poster>punmaster29</original_poster>
    <original_post>To preface, I'm bisexual and I love pride month and pride parades. However, I think that the amount of inappropriate content impedes some of the intent behind pride. 

To me, pride is about celebrating the LGBT+ community and promoting acceptance and understanding. It's about not being ashamed of who we love and what we identify as, and being able to share that with the world. 

I think the parade would ideally be a great place to bring our families, to show parents and children how incredible and talented the community is. I'm not out to my family, but bringing them to Pride would be a great start towards warming them up to accept me. But generally given the amount of public nudity and sexual inappropriateness at Pride, this is pretty much out of the question. 

In order to be more inclusive and celebrate love with as many people as possible, I think pride parades should tone down the sexual undertones and focus more on the concepts of love, pride, celebration, and acceptance. </original_post>

    <text>It's always bothered me too, like it should be about being proud of being LGBT+, and not about being proud about leather and spandex. I think the overly sexualised approach and copious amounts of nudity kind of cheapens what the parade is about. Also for any outsiders who perhaps are trying to accept the LGBT+ community and want to see them as just normal people, I can't help but feel the parade validates any opinions that LGBT+ is just a "depraved bunch of folks indulging in their kinks".

Though I also get the whole "being proud about who you are", and maybe it should be about extravagance and taking everything to 11 since so many individuals suffered the pain of loneliness and shame for so long. </text>
