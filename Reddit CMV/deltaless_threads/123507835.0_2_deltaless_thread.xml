    <title>CMV: There must be some conspiracy or governmental cover-up regarding this missing plane.</title>
    <original_poster>billingsley</original_poster>
    <original_post>There is no way a plane can go missing in the year 2014 without any official having any clue what happened to it. The globe is surveilled every second. I read my license plate from a Google maps view of my house. The NSA has the power to read every piece of digital communication we send... and yet a plane full of people with phones went missing. That cannot be. 
I just don't understand how a plane can go missing. If they get any information at all from the black box, won't that lead them right to it? If the NSA can read my texts and track my phone, can't someone track the phones of the people on the plane? There is 1000 ways for my government to spy on me. When the boston bomber went missing the swat team used heat seeking technology to find him hiding in a boat in someone's back yard. And somehow a $50 million plane disappeared into thin air. With no crash evidence... no nothing.

Something is up. Not sure what, but somebody is up to something. 
CMV?

You're right it is.  That's why they're searching satellite images to look for it.  

&amp;gt;If they get any information at all from the black box, won't that lead them right to it?

You can't get any information from a black box unless you find it and pull it up.  It pings for a while but you'll have to be close to hear it which is what they're trying to do.  

&amp;gt;If the NSA can read my texts and track my phone, can't someone track the phones of the people on the plane?

They're not satellite phones.  If you're over the ocean, nobody's got signal.  Tracking a phone requires sending or receiving data from that phone which can't be done without signal.  

&amp;gt;heat seeking technology

what good would that do?  

&amp;gt;disappeared into thin air.

more like body of water so massive you obviously fail to comprehend it.
