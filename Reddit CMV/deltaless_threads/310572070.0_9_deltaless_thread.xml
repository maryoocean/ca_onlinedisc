    <title>CMV: Every straight girl out there secretly wants to date a rich guy</title>
    <original_poster>windmill230</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let's be honest here. Some girls say that they have no desire to date rich guys as they are looking for true love but really they are just lying. And as for girls who don't pursue rich guys, they secretly want to do this and the only reason why they did not do this is because they know that rich guys are out of their league.

Some people say that money is not a priority but really it is. Who doesn't want a rich husband who treats you nicely? "Money cannot buy happiness" is just a myth propagated by not-so-well-off people with a sour grapes mindset. The truth is deep down, everyone values money and secretly desires to be rich. I don't believe it when a girl says that she has no particular desire to date rich guys.

    <text>I agree that not just every straight girl, but I'd go so far as to say every straight guy desires to date rich. This doesn't mean that they're not out to find true love.

I don't think there's anything wrong with wishing that the person you'll find true love with is also well off, but your post seems to imply that every girl who says they prioritize love over money is a liar, which I don't think is the case.</text>
