    <title>CMV: Religion is just Peer Pressure from Your Parents</title>
    <original_poster>siddharth_pillai</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't think most people believe in their religion. Nor do they believe in the gods they worship. They simply believe in whatever their parents believe. If you're a theist reading this, ask yourself whether you'd still follow your current religion if your parents were Islamic?

You can speculate yourself, don't you think its more likely that you would be Islamic too? If your parents were Hindus, wouldn't you be a Hindu? If your great grandparents were Sikhs wouldn't your parents and in turn you also be a Sikh?

It may not be true for all but its true for an overwhelming majority of people.

Edit: I'm getting some answers asking about people who convert or have non religious parents, my views don't apply to these people</original_post>

    <text>Can only speak for myself- I’m glad I grew up in a muslim family. Although growing up my family and I never rly practiced the religion, I’m an adult now and recently became interested in my faith again. I’m now a practicing muslim by choice and thanks to my past I have a lot of basic knowledge of Islam already. But yea, I do think some families peer pressure their kids and guilt them about religion growing up, I think because those parents have the wrong idea on how to teach it. They revolve everything around culture instead of religion for example.</text>
