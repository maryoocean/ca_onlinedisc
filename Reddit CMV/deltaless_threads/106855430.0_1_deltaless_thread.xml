    <title>CMV - I believe Detroit should be placed under martial law and their bonds seized through eminent domain</title>

    <original_post>Detroit is probably worse a place to live then Mogadishu. It is a failed city. There is no hope of recovery without outside intervention. The Insurrection Act provides for "The President may employ the armed forces, including the National Guard in Federal service, to-- restore public order and enforce the laws of the United States when, as a result of a...domestic violence has occurred to such an extent that the constituted authorities of the State or possession are incapable of maintaining public order.."
Detroit is obviously in such a state. Where police response times are close to an hour, there is no order. Detroit should be placed under martial law (at least Iraqis received better healthcare then Detroiters), and their bonds seized to provide breathing room.</original_post>

    <text>Without knowing the definition of "domestic violence", I can't say for sure, but I think that passage would only apply if the breakdown in law enforcement were caused by violence, rather than by mis-management by the local and state governments.

However, I also don't think that using martial law would actually solve the problems, even apart from the political and morale issues it would create. (There is also the problem that the army doesn't really have an excess of military policemen, and you're talking about using the army as community police, not smashing an open insurrection or even dealing with a guerrilla campaign.)</text>
