    <title>CMV: the way that conservatives have got in line behind Trump shows that they never really believed in anything in the first place, apart from belonging to a tribe and beating the other tribe.</title>

    <original_post>As things stand, Trump has already been chosen as a presidential candidate once and is massively in the lead to be chosen again. Yet he seems to go against traditional conservative values in so many respects. 

* Family values: he's a known adulterer, "grab 'em by the pussy" etc.
* Religion: clownishly ignorant about the Bible
* Managerial competence: ignorant of basic facts about world and US affairs
* Honest dealing: on his own admission he's exploited bankruptcy rules several times to get out of debts. And where are the tax returns?
* Promises kept: where's the money from Mexico for the wall? Where's the "beautiful" healthcare plan that we were promised?
* Decorum: I don't think I need to say much about this one. Belittling, name-calling, tantrums, the list goes on.
* Democracy: "if I lose then it was rigged". This is probably the biggest of them all. 

I understand that some conservatives have distanced themselves. But the majority of the GOP seems to be behind him. What explains this, except for wanting to feel like you're in the in-group, and wanting to own the stupid libs?</original_post>

    <text>Republicans v democrats.

Republicans want less government intervention and less taxes. They're both intertwined because more government intervention means it has to be funded, and that's through higher taxes.

As much as the republican House and Senates "care" about traditional family values, it's a facade. Or if it were, it's not their primary goals. Their goals is less government.

So how do you do that?

You elect a strong leader who's willing to bulldoze his way through and get the job done. Trump has shown that. They may not like his pussy grabbing technique, but if it gets a bill signed in the republicans favor, that's all that matters. Why? Because a signed bill/law is "permanent" whereas pussy grabbing is "temporary" (as in, only during Trump's lifetime) once he dies people will forget, but a bill is written in forever.</text>

    <text>I just do not believe at all that Republicans want “less government”. They want to legislate what teachers can do in classrooms, how parents care for their kids, how women make healthcare, pass laws to put up religious paraphernalia in schools, how LGBTQ people function in this world. They want more say in every little piece of someone’s life, public and private. 

They just want poor people to be poor in some other place. And old people to die without help. And poor kids to go hungry in schools. Because their ultimate goal is that their tax bill is lower of course, that’s just the necessary trade off.</text>
