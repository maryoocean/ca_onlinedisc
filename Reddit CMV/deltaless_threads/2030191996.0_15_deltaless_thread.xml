    <title>CMV: It's fair to compare carnists (people who eat meat) to nazis.</title>
    <original_poster>Arkenhiem651</original_poster>
    <original_post>1) Carnists think that animals are inferior; Nazis think that jews are inferior
2) Carnists put animals in camps; Nazis put jews in camps
3) Both jews and animals attempt to escape
4) Both are/were normalized. Anyone who goes against these beliefs were/are suppressed and treated as illogical/emotionally driven
5) Both are unnecessary 
6) Both are/were driven long distances and murdered
7) emotional detachment from the victims
8) Both are sentient
Alex Hershaft a holocaust survivor also used this comparison along with other vegan holocaust survivors.
"We're focusing on the victims rather than the cancer of oppression itself",[8] and that "I noted with horror the striking similarities between what the Nazis did to my family and my people, and what we do to animals we raise for food: the branding or tattooing of serial numbers to identify victims, the use of cattle cars to transport victims to their death, the crowded housing of victims in wood crates, the arbitrary designation of who lives and who dies — the Christian lives, the Jew dies; the dog lives, the pig dies."[6

Also Alex Hershshaft looks extremely young considering he's 88 and survived concentration camps. That's irrelevant but I thought it interesting enough to mention considering he claims it's due to his vegan diet.

Edit: I know I say Jews but this also applies to other victims of the concentration camps such as Slavic peoples, gays and communists</original_post>

    <text>1. jewish people are people not animals.
2. see number 1.

This is the crux of it.  If you believe killing animals is equivalent to killing people then there are LOTS of human tragedies that we can make this comparison to.  If you do not believe these are equivalent then the comparison is absurd.

One way to look at is  - if i could go back in time and kill one person would I kill hitler or the largest chicken farmer in the world?  I'd kill hitler.  If I could rescue one thing from a concentration camp would I rescue the would-be beef dinner in the form of a cow, or would a rescue a jewish child?  It's not a coin toss for me - i'd rescue the jewish child.

As for him looking young that anecdotal evidence can easily be responded to with all the people who eat meat who look young for their age.   My grandma died at 105 and claimed it was because she ate ice cream every day.  I'm not going to read much into either of these claims.</text>
