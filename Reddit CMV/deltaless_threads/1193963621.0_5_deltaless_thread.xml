    <title>CMV: Self hate is not something bad.</title>
    <original_poster>NasZ1</original_poster>
    <original_post>All the popular self help information points, that we must not hate ourself, and try to love ourself. However hating yourself is a part of you. And trying to stop hating yourself will only backfire. Self hate is just as important as self love, and you can't have one without the other. The problem with self hate is not the self hate itself, but the huge amount of energy we spend, trying not to hate ourselves. You don't need to stop hating yourself, but to accept that it is a part of you, and like all emotions it is there for a reason, and it has valuable knowledge.</original_post>

    <text>Self-criticism is different from self-hate?

Recognizing your flaws isn’t the same as hating yourself.</text>

    <text>I believe that denying your self-criticism, or feeling that you can't fix those flaws will lead to self-hate. Which will only lead to more hate, and wasted energy. Until you accept that you are the point you hate-yourself, then accept to self-criticise, see your flaws, accept what you can't change and decide if you want to change what you can.</text>

So you agree that self-criticism doesn’t have to lead to self-hate?</text>

    <text>I agree. But just because it doesn't have to, doesn't mean it wont. You can't control your emotions.</text>
