    <title>CMV: social media is ruining political debates/conversations</title>
    <original_poster>_Goldy82_</original_poster>
    <original_post>Social media is an outlet for a lot of people to talk, tell stories, share experiences and news, etc. 
The problem I have with social media and politics is the rumoring and free reign for many to twist details and frame stories to fit their viewpoints. I see some examples of this and will link to some when i find more. 
I am young (younger teen), so are my friends/people I follow. And for my age there are some really strong views on recent events that lean heavily one way or the other, and therefore i see only what this person feels is the absolute. 
The reason I say that debates are ruined by social media is because these stories that I see heavily lean in either direction and people become extremely biased to one side or another and it makes it hard for people to open up to the other side of the debate
The experiences I have on social could be much different than others and I would love to hear some opinions that change my mind on this matter.</original_post>

    <text>I think it's actually just highlighting the problem, social media has made the campaign much more visible and and basically showed how dated the conversation is. Perhaps social medias spotlight will improve as candidates will be held accountable for their claims.</text>

    <text>I agree, social media can be used in a reasonable way when speaking politics, but not everyone uses it appropriately. This makes it difficult to improve when you see all the issues and are rarely faced with a situation in which the social media causes candidates and such to change for the better.</text>
