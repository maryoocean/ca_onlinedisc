    <title>CMV: Democracy can be saved if the left learns to LIE better than the right</title>
    <original_poster>Preaddly</original_poster>
    <original_post>There are numerous challenges for which effective solutions are yet to be found. Individuals who hold the belief that a world without solutions is not acceptable may find themselves disillusioned by the lack of offerings of the left. Similarly, the right does not provide viable solutions, although it is inclined to fabricate false remedies that instill hope. While the left may easily disprove these proposed solutions, it often fails to provide alternative avenues, resulting in a sense of despair. 

For example, there is presently no established legal framework to enable individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds to accumulate sufficient wealth to secure financial independence. The right suggests curbing immigration to create job opportunities for Americans, but this solution is not feasible. However, the only alternative is enduring an arduous existence of living paycheck to paycheck for a staggering sixty-two years. 

Choosing not to address this issue isn't doing the left any favors. It's now to the point where right-wing charlatans are now waging war on democracy itself. They never would've been able to gain as much power as they have if not for the willingness to lie. 

Although the left may lack immediate solutions, there exists a cohort of opportunists ready to exploit this vulnerability. In order to inspire hope, the left must also be willing to present alternate narratives, even if they deviate from the truth. A demoralized population will be more prone to believing unfounded claims made by just about anyone, including the idea that democracy is ineffectual.</original_post>

    <text>I think you're fundamentally misunderstanding the way in which the right lies. The right doesn't primarily lie by offering fake solutions. Rather, the right lies by offering fake _problems_. Trans people in bathrooms is a fake problem. Voter fraud is a fake problem. The 2020 election being "stolen" is a fake problem. Rising violent crime rates in the US is a fake problem. Concern about violent undocumented immigrants is a fake problem. The Great Replacement is a fake problem. The Little Mermaid being black is a fake problem. The lie isn't in proposing "solutions" to the problems that wouldn't work, it's in framing these issues as serious problems in the first place.</text>

    <text>You're totally right. The left wouldn't tolerate the creation of fake problems when there are so many actual problems. The shine would wear off much faster. All it would take is one term for left-wing voters to realize they've been had.

    <text>Yeah, if the left needs to lie it should be in a more Leverage-esque way, y'know, frame solutions to their real problems as if they'd solve a right-wing fake problem or something</text>
