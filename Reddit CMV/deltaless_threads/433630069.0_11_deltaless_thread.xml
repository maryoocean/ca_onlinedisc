    <title>CMV: I should be able to sell my organs</title>
    <original_poster>stupidrobots</original_poster>
    <original_post>In short I should receive adequate compensation during life for use of my organs after my death.  The goal of this is to provide a financial incentive to increase the supply (and thus reduce cost) of organs required for transplant.  The benefits I see are as follows:

1) it gives the poor and disadvantaged a way to make money and get on their feet without requiring higher education or years of experience, relieving debts.

2) The financial incentive gives people reason to donate organs who might otherwise not.  This increases supply and drives down cost, and reduces time on waiting lists.  

3) A profitable program of organ collection would allow advertising for agencies that do this service and write up contracts, increasing the visibility of the needs of people who require organ transplants.

4) The argument that this creates a black market for organs is silly.  If someone wanted to kill you and take your organs, laws against it won't really help because now we're talking about maniacs.  

Furthermore my organs are my property, and I get to say what happens to my property during my lifetime and at the time of my death.  To deny this is to deny that individuals have the right to their own bodies.

    <text>I don't think you understand how this works.

1. You can't sell your organs unless you know when you're going to die and if that's the case and you're terminal they might not be worth much. 
2. In the majority of cases they aren't able to harvest a donors organs. So there's almost no point compensating donors. There's a few very specific situations where they can harvest organs so that's why they try to get as many people to become donors as possible.
3. Why would they suddenly pay you for something that millions are doing for free? On another note, organs would become far more expensive if you're suddenly paying every donor.
4. The target group, which are poor people who might benefit from the cash, have very low quality organs. Either from smoking or drinking to actual drugs and prescription medication. Not only that but lots of poor are over weight and don't have access to healthy food. 

Final thing I want to mention is that we're coming close to the age where we can grow organs in a lab. In the future the need for donors will dramatically decrease.</text>
