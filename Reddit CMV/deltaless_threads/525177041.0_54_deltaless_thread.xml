    <title>CMV: Pride parades should have less NSFW content</title>
    <original_poster>punmaster29</original_poster>
    <original_post>To preface, I'm bisexual and I love pride month and pride parades. However, I think that the amount of inappropriate content impedes some of the intent behind pride. 

To me, pride is about celebrating the LGBT+ community and promoting acceptance and understanding. It's about not being ashamed of who we love and what we identify as, and being able to share that with the world. 

I think the parade would ideally be a great place to bring our families, to show parents and children how incredible and talented the community is. I'm not out to my family, but bringing them to Pride would be a great start towards warming them up to accept me. But generally given the amount of public nudity and sexual inappropriateness at Pride, this is pretty much out of the question. 

In order to be more inclusive and celebrate love with as many people as possible, I think pride parades should tone down the sexual undertones and focus more on the concepts of love, pride, celebration, and acceptance. </original_post>

    <text>I think that part of the original reason for the parade was 'defiance'.

This defiance is heightened when being so openly sexual, hitting at the heart of what made people uncomfortable. It is this discomfort, when dialled up to 11, which then makes 'day to day' non-heterosexual people, activities and culture normalised for people who need it to be normalised to change their attitudes. 

Also, maintaining defiance is also necessary, as to reduce it would be to neuter the impact of the parade and would be to forget progress made and the progress that still needs to happen.</text>
