    <title>CMV: "Likes," "Reactions," and "Upvotes" should be removed from social media sites.</title>
    <original_poster>AmigoDelDiabla</original_poster>
    <original_post>These reactions, whether positive or negative, reduce online engagement to anonymous, binary interactions.  They lack nuance, insight, or accountability.  And they are *wildly* misinterpreted in that they don't convey degree.  A high quantity of likes, or dislikes, just means a number of people saw and reacted to a statement/post/comment, but not the degree to which they reacted.  Especially in the event of downvotes/dislikes, I too often see the OP react as if that conveys hate.  Nah, it usually just means people disagree with you.

And it goes without saying how positive reactions can distort the owner's perspective of how his or her work is received.</original_post>

    <text>I think most people are capable of understanding that "likes" or "upvotes" don't strictly define whether a post is good or not. And when people have more to say, they leave comments. Like, all the time. And those comments aren't particularly nuanced or insightful, and the commenters aren't held accountable either. Your issue seems to be more with the internet in general, or by extension, the average internet browser. Hardly a reason to remove those features.</text>

    <text>You may have a point about me having a problem with (some features) of the internet in general.  Well, specifically social media. But I think the anonymity and binary nature of likes/dislikes is a net disservice.</text>
