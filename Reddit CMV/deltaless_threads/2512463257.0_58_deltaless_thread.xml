    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>There is a difference betweena public secular institution *endorsing* a religion and *accommodating* one.

I think at this point you are NOT encouraging secularism. You are encouraging outright religious discrimination.

I would defer to the US Supreme Court case Tinker v Des Moines (yes I know youre talking about a Canadian province, this is more about the philosophy of the decision than the legal precedent).

The ultimate decision of that case was if a garment being worn was in no way diarupting any school activities, it is inherently against freedom to ban it. How does Jack wearing his cross necklace make it harder for others in the class to learn algebra? The answer is it doesnt, ao why ban something that disrupts literally no one?</text>
