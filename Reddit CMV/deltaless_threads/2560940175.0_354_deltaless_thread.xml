    <title>cmv: There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as an “American”</title>

    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>All the commenters saying "there is no other way to refer to America, it's the country's name". Just say you're from the States, or the United States. Or the USA.

It's PART of the name of the country. But the actual name is United States of America. Almost as if the country is not all of America. Wild.

Even if you're JUST referring to North America, with "America" Canada is also on there. 

People from the USA sometimes love to think everyone else in the world is out to get them while they continue to live their USA-centered lives; even when people from the other parts of America tell them "we're American too, it's not very descriptive" they think someone is just out to get them, FFS.</text>
