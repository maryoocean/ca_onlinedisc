    <title>CMV: The notion that the Democrats or Republicans "must" run Biden or Trump "because there are no other viable candidates" is ridiculous. There are thousands of people who would make better presidential candidates for 2024 than Biden or Trump.</title>

    <original_post>Every argument for Biden or Trump to run in 2024 boils down to some version of "status quo" or "inertia." We're told that the Ds and Rs have no choice but to run these super-old candidates because there's nobody else who could be suitable.

&amp;#x200B;

In a nation of 332,000,000 people, there are well over 100 million who are over the age of 35, American-born, and have resided in the United States for 14 years or more - in other words, are constitutionally eligible to run for president.

Out of those 100 million, surely at least half have a basic education, are mature, sensible, decent people, and have demonstrated solid character - and also be significantly younger than Trump or Biden.

Out of those 50 million, surely at least ten million would qualify as *highly* educated - the metrics of which can be tricky to figure out (is it a master's degree? or something else?) - but they would be significantly above average.

Out of those 10 million, surely at least one million would be quite exceptional - people who have substantially high IQ, have advanced quite far in life and a career - such as being a doctor, or having worked in public governmental service for decades, etc.

And out of those million, surely at least 10,000 would have the political know-how, the charisma, the political interest, maybe have spent significant time abroad in foreign countries or speak multiple languages, to be a suitable president.

In fact, even in Congress, state legislatures or governorships alone, there must be dozens of good, qualified, educated, experienced politicians who would be much younger than Trump or Biden, and who would make suitable presidential candidates. 

So, CMV on this one. I don't buy for one moment the notion that, in a nation of 332 million people, America somehow has no choice but to run Biden vs. Trump in 2024 because "we've got no one else who'd be a good candidate."  </original_post>

    <text>The parties are going to select the ones who have the highest chance to winning THIS TIME. If they had more long term thinking they might select candidates that are younger and have better policies which would attract voters in the long term. But will people actually vote for them. 

If there are 2 candidates: one says that they will create economic policies that will lead to slow, stable growth and another candidate saying that they will completely upend the status quo, bring revolutionary changes and make America the leading power in next few years, who do you think people will vote for?

Even if the second one is trying to bring policies that cannot happen in real life, people still get swayed. This leads to over promising unrealistic goals. 

Parties then have the choose the candidates that will say unachievable things most confidently. That's Trump. 

I feel there are 2 solutions:   
Voters start choosing candidates based on the impact and achievability of the promises instead of false promises. Very low chance of happening.   
Some kind of election overseeing independent branch of government makes sure that parties cannot make promises that can't be implemented "reasonably well" in real life. Easy to say but difficult to do right. But better of the two options IMO.</text>
