    <title>CMV: Celebrity AMAs are ruined by Victoria from Reddit</title>

    <original_post>**EDIT: [Please read this from the /r/IAmA  mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/30ea3g/mod_post_riama_misconceptions/)**

I have no problem with Victoria herself, just the concept of "Victoria from reddit is here helping me out".

To me the entire point of an AMA is having someone of note interact
with this unpredictable medium.  Ask Me **Anything**.  It's fun and interesting to see them negotiate the comments, with the potential for them to be reading the most bizarre and funny points of view, with strange interactions on lower voted comments as well as random replies to far reaching child-comments.

Victoria from Reddit turns the medium into yet another "send in your questions and we'll pick the best to ask this person who is so much better than you".  Instead of interacting directly with someone, there's a filter.  A filter who types the same way in every AMA, using *italics* and -laughs- and -umms- which completely takes away from it for me.

Here Victoria says that the Woody Harelson AMA would have turned out differently:  https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fgsv2/i_am_victoria_from_reddit_amaa/ck91rpw  Which shows that comments are being filtered.  That is what made AMAs so great, it's a celeb being talked to directly, and this is more often POSITIVE rather than that negative example.

In essence I think Victoria turns it into a basic interview with fan questions that has been done a million times before.  If a brand wants to promote via AMA, jump in and get dirty.   I don't even read AMAs anymore if it's got Victoria doing the typing.

If there's a better way of looking at this , please CMV, I want to enjoy AMAs again without the frustration.

Reason for view change:

I still dislike AMAs with Victoria, and am clearly not the only one.  This comes from Victoria creating a difference between the celebs and us average Joes.  Of course this isn't always the case.  As it turns out, Victoria will help anyone that fits in her schedule.  So in reality it is just some AMAs (Ludacris as a recent example) that may turn out far more interesting if they had to navigate the website themselves in exchange for publicity.

With a few people commenting with first hand experience, I've decided that because the benefits of Victoria are more heavily weighted by the majority, my post title view has been changed.  Even if I'm stuck hating the AMAs, Victoria doesn't "ruin" them.

Thanks for all the replies!

    <text>I feel like the best argument for Victoria-assisted AMAs is the AMAs that Victoria doesn't assist. Anyone that's over ~40 and/or that isn't employed in a tech field usually does a pretty awful job - [Warren G](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2p0yez/warren_g_regulators_mount_up/) was, IMO, the prime example of that. tl;dr if you missed it:

"Hey Warren G, what was it like recording with Nate Dogg"

"ther was indo and beutiful ladies everywhere"

"Hey Warren G, what was your favorite part of being a rapper?"

"indo and beutiful ladies everywear"

"Hey Warren G, how did you choose the tracks you wanted to rap over"

"i thought they were interesting"

It's not even a matter of making sure an AmA is good PR. How many souls would be crushed if somebody like Buzz Aldrin had come off looking *that fucking incompetent?* That isn't fun for anybody. I feel like that's more of Victoria's purpose than anything - instead of filtering questions and deciding what questions are asked, she makes sure the celebrity gives a quality answer.</text>

    <text>Does Warren G owe you detailed stories and answers? Why do you feel entitled to that? At least you know it's a personal answer from someone taking their time. It's not supposed to be a biography. </text>

    <text>I think that you're missing the point. Does he owe me anything? Of course not. But at the same time, I don't think anything is gained by having celebrities like him exposed as illiterate. It's not really fun for anybody that way. 

Also, I don't see how filtering his answer through Victoria would have made it less personal. His words would still have been used, the answers would probably have just been better. It's not like she answers the questions on celebrities' behalf.</text>

    <text>I think Victoria-assisted AMA's are fine and enjoyable. 

I don't think the topic here is mutually exclusive. I do think it's rather rude to dismiss Warren G as illiterate when he took his time to answer questions himself. </text>
