    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>As a European, I have never, and I repeat, NEVER hear of anyone having issues with this. It seems to me you just happened to stumble upon a bunch of idiots. The entire world (except the aforementioned idiots) refers to people from the U.S. as American.</text>

    <text>Because as somebody from the UK you get it…. You’re called Brit’s because being called a United Kingdom or saying you’re United Kingdom goes against the English language. We can’t say we’re United Statetians. 

Canadians prefer to be called Canadians and Mexicans prefer to be called Mexican. It’s always only South Americans we’ve getting their panties in a bunch about it. They want to identify with their continent and not their county like everybody else. No US American would care if they called themselves American but if we do then we’re the bad guys. It’s all so ironic. 

Maybe it’s because they don’t speak English well so they don’t know understand we have an easy alternative.</text>

    <text>I just don't understand why South Americans even want the label to begin with? Like if you're from Brazil, wouldn't you want to be referred to as Brazilian? You said that we are called Brits but I would go even further than that. I always have and always will call myself English first and foremost. British rarely and European only in debate. A national identity makes sense to me but a continental one just seems weird. Russian and Spanish people have sweet fuck all in common so why would they want to share a label ya know?</text>

    <text>100% agree. It’s just silly. The vibe I get is there’s some sort of annoyance they feel about being left out? Why they care so much to make such a fuss out of it is beyond me bc I promise if we didn’t call ourselves American we’d get even more negative attention for being “dumb” and “not doing it how everybody else does”

There’s no winning</text>
