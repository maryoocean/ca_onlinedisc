    <title>CMV: Rap Music Sucks</title>
    <original_poster>chronicallyfailed</original_poster>
    <original_post>So it may just be that all the rap I've listened too has been bad, but I really can't think of a rap song or a song featuring rapping that isn't just unlistenably bad. 

The lyrics, even when they're not breathtakingly sexist and homophobic, tend to be boring, unimaginative crap along the lines of "my penis is big and I do drugs" - not that I have anything against songs about penises and drugs, just the way it seems to be done in rap that I've heard is just boastful and repetetive.

Musically, I just hear incessant, grating melodies played over a shitty drumbeat while someone talks over the top of it. A lot of the time I don't really see how it qualifies as music.

Also, the amount of ridiculous, pretentious crap in the music videos just makes it hard for me to take them seriously at all.

But I don't really want to just dismiss rap music like that, so please explain to me how it's not shit, and examples of it not being shit would be nice too.

    <text>The fact that most people have to look to 90's rap and obscure youtube artists shows how low the genre has fallen since that time. Lupe and Kendrick are the exceptions, but that's two people to a whole genre. One could argue that there was as much crap back then too. But here's the difference: There was a decent balance of the bullshit and the quality. Now there is no balance. Back then you wouldn't have had to search high and low for good rap music, it was actually being played on the radio and advertised.

Rap sucks now and two people or a handful aren't really going to change that. Even Jay Z admitted that he'd rather rap about the bullshit and get paid than show off his skills by going back his Reasonable Doubt days and not make as much. A lot of mainstream rappers admit to that. OP, I recommend you listen to 90's rap music and stick to it because the rap music of these days sucks ass.</text>
