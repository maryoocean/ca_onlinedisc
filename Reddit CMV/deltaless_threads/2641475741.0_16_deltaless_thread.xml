    <title>cmv: American society is still transmisogynoir - and anyone who claims otherwise is still sympathetic to old colonial racist transphobic values.</title>
    <original_poster>Cahania</original_poster>
    <original_post>Today we live in a society which maintains that women get less of a say, white people run our institutions, and thought leaders like elon musk are deeming calling a cis person cis is a SLUR. normalising relations with these ROACHES is fundamentally racist, transphobic, anti feminist. A true transmisogynoir 4 course MEAL. if you asked the average person, they wouldnt be aware of these concepts - theyd be living along a normal life cause they DONT CARE. American society is transmisogynoir and the fact that people don't even know the terms like this is evidence enough that people don't care.</original_post>

    <text>The reason cis is debatably a slur is that it was forced onto those it applies to, as if you asked someone from a few years ago, or who didn't know about the whole trans thing what to call someone who wasn't trans, it's safe to say they'd answer something along the lines of "Uh, normal?". The term cis is a form of [retronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retronym) given to gender conforming people, many of whom don't like it.</text>
