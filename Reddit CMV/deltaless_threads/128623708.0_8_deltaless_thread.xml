    <title>CMV: I believe that, to vote, people should prove a degree of selflessness (shamelessly stolen from starship troopers)</title>
    <original_poster>incruente</original_poster>
    <original_post>I believe that democracy is the worst system of government we have...except all the others (another shameless theft of a quote). But, like all things, democracy should be tempered with wisdom. There are already requirements to vote; being an adult, being a citizen, not being a felon (in some cases). I think that, in order to vote, you should have to prove that you have the interests of society at least partly in mind. In the book starship troopers (which is on the recommended reading list for the navy....weird much?), you have to serve society in a real, tangible way in order to vote. In the book, it's referred to as "federal service". In real life, I think the Swiss have it (mostly) figured out: mandatory military service (but for men only, which is why I said "mostly"). But for those unwilling or unable to perform military service, perhaps other public service for, say, two years; work as a 911 operator, or even for public works. But have a job assigned to you and serve the people, to prove you're not totally selfish.

Thus, the voting body is made up of people who are provable capable of giving of themselves for others. No other rights or privileges would separate the voters from the nonvoters. 

As an added bonus, if we did mandatory military service, we could have an unbelievable state of military readiness in this country. Imagine if even 50 percent of all our people were armed and had combat training. The military would be massive, but could serve a lot of functions; municipal construction, disaster response, even things as mundane as sorting recycling. Believe me, the military already does a lot of mundane stuff. Imagine a country where everyone that chose to serve would be trained and equipped to serve their country, and every person that voted would have proven that they had the best interests of society at heart.

    <text>There are a few problems that arise from this, depending on whether or not people are paid for their service.

A. If people aren't paid, then people in the lower classes won't ever get a vote. It's simply not worth it or even economically possible for them to spend two years in unpaid service.

B. If they are paid, a large number of people will want to "serve". This poses two problems.

1. The government can't legitimately deny someone the opportunity to serve, since it's the only way people can eventually vote. There's a limit to how many 911 operators we need. Not to mention, people who couldn't get work anywhere else will just go for a service job.

2. If you're paid for your service, then it doesn't "filter out" the people who have no concern for the good of society, defeating the entire point of the system.</text>

    <text>I would want the people to be paid; it's proper for people to be paid for their work. And I'm sure we can find plenty of things for people to do; I'm sure you can think of a dozen projects in your own community that would benefit from a large application of manpower. Just because someone is paid for their job doesn't mean that money is their motivation; if money was enough of a motivation for people to join the military, we wouldn't have any manning problems.</text>

    <text>What difference does "paid community service" have rather than just getting a job? Both provide benefits to society, and in both cases the individual working gets a substantial reward for their work.

&amp;gt;Just because someone is paid for their job doesn't mean that money is their motivation

The whole point of your system is to make sure that people who vote are concerned about the good of society and not just themselves. There are a few people out there who don't have money as the primary motivation for doing their job. However, the vast majority of people do.</text>

    <text>The point, besides the benefit to society and benefits to society that you've already named, is to prove that a person has a degree of concern for society.

I agree that many people make money their primary motivation for their job; I think, though, that we can find a way to encourage alternatives.</text>

    <text>You're missing the point: Paid "service" doesn't show that a person has a degree of concern for society.</text>

    <text>I think it is a strong indicator, particularly if the costs of that service outweigh the benefits.</text>
