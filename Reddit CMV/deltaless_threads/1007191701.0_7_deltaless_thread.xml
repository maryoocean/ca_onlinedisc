    <title>CMV: The raising of the minimum wage and globalisation has led to a decrease or in my country's case, an almost annihilation, in your typical "American" or for me "Australian" manufacturing at home.</title>

    <original_post>First off, I'm not saying that minimum wage and globalisation are a bad thing, so don't say I'm a protectionist, because I'm not.

The raising of the minimum wage and the increase of globalisation has led to a decrease in manufacturing because companies have realised it's cheaper to pay a Chinese guy 20 bucks a day than here in Australia where you have to pay a person with the same skills 20 bucks an hour. For businesses, it's not economically sustainable, so I'm sick of people asking why our manufacturing has declined because the answer is rather obvious. Australia has had even greater raises in the minimum wage to the US (workers must be paid 11.58 AUD in the US, and here in Australia you must pay the worker 19.49 AUD) which is why you will see at least a remnant of the once great manufacturing industry in the US, while here it has almost completely disappeared. The only places that Western regions lead in manufacturing are typically highly specialised industries where the skills needed by the worker are more valuable than their brute labour force. In conclusion, the raising of the minimum wage and globalisation has led to an decrease in manufacturing because it is cheaper to manufacture overseas. We are simply not competitive to manufacture at home.</original_post>

    <text>OP a couple of examples I have worked on over here in Australia as a consultant, Aluminium manufacturing and oil refining.

These industries are dying out in australia because the infrastructure is just so old. It is not cost effective to keep running a 100 year old fuel refinery. It is not cost effective to replace it with the latest and greatest technological advancements. The same with aluminium manufacturing. Our plants are just way too old and cost way too much energy to run. Newer manufacturing plants in asia are using newer technologies and are therefore way more efficient and actually better for the environment in many instances.

The rate of minimum wage is just one issue. Capital investment is actually a huge factor.</text>
