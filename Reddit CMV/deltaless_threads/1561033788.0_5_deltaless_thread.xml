    <title>CMV: Pregnant women should be automatically registered to donate their afterbirths for stem cell research (with an opt-out option).</title>
    <original_poster>Ragdoll_Proletariat</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm a Catholic and my father received stem cell treatment a few years ago. It massively improved his quality of life. I learned shortly beforehand that a woman's afterbirth and its core blood contains a lot of stem cells which can be used, to the point that women can actually donate them. I think this should be made an automatic process because of the following reasons:

1. There's no religious debate about harming an embryo because the baby has already been born, meaning that Christian women could help move this forward.
2. Afterbirths normally go in the bin which is a waste of stem cells.
3. Most women don't know this is an option so wouldn't opt into it.

I believe this would hasten research opportunities and consequently medical developments.

I write this with the caveat that women who want to eat it/frame it/etc can opt out in the same way as with UK organ donation. I'm not a doctor of course so I'm wondering if there's anything I'm missing here. I'm interested in seeing people's thoughts on this.</original_post>

    <text>It is also possible to bank those stem cells from their cord blood for your child. My sister did this after each of her three deliveries.</text>

    <text>I've never heard of that. Is that something you'd have to pay for? We have the NHS and I've never heard of that being offered.</text>

    <text>Yes, one would pay a private service to bank the cord blood from your baby’s umbilical cord. [cord blood bank](https://www.cordblood.com)</text>

    <text>It’s an amazing option, but it is very expensive.</text>
