    <title>CMV: Life is meaningless, and there's no point to trying to prolong it as much as possible.</title>

    <original_post>Whatever we do, ultimately, has no meaning. In the grand scheme of things, we are but a tiny speck of dust on a meaningless planet.

That's why i say that trying to prolong life is absolutely useless. This includes tries to reanimate dying people, trying to find a special formula for immortality, and similar medical/engineering advances.

Instead of finding ways to prolong life, we could better spend resources to make the life we've got more pleasurable. This would be a much better way to spend our time and resources, by actively trying to become a better and happier society, where death is just part of the cycle, with no taboos attached to it.</original_post>

    <text>Thing is, life is much easier to enjoy if you are in good health, and most medical research is about trying to keep people in good health. Just so happens that if you are in good health you tend to live longer.

Do you have specific examples of things that are a waste of money in mind? I am not sure there is actually anyone researching a "formula for immortality" and I don't agree that improving resuscitation methods is a waste of money (especially when you think of young people who haven't had much time to enjoy the pleasures of life).</text>
