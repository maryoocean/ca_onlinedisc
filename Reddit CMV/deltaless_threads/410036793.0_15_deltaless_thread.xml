    <title>CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are not ethically superior to standard omnivorous diet</title>
    <original_poster>Kor03d</original_poster>
    <original_post>There is no point in becoming vegan or vegetarian in effort to save animals lives. Suffering or even death of a farm animal are no different to those of a tomato, even if it is harder to emotionally compassionate to the latter, as it is easier for us to relate to animal feelings. You can not exist without ending other creatures life for food, and animal lives are not more important than plants or fungi in that regard.

Please note that does not account for switching diet for own health reasons.

*EDIT: Yes, in my view I consider that plants can suffer even if they don't have the same mechanisms of perception animals do. Jellyfishes don't have a nervous system anywhere close to ours, yet it would still be unethical to cut one in pieces for amusement. Jellyfish would still perceive injury and its normal biological cycles would be hindered. Same goes for plants*

    <text>Even if you discount the suffering of animals entirely, eating less meat (and therefore also, zero meat) might still be ethically superior to eating meat.

There are economic and environmental costs associated with eating meat that are not shared by most aspects of a vegetarian diet. Meat is less efficient energy and so it is harder to produce, and the production of meat in mass quantities causes serious pollution, and the heavy use of antibodies in farming undermines the value of antibodies for *everyone* in the long term by promoting antibody-resistance. And those things might promote *human* suffering in the long term.

If you believe that it is more ethical to pollute less, to do things like 'reduce your carbon footprint', then it is generally more ethical to be vegetarian.

Not universally; almonds are pretty damn wasteful for instance, and you could theoretically eat a *small* amount of meat farmed responsibly to minimize your impact on the environment, and technically not be vegetarian. So some vegetarians will be more wasteful than some meat eaters. Nonetheless, on average vegetarianism will be a significant net plus.</text>
