    <title>CMV:It is unreasonable to hold black people to the same intellectual standards as the general population.</title>
    <original_poster>Sky-Jellyfish</original_poster>
    <original_post>[IQ is strongly correlated with school performance, years of education, and job performance.](http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/pdfFiles/IQ_Neisser2.pdf) IQ tests (along with other tests such as the SAT) consistently show African people to be less intelligent. 

["8. The bell curve for whites is centered
roughly around IQ 100; the bell curve for
American blacks roughly around 85;"](https://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997mainstream.pdf)

["The four data sets can be averaged to give an IQ of 68 as the best reading of the IQ in sub-Saharan Africa."](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289609001275)

If attending university or working in upper management in a business requires a high IQ (say one standard deviation above the average or 115) then we should accept that a smaller portion of black people are capable than the general population.

    <text>Do you believe that strong school performance is the result of high IQ? Or is it possible that the correlation works the other way: that strong performance in school causes ones IQ score to go up? 

If the latter is a possibility, than this correlation could be easily linked to poverty, rather than explicit racial differences.</text>

    <text>[Heritability estimates range
from 0.4 to 0.8 \(on a scale from 0 to l\), most
thereby indicating that genetics plays a bigger
role than does environment.](https://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997mainstream.pdf)

Also "19. there is no persuasive evidence that
the IQ bell curves for different racial-ethnic
groups are converging." from the same paper signed by 52 researchers, mostly psychologists.

Heritability of intelligence is a large area of research and according to the [American Psychological Association](http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/pdfFiles/IQ_Neisser2.pdf) heritability is .75 for late teens and young adults.</text>

    <text>Fair enough. I can believe that intelligence is generally heritable. But you're making a much larger leap and implying that the genes that govern intelligence also govern skin pigmentation. Do you have any evidence that supports that notion? 

It seems logical to me that a potential genius could still perform poorly on tests if deprived of the elements that allow that genius to flower. Genetics determines potential, but not whether or not someone achieves that potential. </text>

    <text>Why does the IQ of black people vary between the northern and southern regions of the US, and also nationally from the past to present? </text>

    <text>I'd like to add on to your point by pointing out that sub-Saharan Africa  has nearly 50% of its residents living on under $1.25 per day and nearly 70% on less than $2.00 per day. Millions of people here do not receive an education past primary school. This should be a huge indicator as to why OP's conclusion is very simplistic and fails to acknowledge surrounding circumstances.</text>
