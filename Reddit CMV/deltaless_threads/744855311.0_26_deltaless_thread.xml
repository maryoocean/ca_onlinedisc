    <title>CMV: r/childfree is a toxic sub</title>
    <original_poster>SosRashneer</original_poster>
    <original_post>childfree is toxic. The sub isn't about being childfree, its about hating children as a whole. When I see a post on childfree its always about someone hating on other peoples "Crotch goblins" or "little brats". Like sometimes the child will be doing nothing at all and they're like "ugh I hate the little fucker so much like keep your crotch goblins inside your own house."
And I never really see any thoughtful discussions going on there I always only see someone hating on some other peoples children. And when someone tries to defend the child they usually get banned or downvoted. And I understand the reasoning of a child being expensive as to not having one, but if you're complaining that they're selfish that's the parents job to fix, and annoying, that can also be fixed by the parent.</original_post>

    <text>/r/childfree is toxic towards children as much as /r/linuxmasterrace is toxic towards the windows operating system. 

I don't see its toxicity at all except for the playful aspect of bashing what both subreddits are "against".

Most people need a place to vent and be understood, and /r/childfree is just like this. 

The users that complain about it are exactly the people the users of childfree need to rant about, i.e. the "I don't get why people don't like children like I do, omg they are monsters" crowd.</text>
