    <title>CMV: "White trash" is an offensive slur, and should not be tolerated in society just as we do not tolerate other bigoted slurs.</title>
    <original_poster>JSmurfington</original_poster>
    <original_post>This has bothered me for a while. The term "white trash" or "trailer trash" fits all the criteria for being a slur which should not be widely acceptable for use. But I have heard the term dropped casually in conversation, and no one seems to treat it like the slur that it is.

It is a term that denigrates and stereotypes a group of people based on their race, appearance, and socioeconomic status. It is meant to be derogatory. This to me is the definition of a bigoted term.

I'm not arguing that the term has as much history behind it as other racial or bigoted slurs. But in our modern society, we should still abandon the term altogether.

    <text>White trash is much more an economic slur than racial one.

And whites don't really care about racial slurs sent in our direction. We also don't really care if the poor or uneducated are insulted. 

Words like nigger were used to perpetuate an idea that kept people in chains. What did any white based slur do? Nothing. </text>

    <text>So, wait, what if a white person does feel demeaned and belittled by being called white trash? Would you argue it's okay to call them that because it doesn't 'perpetuate an idea that they should be kept in chains?' Doesn't it perpetuate an idea that their race is relevant to the quality of their character? And isn't the idea that race is relevant to the quality of someone's character relevant to all people of all races? </text>
