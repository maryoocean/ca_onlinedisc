    <title>CMV: StubHub and other ticket resale sites should be illegal and considered scalping.</title>
    <original_poster>aikdaman</original_poster>
    <original_post>In the US, 38 states have laws allowing the reselling of event tickets as long as the sale does not take place at the event site. The other 12 states have varying degrees of regulation, including registration requirements and maximum markups.

Why do we allow this middle man corporation to exist as a loophole for scalping and legally marking tickets up to exorbitant amounts.

At the very least there should be rules and restrictions in place for maximum markups. I understand supply and demand but find it ridiculous that often the re-seller makes the most money per ticket involved in a sold out production for doing essentially nothing. Oh the American way...

    <text>So you have someone who has this ticket that costs $75 and they think it's worth $110 to them so they would attend, there is someone else who is a bigger fan and to them the ticket is worth $250. If person A gets $200 (which they prefer to the $110 ticket value) and person B gets the ticket for $200, (which they prefer to their $200) aren't they both better off?</text>
