    <title>CMV: Why isn't Wonder Woman sexist?</title>
    <original_poster>BottomOfTheNinth</original_poster>
    <original_post>Most of what I hear and see about Wonder Woman leads me to believe she's sexist. In the depictions I've seen of her she comes from a society that banished men, she seems to be surprised when men are good (and on the opposite side of things, surprised when women are evil) and generally can't go five minutes without calling men dicks because her dad was an asshole.

To clarify, this isn't some men's rights post. I don't care on some kind of personal level if she is or isn't sexist, I just kind of want it clarified for me because a lot of people say she isn't sexist - yet in the examples I've seen of her (the Justice League cartoon, the animated Wonder Woman film, the Flashpoint comic book series...) she pretty much just hates men in general. A lot of people have also told me that while Wonder Woman herself isn't sexist, the Amazons are, so I could kind of do with that being explained too.</original_post>

    <text>I'm not sure I understand the context in which you feel she's sexist. Like, do you think the writers are sexist themselves for having created her? Do you think she, as a character, is a sexist?

At any rate, I assume you know this for the most part, but Wonder Woman's backstory is that she grew up in a society with no men. And the society itself's backstory (forgive me, I'm not a comics aficionado and I'm only somewhat familiar with her) is that they were created in the wake of some terrible abuses from men in ancient Greece. So while we don't necessarily agree with their perspective, it's understandable if you appreciate it from a narrative framing standpoint.

Look at it from this angle--if she *is* sexist, then it's sexist in the same sense that any fictional character who was frozen thousands of years ago and then unearthed and forced to face the modern world might harbor a whole host of different prejudices common to their era.

Also (again I only really remember her from watching the cartoons as well, so someone correct me if I'm wrong) don't a lot of storylines that involve WW include elements where she'll deal with the Amazons, and they're always like, "Pshh, Diana, I can't believe you give men so much credit. They're terrible, don't you know that?" and WW has to struggle to try to prove to them that she's learned that's not as true as the Amazons believed? Arguably she's just another example of the character archetype of the "person forced out of their element who gradually comes to learn that their prejudices were unfounded".</text>

    <text>I was speaking in terms of character, yes. I'm inclined to agree with you in the sense that her people seem to be the sexist ones, but she has grown beyond the teachings of her upbringing. Most of the examples of her I've seen never really flesh that idea out though, besides from the Wonder Woman film - but even that only does it in the last five minutes or so.</text>

    <text>My impression has always been that Diana is not sexist per se, but was raised in an open and pragmatic society without any gender distinctions at all.  The "world of men" was to her as "Kyrgyzstan" is to the typical American: Foreign to the point of near-complete ignorance and incomprehensibility.  She was surrounded by Amazonian women who had perpetuated a generations-old speculative fiction about men in place of any actual experience.

Her reactions to men (and often women) in the "world of men" have included frustration and impatience with our impractical natures.  She sees our tendencies to avoid risk and accountability as a cowardly failure of personal responsibility, and she often equates sarcasm and euphemism with genuine dishonesty.

At the same time, she has found in the "world of men" individuals of both genders who exemplify the traits of honor and courage that the Amazonians value, often exceeding the paragons of her own society.  More than once, she has shown that she has not only learned the principles of humor and sarcasm, but in fact has a cutting wit of her own.  She soon returns to her Amazonian "persona", though, and her colleagues and rogues alike have found themselves taken off-guard by how thoroughly she understands their natures.  I would surmise, and this may have been revealed explicitly in the comics, that she intentionally maintains a facade of ignorance and intolerance toward some (non-gender-specific) traits of the "world of men" specifically because it draws out the best in those around her.</text>
