    <title>CMV: leave stray animals be, esspecially sick ones. death is not the end of the world</title>
    <original_poster>enshem</original_poster>
    <original_post>\*english is a second language to me.

animal shelters/activists tend to pick up stray animals in order to rescue them from the streets. they claim to save them from hunger, poor hygiene and loneliness. sometimes it will suffer from hurtful medical condition which is costly to treat.

animals feel pain but they are not humans in the sense that they do not have the same metaphysic needs, such as excelling at work, philantroping or refining there eloquent thoughts about doing better as a being...

i think it's safe to assume that their conception of death is more like ancient humans who were sad but not alianited by it, opposite to our society which hides its deaths in hospitals and bursts with grief for celebrities that undergo the most common thing there is. that's why i feel  saving as much (urban) animal lives as possible is pointless.

sometimes the animal has some medical condition, which means it'll die sooner. treating wilk be a waste of money and sometimes cause painful recovery process. if the animal suffers its best, i think, to put it down.

i see on social media a lot of people who ask for emergency money to support their adopted pets, often more then few,  whom they took out of will to help the animal. like family planning, i think taking an animal with no means to treat it is selfish and irresponsible, while the better option is leaving it in the ecosystem it originally came from.

i love animals and act by it - veganism, owning adopted dog, keeping beauty cruelty free. but i theorize that adopting because of the "animal needs" is actually more selfish, done by people who wants to feel good with themselves when actually doing more harm.

im totally for adopting and not buying, as long as you have the means to treat it. if a stray animal look like it's in major pain - if you can't afford a vet, human painkillers can get queted and brought out of context, or become the empathic solution in this situation.

thank you for reading this far,

looking forward to read your thoughts in return and broaden my point of view :)</original_post>

    <text>You're *mostly* right. 

&amp;gt;animals feel pain but they are not humans in the sense that they do not have the same metaphysic needs, such as excelling at work, philantroping or refining there eloquent thoughts about doing better as a being...

By '*animals*' you almost certainly mean '*cats*' and '*dogs*'. These (especially dogs) are social mammals and require social connections for happiness. But, yes, lacking a large neocortex like humans do (or some pilot whales perhaps, which have been found to have the most neocortical neurons) cats and dogs likely lack '*metaphysic*' (philosophical?) concerns.

In any case, I generally agree that the weird mania (mostly in the USA) to '*disappear*' all strays from the streets (which, all bullshit aside, basically means to kill them as few get '*adopted*'), constitutes a kind of fake '*benevolence*'.

The happiest-looking dogs and cats I've ever seen were strays living free in neighbourhoods, being befriended and fed by the neighbourhood community.

Anyway, another bizarre/barbaric practice (supposedly done for the animals' own good) is the spaying and castration (instead of tubal ligations and vasectomies) of all pets.

There may be no need to change *your* view much ... but there may, perhaps, be need to change *other* peoples' however. :)
