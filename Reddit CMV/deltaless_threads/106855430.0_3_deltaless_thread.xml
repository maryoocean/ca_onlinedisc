    <title>CMV - I believe Detroit should be placed under martial law and their bonds seized through eminent domain</title>

    <original_post>Detroit is probably worse a place to live then Mogadishu. It is a failed city. There is no hope of recovery without outside intervention. The Insurrection Act provides for "The President may employ the armed forces, including the National Guard in Federal service, to-- restore public order and enforce the laws of the United States when, as a result of a...domestic violence has occurred to such an extent that the constituted authorities of the State or possession are incapable of maintaining public order.."
Detroit is obviously in such a state. Where police response times are close to an hour, there is no order. Detroit should be placed under martial law (at least Iraqis received better healthcare then Detroiters), and their bonds seized to provide breathing room.</original_post>

    <text>People who don't like Detroit can move.  The citizens of Detroit have not called for martial law; if they wished to they could vote for it.

If cities are permitted to default on bonds, then it will become extremely difficult for other cities to borrow at reasonable rates.  Conversely, if the US government pays the lender instead of Detroit, it will encourage other cities to borrow far beyond what they can afford to repay.  It is only by requiring Detroit to take its economic medicine that we can maintain a healthy municipal bond market in the US.
