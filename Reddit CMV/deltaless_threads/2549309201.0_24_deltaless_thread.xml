    <title>CMV: The US Should Mandate all Fees/Expenses be Disclosed Up Front As Much As Possible</title>

    <original_post>I believe the United States should legally require ticket sellers like Ticketmaster to provide prices inclusive of all fees and surcharges when shopping for tickets.

Hidden fees distort the free market and make it harder for customers to fairly do price comparisons. These fees are deceptive and can often add up to 40% of the advertised price.

I’m tired of clicking on a $49 dollar ticket for a show to find out it’s really $70 when I go to checkout.  Or a $50/night hotel room having a mandatory $30/night “resort fee”

Similar policy should apply to things like hotel rooms, car rentals, phone bills and all sorts of other consumer purchased goods.

If a fee is variable (like shipping) or taxes, I could see that not being included in an advertised price if they can’t be reasonably determined at the time of advertising.  a TV commercial for a national brand, they could say “$499 + tax” since the tax is different everywhere.

However, for sales where the tax CAN be determined, it should be included in the price.  A hotel room should advertise the total price, since the tax calculation is based on where the hotel is, and can be reasonably determined at the time of advertising.

This greater price transparency would greatly benefit consumers.</original_post>

    <text>Good idea in theory. This is blatant false advertising and even the most staunch capitalist would oppose that. 

The sticky issue is writing actual effective legislation on the matter. If I order a burger and decide I want fries and a drink with that, does the following surcharge count as a hidden fee? What about if my mechanic spots an issue that wasn't obvious at the beginning? How much disclosure is enough? How do you differentiate between a fee and a legitimate upcharge? It's the details that tie this up, not the core concept. Because that's where snakes like to hide, in the weeds.</text>
