    <title>CMV: The nestle CEO video that is currently viral on reddit is not that damaging to nestle or the CEO.</title>

    <original_post>Now don't get me wrong you would want as an achievement for society, all humans to have access to clean water. Whether you see this as a human right is down to how you define rights, one way of looking at rights which I assume how the CEO looks at them is that human rights are natural to humans and can be only taken away by government decrees such as freedom of speech or freedom to express your religious beliefs. If you look at rights this way that means that no one has a right to a commodity which someone else owns. This doesn't mean that you support people not having water it just means that you don't give the green light for the government to start controlling the commodity as it could use human rights as a justification.

I think what this debate boils down to is whether or not water should be nationalised.

 I think privatised water with no government assured monopolies to any company is a more efficient way of doing things as market prices is a large factor in what determines how much of something is produced. Also it gives the consumers more choice, imagine if there was only one brand of government owned water that they put chemicals in like Dasani, you wouldn't want to drink that so you would hope that you would be able to buy another brand that meets your needs as a consumer.

Edit: As u/ytzi13 points out I mean that I personally don't see a problem with his statement rather than saying that people won't react badly.</original_post>

    <text>Water is a basic condition for life, for humans. 

The lack of a basic condition for living undermines these other rights that require it.

Freedom of speech or religion when you don't have water is worthless, because being dead would prevent free expression of both.

What's "Natural to humans" requires environmental conditions to actualize, so these must be folded into them, not abstracted from them as if they were separate and irrelevant concerns.

The "one way to look at it" is just a wrong way to look at it, and following logic shows this.

Ownership also has to be legitimate, otherwise it is no more than theft glorified by legalese. Societies that aren't managed by corrupt or stupid people consider some resources as belonging to a commons for good reason and water is among those things everyone needs and is not created by human labor in the first place yet is a precondition for labor as a precondition for life, so obstructing access to it via political corruption for the sake of private profits, is effectively reducing economic efficiency and harming the society as a whole.

Selling off the commons to private entities is a great way to ruin your society in the longer term, and is in no uncertain terms corrupt, so in turn politicians involved in allowing this or facilitating it should be considered corrupt as well. They are clearly not acting as public servants which is their job, but rather doing the opposite.

Hoarding resources you don't need to profit off others with no/minimal labor and not actually contributing to society but detracting from it via economic and political corruption, power of whatever form really - and especially essential resources - to the detriment of others is not legitimate and people are right to object to it. Especially since bottled water as a business model involves all kinds of externalities due to plastic waste. This is a form of violence, Nestle is effectively a domestic terrorist and should be treated as such. Whether or not it's technically legal doesn't matter when thieves begin influencing or even writing the laws via corruption.</text>
