    <title>I believe that if Washington can have the Redskins, I can have a team called the Black People. CMV</title>

    <original_post>I feel that many people would be offended if a city had a sports team that was called the [insert city] Black People, or even The Blacks, with their logo being a black man's head. However, people (for the most part) accept the fact that the Washington Redskins have all of those same elements, except with a Native American.

 I know that in the past, and perhaps even currently, there has been a movement to get these Native American team names changed, but as we know, mostly nothing has come of this. I feel like if I made a team whose mascot was a black man, that team would receive such outrage that it would never survive. But if the Redskins can exist, the Black People should also be able to exist. CMV.</original_post>

    <text>There was actually a very great article on ESPN about this topic recently.  Frankly, if you are not a Native American yourself, I don't think you have any right to say that it is offensive.

&amp;gt; And I definitely don't know how I'll tell the athletes at Wellpinit (Wash.) High School -- where the student body is 91.2 percent Native American -- that the "Redskins" name they wear proudly across their chests is insulting them. Because they have no idea. 

I suggest you read the whole thing, but the consensus amongst most Native American's seems to be that it is not offensive.

&amp;gt;Same story with the Red Mesa (Ariz.) High School Redskins. They wear the name with fierce pride. They absolutely don't see it as an insult. But what do they know? The student body is only 99.3 percent Native American.

    <text>I'm glad you posted this, I read it last week and I couldn't remember the source.  But yeah, I found the origins of the term 'redskin' to be pretty interesting.</text>

    <text>My experience with Aboriginals/Native Americans/Indians is that they're all so different and most of them don't really give a shit. They all have a preferred vernacular for reference to them, but they really couldn't bothered if someone uses the incorrect terminology around them. They have bigger things to worry about than a word or a football logo.
