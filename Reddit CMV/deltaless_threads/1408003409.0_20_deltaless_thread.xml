    <title>CMV: Average men do not have a good chance of having sex with women.</title>
    <original_poster>fitness35754745</original_poster>
    <original_post>My lady friends husband has had a threesome before and they are looking into being able to do it again.

This guy is 6 foot 3.

For me I'm only average sized. 5 foot 9 which an average penis of 5.5 inches length and 4.8 inches girth. My looks are also average only too I would say. However I would say my personality is good towards friends, I've managed to get my lady friend to open up to me about talking about her sexual experiences so I must be doing something right. (No flirting just friends talking, I'm lucky to have a friend like her)

I'm super insecure about this and this has kept me from sleeping. I'm not exsactly worried about having threesomes or often sex, I just feel quite inferior for not.

Do average guys really have a chance with this type of thing? I cant help but feel this guys height (and possible above average penis size) is making women consider sleeping with him more. Do I have atleast a good chance? I believe I dont and that I'm at a very big disadvantage. 

I know from fair studies that the preferred penis size is bigger than average and I'm sure the preferred height for a man is above average too. I'm more worried about penis size because well, it can change the plessure the women recieves no matter good or bad.</original_post>

    <text>Well this is a lot to unpack. And I'm going to assume you're really young, so I'll go from there.

Well, you're taller than me. I assume you're more fit than I was (when I was 19 I weighed 120 lbs soaking wet). And women don't give a damn about how big your dick is.

You are the result of an unbroken chain of men lasting hundreds of thousands of years, who have had sex. You will have sex.

&amp;gt; Do average guys really have a chance with this type of thing? 

Yes. All those guys out there, they have sex. 

&amp;gt; I know from fair studies that the preferred penis size is bigger than average

If you're studying porn, stop it. Women are not looking to have an arm shoved into them. Every woman is different, and every woman can be satisfied (pending physical issues) regardless of penis size. 

Hell, lots of women are satisfied by other women, how is penis size factoring into that?</text>
