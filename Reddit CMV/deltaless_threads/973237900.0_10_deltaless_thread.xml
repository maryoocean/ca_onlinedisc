    <title>CMV: It makes sense that police would be more violent on average than other people because the job naturally appeals to control freaks.</title>

    <original_post>(Disclaimer:This isn't an ACAB post. I think many cops are good people doing a job that society needs, and I'm not here to say that every cop is bad  or violent or that we should abolish police.)

A study in the 90s found that about 40% of cops were reported for domestic violence as opposed to 10% of the general population. I know that study is outdated, and may not be entirely accurate, but it makes sense that cops would be more violent on average than regular people because the job naturally appeals to control freaks.

The job largely entails enforcing rules, giving people orders that they have to obey, and physically coercing them if they don't comply. Even if the cop's order is unlawful, you're generally advised to obey anyway and take it to court later. If someone is naturally power-hungry, this is the kind of job that would appeal to them.

Again, I'm not saying every cop is bad or violent. I think their job is necessary and I think a lot of cops are good people, but the job itself  attracts control freaks.</original_post>

    <text>First and foremost, I think that "control freak" has such a negative connotation, that it immediately paints your entire opinion in a negative light.  You can obviously refute this, but calling someone a control freak is an insult where as calling someone disciplined, lawful, and strict can be seen as compliments.  If we're using the [colloquial term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_freak) as is intended, then it would stand that the majority cops must be attempting to many of the trademark things that people with controlling personality disorders do.  This simply isn't the case

Second, your reference to the study is likely a false cause, in that the reason why cops could be reported for domestic violence is not the reason you think it is.  It could *easily* be explained by a myriad of other issues.  It could be that the hardships cops face in their jobs puts them at a higher risk for PTSD and domestic abuse is a result of said PTSD.  It could be that the 10% of the population who faces domestic abuse is only the *reported* percentage, whereas the 40% is higher because the spouses of cops would likely know other police spouses and the police themselves.  This would make it significantly easier to report.

I'd wager that *most* cops in academy right now would say they were joining to protect their families and communities.  They don't join to give people traffic tickets.  They don't join to boss people around.  Most cops genuinely think that their actions are *helping,* whether they're good cops or bad cops.  

If you look at your argument through this lens, very quickly you should see that being a cop can't 'naturally appeal' to control freaks any more than any other job.

Now, I would agree with you if you said that the power that a cop has is more easily abused by control freaks.  But that's not what your argument is.</text>

    <text>I never equated being disciplined to being a control freak. All I’m saying is that a job where you control people would naturally appeal to a control freak. 

I never said that the study was 100% accurate. I straight-up acknowledged that it might not be. You don’t need to try to explain that.

Again, I never said all, or even most cops are control freaks, just that there’s probably a higher percentage of control freaks among the police force than the general populace.</text>

    <text>I didn't say that you equated being disciplined to being a control freak.  *I'm* the one who posited that.  I'm saying that you're using control freak as a negative context, but it doesn't have to be a negative trait.  If you agree that the negative side of being a control freak is just the worst version of someone who is disciplined and determined, then you should understand how someone else could say that being a cop is a job that naturally appeals to disciplined people.  The only difference is your perspective on the individuals.   Does that make sense?

You don't have to say the study was 100% accurate.  You used it as evidence to support your argument.  If your argument is weak because your evidence is weak, then your viewpoint is weak as well.  But instead of attacking your weak evidence, I'm simply submitting some alternative perspectives for you to think about.

Finally, what does "a higher percentage" mean?  More that 50%?  Because that's the *definition* of a majority.  Regardless, I'm not saying that you said that.  I'm saying that if the job **appealed more** to control freaks, you'd expect to **see evidence** of that.  Because there is no evidence, this isn't the case.</text>
