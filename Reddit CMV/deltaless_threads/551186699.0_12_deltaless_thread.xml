    <title>CMV: Diamonds are a complete waste of money</title>
    <original_poster>DarkPhoenix07</original_poster>
    <original_post>So, I recently went into a store to look at having a piece of jewellery made. While I was there, the staff were making out like anything other than a diamond will basically be a piece of garbage.

Having no knowledge of these things, I almost agreed to purchase quite a sizeable diamond which would have blown my budget. In my mind, why buy the jewellery at all of it's just going to look like cheap trash...

Luckily, I didn't. I've now done some research into moisanitte and white sapphires and I'm really struggling to understand why diamonds are worth anything at all.

Moisanitte gems are rated on the same colour and clarity scale as diamonds so visually they conform to the same standards. Yes, a diamond is a 10 on the mohs scale, but a moisanitte is a 9.6.

Regarding the price, I was offered a visibly yellow diamond, uncertified, enhanced (has had silicone injected) 0.8ct for $1900. I can buy a 1.25ct moisanitte, perfect clarity, same cut for $700.

When trying to find out why diamonds are worth more it appears to be for two reasons:

1. About a decade ago, a diamond company (de beers I think it was) spent millions on an advertising campaign to promote them then raised the prices.

2. As a status symbol. Literally just so that people can say that "their ring cost $17,000"

Based on that, the value of a diamond is only what we percieve it to be. If that were ever to change a lot of people will have worthless, albeit pretty, rocks on their hands that cost them the same as a house deposit. 

So please, change my mind. If you can't my girlfriend is getting a moissonite ring üòâ</original_post>

    <text>Anything can be a waste of money, it just depends on how you look at it and ultimately your preferences. 

I can‚Äôt necessarily tell you that any of your points are invalid. However, speaking economically, there are a significant amount of people who don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre a waste of money at $X, or else there wouldn‚Äôt be enough demand for the given price. As a result, I don‚Äôt think you can generalize your claim to everyone, because you can‚Äôt determine everyone‚Äôs preferences for them.  

So technically, it‚Äôs not a waste of money to the people who value diamonds differently than you. If, however, it‚Äôs a waste of money in your eyes, then there really isn‚Äôt anything to say to change that.  

My point is that preferences of an informed consumer are more rigid and less apt to change in a short period of time.  Sure, you may see it one way, and that‚Äôs fine, but many more see it a different way. 

Bottom line: They‚Äôre not definitively a ‚Äúwaste of money‚Äù because people still buy them.</text>
