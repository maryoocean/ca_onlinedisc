    <title>CMV: Kink and BDSM should not be at public pride events and should be kept for 18+ ones</title>

    <original_post>To start, I am a lesbian. And I've been seeing recent controversy about this topic. 

Look, no denying that kink plays a big role in the creation of pride. It is a part of embracing sexuality and shouldn't be excluded from the community. 

However, it should not be at public pride parades. Pride should be for everyone of all ages. Many people say "stop catering to the straight capitalized ideal of what pride should be" and "pride isn't a party, it's a protest don't police us" and "children should go to disney if they want family friendly" This has nothing to do with straight rainbow capitalism. I figured out I was LGBT at age 11 and trust me if I saw a kink act in public I would be kind of disgusted. I'm still a minor now, and I'd be less disgusted but still. I know people say that it's up to you to bring your children to pride, but by making all pride events "wear whatever you want even if it's nothing" we are also kinda excluding minors from it. It's also non consensual to anyone who is exposed to such acts, because nobody wants to go to pride to see naked people right? The "think of the children" phrase holds true here. Young children and teens embracing their sexuality shouldn't be forced to see adult acts against their will. 

Again, no denying the role kink plays in the community, but it should be kept at 18+ events. There should definitely be a separate pride for people who just want to do leather and other kinks. That way, you can do whatever you want in a safe space where you know you won't offend others, and because people consented to come to an 18+ event, it's all good. 

That's just my personal opinion on it, but it seems to be the minority. I'd like to see how you guys think about this.

Edit: it appears after reading and responding to several comments, I don't really have a problem with kink, but more with public indecency. I don't care if you wear a collar or leather pants. But I'd rather not see things that could get you arrested or questioned for doing in public.</original_post>

    <text>On one hand I agree with the sentiment, and while I don’t mind seeing it, I understand why others would. On the other, sexuality is about…. Sex. 

For most adults, especially older adults, pride is about being honest in a way that they could not be when they were your age. Being free of that is an amazing feeling. It’s the one day some adults are open

As for the “Think of the children” remark. if pride where you live is known for kink and public sex, then by showing up you are giving de facto consent to seeing it. There are other prides that do not condone full nudity. Where I live, the most I’ve seen are assless chaps, and there is no sex (the bathhouse is packed though.) There are kink groups advertising for members, but that’s about as far as it goes.

“No one goes to pride to see naked people”. This is false. Many, many people go to pride to see naked people. Many, many people go to cruise. That’s why there are so many naked people having sex.

In conclusion, the LBGT community is like any other. There are all kinds of view points, and there is no way to accommodate all of them in a single event. Over time you will find your segment of the community. Maybe pride isn’t your jam, maybe it will become your jam later on. To me, pride is about all of the segments coming together to cheer each other on, from the volleyball gays, to the dykes on bikes, to the leather daddies.</text>
