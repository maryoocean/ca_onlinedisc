    <title>CMV: Why isn't Wonder Woman sexist?</title>
    <original_poster>BottomOfTheNinth</original_poster>
    <original_post>Most of what I hear and see about Wonder Woman leads me to believe she's sexist. In the depictions I've seen of her she comes from a society that banished men, she seems to be surprised when men are good (and on the opposite side of things, surprised when women are evil) and generally can't go five minutes without calling men dicks because her dad was an asshole.

To clarify, this isn't some men's rights post. I don't care on some kind of personal level if she is or isn't sexist, I just kind of want it clarified for me because a lot of people say she isn't sexist - yet in the examples I've seen of her (the Justice League cartoon, the animated Wonder Woman film, the Flashpoint comic book series...) she pretty much just hates men in general. A lot of people have also told me that while Wonder Woman herself isn't sexist, the Amazons are, so I could kind of do with that being explained too.</original_post>

    <text>Against men? The (main) reason she isn't sexist against men is that she's one person from one isolated island who has little power to influence the male-dominated world she spends most of her time in.

The best explanation I saw of this (using racism, not sexism, but the point stands): If I yell and scream and rant about how much I want to kill you, am I a murderer? Of course not. I need to actually do something to be a murderer. Same thing with racism, and sexism: no matter what Wonder Woman thinks about men, she has to actually do something to be sexist, and she just doesn't have the power to do anything about it, at least outside of her home island.</text>

    <text>This is pretty ridiculous. Racism and sexism aren't reliant on the power to affect the party they're prejudiced against. Racism and sexism are defined by hatred/prejudice/intolerance of another race or sex. 

For example: Bob goes to the town square, saying he wants to lynch all the dirty niggers because their big noses are sucking up all the white man's air. Bob is the village idiot and a drunk; no one takes Bob seriously, and everyone in the town is intelligent/sane enough to know he's a fucking moron.  Bob doesn't have the power to cause an angry mob, or enact policy against any black people. He lives in a society that knows Bob's words are hateful and ill informed. However, Bob is still a racist because he holds racist views. </text>
