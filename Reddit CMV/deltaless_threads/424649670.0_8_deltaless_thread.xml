    <title>CMV: compulsory national service is bad</title>
    <original_poster>advicemonkey69</original_poster>
    <original_post>I debate at school, and the topic is similar to this. While researching, I have come to strongly agree with the negative side and really can't see any justification to affirm the following: In the US, national service ought to be compulsory. By the way, this isn't a homework question or anything, I just really would like to hear others' opinions.

Essentially, national service isn't confined to military service, so if you would like to CMV using examples other than military, feel free.

I believe that making service compulsory defeats the purpose.  People are more driven to do well and be effective in things they choose to do out of intrinsic motivation.  Additionally, when looking at national service in terms of a draft, why? The US military already has plenty of people willing to go to war voluntarily.  

A draft would only bring citizens to resent their government.  Using utilitarian calculus is not necessary if the outcomes could be produced similarly in a way that doesn't violate peoples' autonomy, such as with voluntary service.  </original_post>

    <text>I would argue that it is likely that people are more intrinsically motivated to serve if they already have experience performing the service.  Therefore, compulsory service is a good way to teach people how to serve, and to teach the positive emotions a person may experience when serving others.  

Many people don't step out of their comfort zone simply because they haven't been taught that they are allowed to.  In fact, I think growing up people are mostly taught to toe the line.

Note that there are other ways to teach the value of serving others.  It is possible to incorporate service as part of education curriculum, like the Japanese do.  But the existence of other mechanisms does not negate the value of compulsory National Service.</text>

    <text>I want to add - because perhaps it wasn't obvious - that the education curriculum is also compulsory, so that system doesn't reduce any violations of individual autonomy.</text>
