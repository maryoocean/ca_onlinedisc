    <title>CMV: Bernie Sanders idea of free college doesn't seem like a good thing.</title>
    <original_poster>mbeogoa</original_poster>
    <original_post>This is probably because I am really bad at understanding politics and don't totally know what Sanders wants to do.  

But the money for free college would come from taxes, correct?  Does that mean that taxes would get raised or that he would just alter around the spending the government does?  Because if taxes are going to get raised that means I have to pay for my own loans that are going to take 10 years plus extra taxes so people can go for free?  That is not fair and while it seems nice, I don't have the money for that.  Nor, I'm sure, do most Americans.  

And what happens with private institutions?  Does that mean through my taxes I am paying for someone to go a $60,000 school when I couldn't go to one myself because I couldn't afford it?  Maybe that seems selfish, but that does not seem fair.  And the government should not be able to force me to pay so other people can get an easier life when I myself did not get that chance.  By the way, I know I am already being forced to pay for things I don't want, but shouldn't we be trying to lessen those instances instead of adding to them?

I mean, on paper his idea sounds great.  Free college, a better educated America, a more economically even country. YAY.  But that doesn't come for free.  And just because I am finally out of school and making a semi-decent wage doesn't mean I should have to pay for other people.  I guess that means I am anti-socialism?  Is there maybe any other way that this could be accomplished?  Like just lessening the cost of college somehow instead of totally free?

    <text>I agree with you about how the government will either have to change spending or change taxes in order to pay for this. But the taxes Bernie has been proposing are taxes on rich such as closing tax loopholes, taxing wallstreet transactions, and higher income taxes for the top 1%. Most of the taxes he has proposed so far don't effect middle class Americans too much. Also, it is fair to not want to pay for other peoples tuition, but it's not as expensive as you think. Right now colleges are responding to a large amount of people enrolling in college by accepting less and charging more then using that money to purchase new infrastructure, football fields, etc. So making college free doesn't mean you pay 40 grand for every student. Also, if private colleges want to compete with free public colleges they will lower tuition. But I'm not sure what his plan is with private colleges but I'm sure the government will change the current market structure that makes college so expensive.</text>
