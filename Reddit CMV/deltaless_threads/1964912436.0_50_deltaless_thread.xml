    <title>cmv: K-12 Educators push a false narrative that all college degrees are good investments</title>
    <original_poster>Suitable-Ad-8598</original_poster>
    <original_post>Students in high school are bombarded with pressure to go to college by educators, with high emphasis on the ranking of the schools they are accepted into and no emphasis on the majors that they choose.

Nobody is warning students that picking liberal arts majors (unless they go to an ivy league school or something like it), will probably make them financially worse off then not even getting a degree in the first place. I know a girl that did gender studies at Columbia and is working as a barista several years out of college and is in about $400,000 in debt. I went to a way worse school than Columbia and nearly all of my friends with liberal arts degrees are stuck working as cashiers and in food service. I know a ton of people who went to community colleges (which was highly frowned upon in my high school culture) who are making six figures a couple years out of school (STEM and sales).

Why are we not being honest with these kids about the consequences of incurring student debt in unusable majors? I am not saying people shouldn't have the right to make their own major choices, but this is like handing children a pack of cigarettes and not telling them it causes cancer.

Edit: I probably exaggerated when I said worse than no degree if we are talking about long-term in their livesâ€”I kind of meant in place of certifications or bootcamps.  What I should have said is that the lack of jobs in liberal arts fields seems to not be communicated to kids, which has significant negative financial consequences.

    <text>First, **Business management is a liberal arts degree**. Median salary for a business degree is $65k, median salary for all degrees is $60k, according to the [2019 Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/field-of-degree/business/business-field-of-degree.htm).  Therefore, your statement that *"Nobody is warning students that picking liberal arts majors (unless they go to an ivy league school or something like it), will probably make them financially worse off then not even getting a degree in the first place"* **is categorically false**.

Second, even within business, engineering, biomedical sciences, and CS majors, a fair number of [graduates struggle according to a 2018 Bloomberg article on the topic](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-18/is-college-worth-it-most-graduates-work-in-other-fields).  So the notion that selecting a CS or other STEM major guarantees financial success is also flawed. This is particularly true since, as the article notes, nearly 50% of graduates work in a field unrelated to their major.

Third, mounting evidence suggests that the picture for the cause of persistent underemployment for college graduates is more complex than the source of major. [Forbes magazine noted that](https://www.forbes.com/sites/prestoncooper2/2018/06/08/underemployment-persists-throughout-college-graduates-careers/?sh=20d14eed7490) "A recent report issued by Burning Glass and the Strada Institute finds that 43% of recent college graduates are underemployed in their first job out of college. Of those, two-thirds are still underemployed after five years, and just over half remain so after ten years. By contrast, just one in ten graduates who land a first job appropriate to their skill level slip into underemployment after five years."

**This suggests that the problem is not purely about the major selected** (although the problem does tend to impact some majors more than others) as much as it is about the **ability of the graduate to present themselves as an appropriate candidate to the first position**. Some of that may be due to degree inflation. Some of that may be due to a failure to stress the importance of networking, interview skills, etc. Some of that may be a lack of funding of career centers. Some of that though is also on the graduates likely not putting forward the necessary groundwork to position themselves to be successful out of the gate while still in school.

Third, unemployment rate is hardly equivalent across majors.[CS and information System Management unemployment rates are ABOVE THE OVERALL UNEMPLOYEMENT RATE](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market/college-labor-market_compare-majors.html) for recent graduates at around 5%, while education unemployment rates (one of those liberal arts degrees you denigrated are under 2%, and another liberal arts field, Foreign Languages is 3%. This means **several liberal arts majors are better, statistically speaking, for getting a first job out of college than CS degrees.**  Even generalized "Liberal Arts" has an unemployment rate of 4.3%, which is lower than CS, Industrial Engineering,  Mathematics, Architecture, Misc. Technology degrees, and Physics. 

Being successful at a career is more than just showing up to class and having the career given to you at graduation. There's a reason colleges have career days, and internship opportunities, and networking events, and professional days, and professional societies, and all of the other things that students who want to be successful are expected to spend 4 years taking advantage of. The real question to ask is "how many students who show up taking advantage of what the college really has to offer struggle?"

As someone who does recruiting for an international firm - which struggles to hire enough college graduates - my guess is damn few.</text>
