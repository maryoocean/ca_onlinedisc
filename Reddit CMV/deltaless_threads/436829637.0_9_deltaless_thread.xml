    <title>CMV: Accusations alone should not be printed by the media.</title>
    <original_poster>OGHuggles</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't care what percentage of them are true, innocent till proven guilty is a thing. The erosion of privacy and civil liberties is of great concern to me now and in the future. While I'm glad plenty of women that would have been ignored before aren't anymore, I don't think accusations should be straight up believed. I think they should be taken seriously, but they should not get media attention until a case is actually made. 

False accusations are a thing and lives have been ruined because of them. The most infamous case of this guilty before proven innocent going wrong, is the Duke Lacross case I'm sure most people have heard of.

Why should I not be concerned about this? Why is it ok to ruin people's lives based off of accusations alone?

    <text>A couple of thoughts:

If person A has accused person B of something, then "Person A accused Person B of X" is a statement of fact. I'm concerned about free speech implications of telling media sources, "this is factually true, but you are not allowed to say it."

2nd thing: can you give examples of the media "blowing up" accusations? I ask because in my observation, most media outlets are quite careful about distinguishing between allegations and convictions, and most make an effort to be neutral and include both people's claims (i.e. "Person A claims X; Person B denies this and says Y.")

(Of course, this is more true of news articles. Opinion pieces are less likely to try to balance competing claims.)</text>
