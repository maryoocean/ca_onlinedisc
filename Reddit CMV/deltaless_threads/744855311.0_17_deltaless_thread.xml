    <title>CMV: r/childfree is a toxic sub</title>
    <original_poster>SosRashneer</original_poster>
    <original_post>childfree is toxic. The sub isn't about being childfree, its about hating children as a whole. When I see a post on childfree its always about someone hating on other peoples "Crotch goblins" or "little brats". Like sometimes the child will be doing nothing at all and they're like "ugh I hate the little fucker so much like keep your crotch goblins inside your own house."
And I never really see any thoughtful discussions going on there I always only see someone hating on some other peoples children. And when someone tries to defend the child they usually get banned or downvoted. And I understand the reasoning of a child being expensive as to not having one, but if you're complaining that they're selfish that's the parents job to fix, and annoying, that can also be fixed by the parent.</original_post>

    <text>Ive had this debate with someone on Youtube who also said the same thing. Anyways, like any other ideology, the loudest people in the room get the most attention. Meanwhile, the silent majority get ignored.  1.) People will only point out the extremists of an ideology. 2.) People want somewhere they can rant without feeling judged. hence, the need for their own forum/subreddit. 3.) Alot of people who rant get "bingoed" (childfree slang for being constantly told how you should have kids or how youll regret not having kids) constantly and, thus, they need somewhere to vent. It's no different than you getting into some argument with a spouse and you calming down by venting to a friend who understands what you're going through.</text>
