    <title>CMV: Average men do not have a good chance of having sex with women.</title>
    <original_poster>fitness35754745</original_poster>
    <original_post>My lady friends husband has had a threesome before and they are looking into being able to do it again.

This guy is 6 foot 3.

For me I'm only average sized. 5 foot 9 which an average penis of 5.5 inches length and 4.8 inches girth. My looks are also average only too I would say. However I would say my personality is good towards friends, I've managed to get my lady friend to open up to me about talking about her sexual experiences so I must be doing something right. (No flirting just friends talking, I'm lucky to have a friend like her)

I'm super insecure about this and this has kept me from sleeping. I'm not exsactly worried about having threesomes or often sex, I just feel quite inferior for not.

Do average guys really have a chance with this type of thing? I cant help but feel this guys height (and possible above average penis size) is making women consider sleeping with him more. Do I have atleast a good chance? I believe I dont and that I'm at a very big disadvantage. 

I know from fair studies that the preferred penis size is bigger than average and I'm sure the preferred height for a man is above average too. I'm more worried about penis size because well, it can change the plessure the women recieves no matter good or bad.</original_post>

    <text>OP I see this a lot on /r/AskMen and /r/relationship_advice and /r/niceguys 

Aim.  Lower.

The media has ruined your expectations for what a woman should look like.  I'm not even saying that as a feminist, I hate those guys, I'm saying it as basic biology.  To paraphrase George Carlin- think about how meh the average girl looks.  Now understand that half of all women are uglier than that girl.

Go check out /r/RoastMe or /r/Skincare_Addiction for what an average girl looks like.  Is *that* what you're chasing?  Or are you eyeing those photoshopped models on r/pics?

I say this a lot but write down everything yo want in a girl.  Hot, fit, smart, funny, into weeb shit, every last thing you want in a partner.

Why would that girl go for *you?*  

OP.  Seriously.

Aim.  Lower. 

You'll hit more bullseyes if you're aiming at ~~fat~~ plus sized targets.</text>

    <text>I'm a skinny guy so personally I wouldn't go for someone who's on the larger larger side, but besides that my preferences are pretty low. Boob size not a problem, ass size not a problem, stomach not a problem etc etc.

The truth is I'm a teenage kid with social anxiety and I see the world as more demanding than it is (this is something I'm working on through therapy). So really I'm not just going for models, I'm actually going for nobody hahahaha.

Do you believe an average person like me can do well with other "average" people? 

Also I find those "perfect" people intimidating if anything so I dont really try having a close relationship with them.</text>
