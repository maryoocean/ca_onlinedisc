    <title>CMV: America doesn't need more STEM majors.</title>
    <original_poster>brotherhood4232</original_poster>
    <original_post>I used to follow the Reddit consensus that STEM = good and "basket weaving" majors = bad. I graduated with an electrical engineering degree myself. But after looking for a job myself, it doesn't seem like the job market could support a ton of more STEM majors.

I've seem very few job postings that said Entry Level. Most want 3\-5 years of experience and a host of qualifications that no new graduate will have. This means you are not only competing against other new graduates, but you are also competing against Mid\-Level STEM professionals. I think a flood of new STEM graduates would exacerbate this problem and a lot of those new engineers would be working at Starbucks. Change my view.</original_post>

    <text>This is like saying America doesn't need more chairs because there's 3 in my office and it's cluttering me.

STEM degrees only get your foot in the door, but it's all skill based. Think of it like a law degree, just because you have a law degree doesn't mean you're a good lawyer, it means you know that laws.

Just because you have a degree in electrical engineering doesn't mean you're good at it, and that doesn't mean we need less STEM degrees, it means you need to do better.</text>
