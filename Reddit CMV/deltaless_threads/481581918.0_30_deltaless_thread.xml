    <title>CMV: If I'm not guilty, I want to be tried by a judge rather than a jury</title>
    <original_poster>Mimshot</original_poster>
    <original_post>In the American criminal justice system you have the *right* to a jury trial, but you are not obligated to exercise your right a jury. It's possible to have what's known as a "bench trial" where in addition to determining the admissibility of evidence, and sentencing if convicted, the judge determines guilt or innocence as well.

Jury trials are notoriously unpredictable, therefore if I'm actually not guilty of a crime, I want a professional judging my case. Historically, bench trials result in acquittals [more often than from juries](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/judge_v_judge). I understand wanting to be judged by someone who never saw inadmissible evidence, if I'm guilty but the evidence was illegally obtained, but if I'm actually not guilty, why should I take a chance with a jury?

Change my view.

    <text>I would say it depends entirely on the crime and the defendant.

Juries tend to be swayed more by emotion and empathy than judges.  so, for example in the UK, common wisdom is that driving offenses are best tried by a jury[best for the defendant!], as most members of the jury can empathise with going over the speed limit, being distracted by driving etc.

"juries have a poorer record of convicting drivers, especially if the victim is a cyclist or a pedestrian"

Now say the crime was a someone cycling dangerously.  Juries are far less likely to empathise with them as most of population doesn't regularly cycle, and often sees cyclists as law breaking menaces.  Judge would be the way to go.

Not just for the crime either; I would imagine that a homely white middle-class mother would have a better chance of ellicting sympathy/empathy from a jury than a 19 year old working class black man.</text>
