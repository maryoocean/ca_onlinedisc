    <title>CMV: Lord of the Rings are great films, but it is not a good trilogy</title>
    <original_poster>This_The_Last_Time</original_poster>
    <original_post>This is inspired by a recent Movie Fight debate about what is the best movie trilogy (check it out from YouTube). 

I'd argue, that even though I LOVE Lord of the Rings movies, and have seen them dozens of times, it is not a good movie trilogy. For one simple reason: the movies do not work separately. 

I think for a movie trilogy to be good or better than most, the parts of the trilogy have to work both individually as single movies and as pieces of a greater whole. 

LOTR does not work as individual films. None of the themes or storylines are resolved within a single film, with the exception of characters who are both introduced and killed within one film (Boromir, Shelob). 

LOTR films are individual films only in technical sense: they all have their separate release dates, each one ends with ending credits, etc. But the story contained in these films does not work when viewed as a single piece, because you do not get to see the big picture. LOTR films are really a single film, single story, released in three separate parts. 

I think for a trilogy to be good, or great, any single movie in it has to work without any companion pieces. Sequels should not be requirements. Story cannot be truly great if it does not end. Imagine if Fellowship of the Ring was a box-office bomb, and the two others films were never released. Who would call Fellowship a self-contained, resolved film? It would still be a good film, just without resolution. Audiences would think, what then, only to be answered, nothing. A good story does not ask questions it does not try to answer. 

Then look at Godfather. If Godfather Part 2 was never released, Godfather 1 would still work perfectly on its own. Part 2 enchances the first one, and vice versa, but neither requires the other.  And no one needs the third one. 

Lord of the Rings films are great. But in reality they are a trilogy only in technical terms, as the story within is one single story, not three complementing ones. If you only watch one of the films, but not the others, story is flawed and incomplete. If you watch the films out of chronological order, nothing makes sense. All the plot threads and all the character archs in the trilogy take multiple films to reach their conclusions, with the aforementioned exception of characters who are introduced and killed within a single movie. 

An exceptional trilogy of films should work both individually, where you only see one of them (not necessarily even the first one), and still feel like you got everything you needed and wanted, and as parts of a bigger whole. Lord of the Rings films do not work without the other parts of the trilogy. Without them, story is incomplete, unresolved, and the character archs unfinished.

    <text>I think my main question is why do you think that a good trilogy must have three movies that work on their own? 

Also I think you would find that with your examples of movie trilogies where the movies stand on their own, what you really have is the first movie stands on its own, and the other two do not. Try watching Return of the Jedi without ever seeing the Empire Strikes Back. Even with the Empire Strikes Back, watching it without having seen A New Hope robs you of a lot of context and leaves you confused.

These Trilogies, which I agree are good, are really successful first movies where no sequel was planned until the first movie became a hit. Whereas with something like Lord of the Rings, each movie was planned as part of a trilogy from the beginning. LotR actually does have a plot with resolution, but also builds towards the end. It should be viewed as a whole, but each movie is certainly distinct. Really the chief difference between the Lord of the Rings and the Trilogies you describe is that LotR was planned out from the start, and so the first movie does not totally stand alone. But this also allows the director and writers to put together a more cohesive story, and not worry about trying to join together the stories of the first movie and its sequels. </text>
