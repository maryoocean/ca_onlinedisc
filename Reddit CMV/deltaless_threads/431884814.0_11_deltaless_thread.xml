    <title>CMV: Islam is not a religion of peace or tolerance.</title>
    <original_poster>VanGoghingSomewhere</original_poster>
    <original_post>The Koran speaks of women as property, Mohammed, Islam's prophet himself was a murderer and pedophile/polygamist who thought women had inherently deficient minds. Today, even moderate Muslim men in many parts of the world violently ensure their wives cover their faces and bodies or "adornments" while outside of the house or bedroom. ISIS/The IS/Taliban, etc. all follow the holy text of the Koran. Jihad has existed as long as Islam. Muslim evangelization has been by the sword as far back as the religion dates. What many explain to be Islamic Extremism is usually just Islamic fundamentalism. Liberal Muslim, LGBTQ Muslim, Muslim Feminist--these are all oxymorons.    
  
  EDIT:

For anyone saying that violence and intolerance are only a misinterpretation of subtext (though many who are educated on the Koran in the thread have explained that Allah's word is strictly set and not to be interpreted), I encourage you to read these passages. If the Koran is a text to be interpreted by it's followers, how do you spin these words to be peaceful or tolerant? I truly don't get it.  
  
&amp;gt;Quran (2:191-193) - "And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out. And Al-Fitnah [disbelief or unrest] is worse than killing..."  

&amp;gt;Quran (4:89) "...But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks."  
  

&amp;gt;Quran (5:33) - "The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement"
Quran (8:67) - "It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he had made a great slaughter in the land..."  
  

&amp;gt;Quran (17:16) - "And when We wish to destroy a town, We send Our commandment to the people of it who lead easy lives, but they transgress therein; thus the word proves true against it, so We destroy it with utter destruction."  
  

&amp;gt;Tabari 9:69 "Killing Unbelievers is a small matter to us" The words of Muhammad, prophet of Islam.
Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 484: - “Allah said, ‘A prophet must slaughter before collecting captives. A slaughtered enemy is driven from the land. Muhammad, you craved the desires of this world, its goods and the ransom captives would

  EDIT 2:

Any attempt to change my view in this thread has been a apologist answer citing false equivalency, or an appeal to emotion by trying to separate the wheat from the chaff (nice Muslims = peaceful Islam).</original_post>

    <text>Read the entire thread, just to make sure that any of my points weren't covered.

Islam is like communism, in that "no true" version of it has been practised, since the true version can only manifest when we're under one Islamic/Communistic super-state. Islam is peaceful because once all the world converts (or dies) to Islam, then that means that they'll be no more infidels left to kill. I mean sure those passages seem violent, but that's only because we haven't reached their ideal state of peace yet. The road to good intentions is paved, and a two-way street, and a highway mentioned in an AC/DC song.

I believe that answers your question on how the passages you've cited can be considered peaceful

Also bare with this second argument, as it only seems like an "appeal to emotion" as you put in your second edit.

&amp;gt;What many explain to be Islamic Extremism is usually just Islamic fundamentalism. Liberal Muslim, LGBTQ Muslim, Muslim Feminist--these are all oxymorons.

Not oxymorons, they're just examples of bad Muslims. I myself eat meat on Good Fridays all the time (well, not *all* the time: You can't exaclty eat meat on Good Friday if it's not Good Friday), not out of spite but because I just happen to have a real hunkering for a burger on that friday of the year since the lord blessed me with that temptation, and does that make me a bad Christian? Yes, yes it does, and I'm probably going to hell for that.

What people don't seem to understand is that it is possible to have disagreements with your god (Lucifer proves it). Just because someone says that God hates cigarettes, doesn't mean that that one person hates cigarettes. He's just stating his diety's opinion. That one, oneself, could like them beause of their rich taste, or their addictive qualities, or the smell of burning, or simply because smoking is cool. God might hate them because smoking gives you lung-cancer. Or does smoking give you lung cancer because God hates it? Ah, it's the old "Euthyphro dilemma" again...

Anyways, navel gazing is fun. Or it was fun until I wiki'd the name of the dilemma I was having. Really ruins the originality of whatever thought I was having.</text>
