    <title>CMV: College Athletes are modern day indentured servants and deserve to be paid.</title>
    <original_poster>yobittner</original_poster>
    <original_post>It’s about time we start paying student athletes, or at the very least grant all participants full scholarships. Coming from a Division I athlete myself, I never really thought of the subject until undergoing the most stressful past few months of my life. If being a student isn’t enough, try waking up by 8am for your first class, finishing around one, and then going to practice for 4-5 hours. After practice, you grab a bite to eat and by the team you even have a chance of starting your course work, the clock says 8pm. It’s looking like an all-nighter, oh wait that’s every other night, and you are already exhausted from practice.

According to Forbes, the NCAA basketball tournament, also known as “March Madness,” allows for CBS to make more than $1 billion off the games. Athletic conferences receive millions of dollars from the NCAA when their teams make it far in the tournament. It is even estimated that as a whole the NCAA makes $6 billion annually. (It’s registered as a non-profit by the way…) Meanwhile student athletes are either going in debt to pay for school, barely have any spending money, or are just fortunate enough to be one of the few that are financially well off. Quite frankly, I feel as though it’s just not fair that an organization can make so much money off of people who don’t receive any benefits. Its modern day indentured servitude.

You can only look back at the video game dilemma to see how much the NCAA generates off of unpaid workers. NCAA Football and March Madness were discontinued after athletes found players that looked exactly like them. Although names were not able to be used, the NCAA would not only have someone on the cover, but have identical players in the game. There was a settlement in which the game was finally discontinued because of the outrageous greed by a nonprofit organization.

One logical argument that’s often ignored is that an athlete can be compared to a cafeteria worker in a university dining hall. Both represent the school and provide a service that generates money. However, the only one who is paid is the cafeteria worker. Does that make any sense? Why would someone that generates less money for the school receive better treatment? It’s common sense…

At the very least, I believe all NCAA athletes should be eligible for full scholarships. There shouldn’t be any limitations at all. You would be very surprised to realize that actually the majority of NCAA student athletes do not receive any sort of athletic financial aid. A lot of this has to do with the limitation on the number of scholarships per team due to policies such as Title IX. Not only are you paying the school through your hard work, but you also might be literally paying the school…

I think what you're ignoring is that not all college sports make money, and not all levels of every sport make money.  In DI sports, basically football and basketball make money, the other sports don't. In DII and DIII sports, none of them turn a profit.  You ask me, should athletes for *money sports* be paid?  Absolutely!  But only because they're programs sell our 10,000 seat arenas and 80,000 seat stadiums, with corporate sponsorship, lucrative TV contracts, and millions of viewers watching at home.  The school doesn't make money by sending the Rowing team 3 states over and putting them up in a hotel for the conference championship, especially considering they're also providing scholarships to several of them.  I don't see how they'd be justified payign them.  The end result would be univesrities just cutting their rowing team.

As far as "all athletes" should get scholarships, again, you run into problems with money.  DIII schools have no athletic scholarships, period.  DII has very relatively few scholarships, and students who want to be on the X team try out and play by choice, but if they have a problem with the time commitment, or are struggling with their academics or personal life they are under no obligation to continue.  Forcing all programs that lose money as it is to provide scholarhsips *and* pay athletes seems like it would result in killing sports.

Honestly, for DI money-sport athletes, considering the way they treat the academic side of their "student" athletes, i think the best solution would be to offer either/or.  Either a scholarship, or direct compensation without rights to take classes.  A college education has value, but only if you make the most out of it.  Giving students the option to take, say 25,000 of tuition in cash + room and board would better compensate those who don't want to study, while at the same time better motivate those students who choose the scholarship, since they are actively giving up cash income *today* to get an education.</text>
