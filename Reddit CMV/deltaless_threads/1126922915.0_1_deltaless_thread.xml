    <title>CMV: Porn ruins people's lives.</title>
    <original_poster>OutlinedSnail</original_poster>
    <original_post>I am posting this here after making this argument elsewhere on reddit. I saw lots of people there arguing that porn in fact does not ruin people's lives, so I accept that possibly my view is flawed.

 I believe that porn ruins lives because :

Porn ruins people's perceptions of themselves and the opposite gender. It ruins marriages and relationships. It van cost people tons of money and even their jobs. It can also lead down disgusting or illegal roads. 

Not to mention the people who are IN the porn. Porn can ruin them as well. More women than you realize are forced or drugged into porn. And no this isn't just dark web porn, this includes porn on pornhub. I guarantee you've seen many videos with blackmailed, drugged, kidnapped, or trafficked women in them. Porn ruins those women's lives as well.

EDIT: I do not mean that watching porn will inevitably ruin your life, i mean it CAN ruin lives, and does more often than people realize/admit.</original_post>

    <text>Objectively, porn does ruin people's lives; it just doesn't ruin the life of everyone who engages with it, or most. 'Can' only implies potential harm, but since theres plenty of factual examples of harm, it's not unfair to say 'does'.</text>

    <text>Sure, but then the bar is set so low that pretty much everything fits that criterium by default.


Can you name something that can never cause harm under any circumstances?</text>

    <text>A baby spills it on itself, gets it in its windpipe and drowns. 

The cup falls to the ground and someone steps on a shard and bleeds to death. 

Someone drinks it and the caffeine is just too much for their heart and they die.</text>

    <text>I had never considered the possibility of drowning in a cup of tea before. Iâ€™ll be more careful in future.</text>

    <text>OP counts harm caused in the production process of the object as part of the argument. So tea is not a good pick considering its role in the colonial ventures of the British Empire.</text>

    <text>That's true, but not what I was getting at. Both 'can' and 'does' are technically appropriate. My point was that the comment I initially replied to is redundant.</text>

    <text>I don't think it's redundant. It would be redundant under the strict technical interpretation, but OP's thread only makes sense if you presume that "does" is meant as something stronger than the mere potential that it might occasionally sometimes cause harm. So under the technical interpretation, this entire thread would be trivial.</text>

    <text>Exactly, 'does' means that there is an objective, factual harm, that IS caused; which there is here. 'Does' does not imply that all interactions with porn cause harm (that would be employing an all-or-nothing way of thinking about it, which is rarely the right interpretation, and certainly not in this case)

Again, your right, 'can' is less strong, and refers to potential; but with a disregard for an actual harm, which does objectively occur.</text>

    <text>This statement doesn't argue any points i stated in my post. How is this comment supposed to change my view if it doesn't give different view points on anything I said?</text>
