    <title>CMV: If you think abortion is murder, you can only have 1 specific opinion on it.</title>
    <original_poster>Send_Me_Trump_Nudes</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let's start this by saying I don't want to have any arguments about whether abortion is murder or not. I really feel like someone is going to think I am pro-life, I am not. However, my argument is basically saying that IF and only IF you do believe abortion is murder, you can only have the following specific opinion on it:

Abortion is wrong in all cases, INCLUDING rape, except for cases where the mother's health is at risk. 

So basically the main argument is that even rape shouldn't be aborted if abortion really is murder to someone. Here is why. 

If abortion is murder, then it isn't OK. Pretty simple right?
But then you have to get down to the different nuances. Rape is absolutely horrible, but if we assume abortion is murder; murdering because you were raped still doesn't make sense.

Murdering because you might die and you don't want to take a gamble makes sense, as horrible as it is, which is why mothers health is the one exception.

Would like to also include that I am not simply talking about pro-lifers, as there are many variances and AFAIK not all pro-lifers necessarily think abortion is literally murder. 

Thank you, now change my view. :)

Edit: Thank you for the replies, my view has been changed. 

 Just to clarify the murder thing I was only using because I see a lot of pro-lifers use it. I don't really care about the specific wording that should be used, point is that you are killing someone. or someone is dying. Whatever word you would like, imagine I used it.

    <text>Not all killing of a human life is murder. Murder is a very specific legal term that is an unjustified and unlawful killing of a human. 

Legal killings are : Self defense, defense of another, during war, as a function of a legally issued execution, and a pure non-negligent accident. 

It is fully reasonable to consider abortion killing of a human life but not murder because it falls into the self defense category, or is its own category of legal killings. It is also fully reasonable that there are types of abortion that are murder, and types that are not. Factors like if the child had a debilitating genetic disorder/developmental disability, was the result of rape, or is viable are all factors that can be included to determine if it is murder or not to have it aborted. </text>
