    <title>CMV: it is a jerk move to play music while camping within earshot of other campers.</title>

    <original_post>We put a tent up in a state park campground for about 4 weeks out of the summer. Most of the time you can just hear nature, people talking, kids playing, lots of birds and squirrels  . Every 5th day or so, there is someone who brings some Bluetooth speakers so they can listen to music , but loud  enough  that people in a half dozen sites nearby get to ‘enjoy’ whatever they are playing. 

Right now I’m cooking dinner and the guys next to me are playing U2, Dave Matthew Band and similar inoffensive crap.

This would be entirely normal in a backyard gathering, but once you reserve to be in a public campground, it becomes selfish, intrusive,  rude.

Am I wrong?

(I know it’s a known risk of car camping. I’m not really  mad. More rolling my eyes. I wish they’d shut that crap off.  )

    <text>I think it's very important to discern what levels of music we're talking about. In some comments you used the word 'blaring' or 'blasting' (can't recall which), but others it sounds like they just had any music on that could be heard more than 10 ft away. 

As a frequent camper, the answer is somewhere in the middle and also depends on the campground. When some guys started blasting Party in the USA at 8am for the whoooole camp to hear, everyone was pissed. Someone playing relatively quiet music that can be heard at your campsite, and maybe the next one, but isn't so loud you can't still enjoy your evening doesn't cross that line in my book. It's unclear to me from your story if these guys crossed that line. 

Another important consideration: genre does matter and I have a general rule to only play chill, camping-friendly music. As much as I love Tool, I save that for private times. Since you said these guys were playing chill, unoffensive music, I don't really think they were acting out of line.</text>
