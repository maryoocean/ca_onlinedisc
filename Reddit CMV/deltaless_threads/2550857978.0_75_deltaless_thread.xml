    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>Your view is a very strawman point of view. Firs there are very few people who believe that all or even many cops are bad people. The problem is that of the one bad apple, and circling around the wagon. I do not know about you but I and the vast majority of the population do not need the presence of cops to make them stay away from crime. There are places that have no cops and have only minimal crimes. Even in the so called high crime neighborhoods, the vast majority of residents are not involved in crimes. Cops presence may limit but does not prevent criminal activity and sometimes the cops are involved in the crimes by protecting the criminals or having the criminals criming for them.</text>
