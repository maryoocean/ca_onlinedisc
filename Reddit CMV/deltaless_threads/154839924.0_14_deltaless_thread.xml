    <title>CMV: I consider the Nordic model the best socio-economic model to base a country around &amp;amp; the best compromise between the right and left</title>

I believe the free market combined with a social safety net reduces poverty which benefits everyone. High level of education, highly efficient administration effectively invests into the society, providing multiple incentives and angles of growth.  

People have trust in their government, in their administration and how their taxes are used. This leads to a high level of security; problems are laid off them and ultimately this leads to a high level of happiness.

Low level of income inequality, high GDP and PPP per capita, liberal laws, low crime, low corruption, good healthcare, great education, low pollution. What's not to like?  

But all this does not obstruct high profit businesses from investing and all that is asked from businesses is that they treat their employees with respect and pay them enough so they can make a decent living. True, most thrift-based businesses would be discouraged from investing but Imo in the developed country there should be no place for such an exploiting business style.  

My only doubt is whether such a model could adapt to a larger country because in all Nordic cases we deal with low populations, large areas and often, decent levels of natural resources and admittedly this does create conditions for easier administration and sustainable economic growth.  

CMV, thanks in advance!

    <text>I'm not sure how much of a compromise that is. You mention many leftist positions with regards to social and welfare issues, then in regards to business say that the regulation is "not that bad." It certainly works quite well there, and there are examples of leftist governments working poorly, but it is not a compromise, Scandinavian politics is left of most, if not all, developed countries.</text>

    <text>Whether Scandinavian countries are more "left" than most, doesn't mean they aren't born out of social-democratic compromise. It's still capitalism. Just with a shiny new coat of paint. If they had "built a new house" and replaced capitalism, I'd agree with you.</text>
