    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>"To protect and serve" is just a slogan and legally meaningless. They have no constitutional duty to do either thing. The courts have been extremely clear about this.  
Are there good cops? Absolutely. Are they working in departments where the systemic structure means that they are going to end up doing their community harm at some point? Absolutely.   


The presence of "good" or well meaning cops does not mean that ACAB people are somehow thinking in black and white. They have seen the damage that these organizations have done to their communities. They are not looking at individuals, they are looking at the uniform, something that any "good" person would do themselves. To continue to wear it knowing full well what it entails says something about a person, and it isn't a good thing.   


What I find most curious about your argument OP is that I have heard the exact same argument made about nazis in the past in almost the same way.   


OP have you ever experienced the more negative aspects of law enforcement yourself?   


I see stories like this all the time:

Law enforcement isn't what people think it is at all, and contrary to what most people think, almost everyone commits crimes, even unknowingly, on an almost daily basis.</text>
