    <title>CMV: The sale of organs should be legal</title>
    <original_poster>Guilty-Hope1336</original_poster>
    <original_post>One of my most radical political opinions is that organ sale should be completely legal. It should of course, be regulated so that people aren't taken advantage of and the rich don't get a monopoly on organs. But it should be legal. Like organ wait times are insane for people, something like 3-5 years for a kidney, and if allowing people to sell their organs lowers this wait time, then we should do it. 

The biggest argument I have heard is that the poor will be coerced into selling their organs because they need money. But then why shouldn't they be able to? It's their body, they should be able to do with it what they want. If they want to use it make money, why should we stop them? If it will save a life, why should we stop them? 

I also find the argument of commodification stupid. Just because it feels uncomfortable doesn't mean anything. People sell their labour and thus, their muscle strength in physically demanding jobs like construction. People in Universities sell their ideas and, thus their brain power. You can also sell your sperm. Why should we treat organs differently? We all sell some portion of ourselves to make money, so why not organs?

My preferred system would be that people sell their organs to the government, who pays them a fair price and the organs will be distributed by the triage system, as is currently utilised. This way we can ensure that the people who truly need organs can get them, not just those who can pay more. But I would also allow people to sell their organs to a specific individual, if they so choose. This would also apply to blood and bone marrow.</original_post>

    <text>People often think about this in the lens of poor people in their country vs rich.   


But what would actually happen is third world country populations would become organ farms for first world countries. Think of all the warlords, slumlords, and human traffickers that would keep hundreds of women in captivity to just pop off off-spring so a new organ can be sold?

The actual problem with organs right now is supply. Adding a price tag on it will increase supply, but in exploitive ways. Why not encourage organ donation through educational campaigns?</text>

    <text>This is it. Like any other valuable asset, a place with low supply controls will supply rich countries, and will break a shitload of ethics codes to do it. The Island anyone?</text>
