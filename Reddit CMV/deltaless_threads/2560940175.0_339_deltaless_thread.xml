    <title>cmv: There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as an “American”</title>

    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>You are a resident of the United States of America, but the usa is not "america", and taking up the title of the original murdered people is a bit over the top. This subject opens a few cans of worms. If living in United States makes one "american", why is there such a divide when it comes to minority groups? You don't call a hispanic "american", you don't call many indigenous "american" without attaching african, never called the murdered tribes "american"(still calling them Indians) and in all likelihood your genetics come from europe, which makes you European if nothing else. There seems a pattern of appropriating names and cultures.</text>
