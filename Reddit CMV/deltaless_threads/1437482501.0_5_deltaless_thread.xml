    <title>CMV: Kink and BDSM should not be at public pride events and should be kept for 18+ ones</title>
    <original_poster>akoudagawaismywaifu</original_poster>
    <original_post>To start, I am a lesbian. And I've been seeing recent controversy about this topic. 

Look, no denying that kink plays a big role in the creation of pride. It is a part of embracing sexuality and shouldn't be excluded from the community. 

However, it should not be at public pride parades. Pride should be for everyone of all ages. Many people say "stop catering to the straight capitalized ideal of what pride should be" and "pride isn't a party, it's a protest don't police us" and "children should go to disney if they want family friendly" This has nothing to do with straight rainbow capitalism. I figured out I was LGBT at age 11 and trust me if I saw a kink act in public I would be kind of disgusted. I'm still a minor now, and I'd be less disgusted but still. I know people say that it's up to you to bring your children to pride, but by making all pride events "wear whatever you want even if it's nothing" we are also kinda excluding minors from it. It's also non consensual to anyone who is exposed to such acts, because nobody wants to go to pride to see naked people right? The "think of the children" phrase holds true here. Young children and teens embracing their sexuality shouldn't be forced to see adult acts against their will. 

Again, no denying the role kink plays in the community, but it should be kept at 18+ events. There should definitely be a separate pride for people who just want to do leather and other kinks. That way, you can do whatever you want in a safe space where you know you won't offend others, and because people consented to come to an 18+ event, it's all good. 

That's just my personal opinion on it, but it seems to be the minority. I'd like to see how you guys think about this.

Edit: it appears after reading and responding to several comments, I don't really have a problem with kink, but more with public indecency. I don't care if you wear a collar or leather pants. But I'd rather not see things that could get you arrested or questioned for doing in public.</original_post>

    <text>As long as they stay on the floats and aren't physically interacting with people viewing the Pride Parade, why does it matter? What's the worst that could happen? I've been going to Pride Parades since I was 4 and there has always been kink stuff. I either didn't know what it was or didn't care. And often the kink stuff actually has a real benefit, by promoting safe sex. I have seen them passing out condoms and pamphlets about PrEP, for instance.</text>

    <text>You know what's weird?  I don't mind my (now 8 year old son) seeing that stuff up on a float.  I used the example of how last year I decided to skip the parade because of a man with chaps, a pink dildo up his ass, and nothing else save for a leash.

I don't want my son to stand next to a straight woman nude with a dildo up her ass either.  It's irritating to me that I CAN find parades where the attendants don't do that for everything but pride events.  It's frustrating.  On a float I can explain things and give a talk about the history involved.  If half the crowd is also doing it that same autistic son will be ramming stuff up his ass 20 minutes after we get home.

I want pride events that are family friendly, damnit.</text>

    <text>I have no proof of that and it's only an hypothesis but linking LGBT with BDSM/exhibitionism imaging may have been counter productive at some point as it painted homosexuals as being obsessed with partying and sex instead of sending the message "we're like everybody else"</text>

    <text>The same can be said with having Budweiser floats many of the other groups that sponsor Pride and make floats.</text>

    <text>Why would other parts of Pride, such as floats done by beer companies, not also encourage the partying stereotype?</text>

    <text>Nobody will bat an eye at floats and it's not pushing any stereotype or revendication. It's the kind of things you expect from any parade.</text>

    <text>Maybe I didn't express myself properly: there's obviously absolutely no physical danger to people dancing on float naked or any kinky costume. I was just pointing that they may give a wrong idea of LGBT people that is counter productive in the great scheme of things</text>

    <text>Right, and I was pointing out that other floats also give people the wrong idea</text>

    <text>Can you give an example of a type of float that is representative of a parade and give a wrong idea? 

I mean you can see advertising float like a Budweiser one in all parade so it's not really outstanding nor giving any specific message.</text>
