    <title>CMV: It's a good idea for bank tellers to be armed.</title>
    <original_poster>ImAwesomeLMAO</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm not entirely passionate about second amendment rights, but it just seems like a rational solution to the problem of an armed robber coming in every now and then. This won't help with any nonviolent thieves that use sneaking, hacking or bad checks, but mostly just to protect the customers and the employees themselves.

Assuming the employees are at least a little trustworthy, there's nothing to worry about. 

This isn't something I've done more than some Googling on, but it just occurred to me. Happy Friday guys.</original_post>

    <text>If you are a bank owner, it's probably not a great idea. There are significant costs to train and equip armed guards. Let's try to calculate the savings, assuming the guard is 100% effective:

Number of bank branches in the US: [96,339](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303277704579347223157745640)

Number of bank robberies in a year: [7,189](http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/data/table_23.html)

Average take from a bank robbery: [$4,029](http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/data/table_23.html)

So, there is about a 7.5% chance that your bank will be robbed, and you will save $4,029, which is an expected gain of about $300. You can't even buy a decent gun for $300, let alone train someone to use it. And keep in mind that you will likely be liable if the employee you give it to misuses it.</text>
