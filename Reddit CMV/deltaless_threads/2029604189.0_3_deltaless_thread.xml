    <title>CMV: Sustainability, from a philosophical perspective, is misguided</title>
    <original_poster>Pyropeace</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've been an advocate of sustainability for a while. However, I've recently begun to question the underlying assumptions behind the sustainability movement. 

Nothing is truly, infinitely sustainable. The sun will eventually go nova, killing everyone on earth (if humans haven't already gone extinct by then). If humanity manages to escape Earth, then the universe will likely perish as well, depending on what model you accept. The universe is in a constant state of change, and nothing lasts forever. Is it better to be moderately happy for a long period of time or extremely happy for a short period of time? When talking about entire societies, I tend towards the latter, though on an individual basis I tend towards the former. 

Essentially, my question is this; what is the value in things that last a long time in a universe where nothing is eternal?</original_post>

    <text>You are talking about things that will impact humanity (if there is still even humanity) well after your lifetime, the lifetime of your possible children, your possible grandchildren and the children of your grandchildren. When people talk about sustainability we talk about things that impact our own lifetime, or perhaps our children's.</text>

    <text>Longer than that.  The earth won't be destroyed by the sun for billions of years.  That's your great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great...(keep saying "great" without stopping for the next 2 years)... grandchildren.</text>
