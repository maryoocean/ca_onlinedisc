    <title>CMV: Some cultural traditions don't deserve respect and outsiders should actively make an attempt to change them.</title>

I came across this video today, in which brides in a certain culture are kidnapped of the streets and are physically held and forced into marriage by their family (sometimes even just their distant extended family). In many cultures there are many flaws but almost all modern societies don't condone the forced kidnap and eventual rape of women. This culture will continue to cause real tangible and direct harm to individuals unless it is somehow changed from external pressure. This tradition doesn't deserve to be respected and deserves active attempts to destroy it by well meaning outsiders. I am trying to see if there is any argument behind the common view of "we must respect all cultures". I don't see how or why a culture that deprives people of fundamental human rights deserves respect, and how it is not the duty of outsiders to try to stop them. Change my view </original_post>

    <text>I would argue that this saying is driven by necessity not ideology. I think you underestimate how difficult it is to change a culture. Exerting influence on another country/culture is rarely accepted by that country's inhabitants, or by other countries. As terrible as the situation in North Korea is, China doesn't want other countries (US) to interfere there because of it's strategic location. Like-cultured countries tend to align, so even subtly influencing another country can be seen as an aggressive action by that country's ideological/regional allies. 

In addition, if the inhabitants of such a country may actively resist such influence on their culture. You can end up creating a common enemy for that countries people that allows an even worse regime to come to power.

Ultimately, respecting another culture promotes trade, exchange of ideas, and mixing of people. If yours really is "the better culture", then eventually that other culture will start to adopt similar beliefs. This kind of thing takes generations sometimes, but there isn't a better way. I'm sure it can feel like inaction, but sometimes it takes courage and patience to be a slow and deliberate advocate for change.</text>
