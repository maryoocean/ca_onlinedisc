    <title>CMV: Ivory confiscated from poachers should be destroyed, not sold to fund Elephant/Rhino conservation efforts.</title>

    <original_post>Hello CMV,

A post popped up in /r/worldnews today about [how Kenya has confiscated and will burn $270million dollars worth of poached Elephant Ivory](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/439fg2/kenya_to_destroy_largest_ever_ivory_stockpile_in/).  Many of the comments stated the opinion that this is a waste to burn it, and that the product should be sold at a very low price, to flood the market, and to raise money for conservation efforts.

I believe that destroying the Ivory is the best solution.  The sale of Ivory was banned in 1989, and the two legal sales that have happened since have [revived the demand in the markets that they were sold](http://www.economist.com/news/international/21595932-push-stop-poaching-and-save-elephants-extinction-up-smoke). 

Many people compared destroying the product to the ineffectiveness of similar practices in the drug war. Drug manufactures can afford to lose a large percentage of their shipments because the profit is so high, and most profitable drugs come from plants, or other resources that are renewable and not as scarce as Elephant Ivory.

I would love to hear your opinions, and will be taking them in to full consideration. Feel free to make suggestions about other potential solutions I haven't considered here.  I have an interest in (but limited knowledge of) economics, feel free to use macroeconomics to explain your view!

So, Change My View Reddit.

    <text>Destroying the ivory does not make rational economic sense.

The ivory in the warehouse represents harm already done. Whatever happens to the ivory in the warehouse, the elephants it was taken from is still dead.  

Destroy the ivory: the Gray Market demand for ivory does not change. Knowing the market demand still exists, hunters are incentivised to hunt more elephants to make up for the ivory they've lost.

Sell the ivory: the Gray Market demand is temporarily met. Without a guaranteed demand, there is less of an incentive to kill more elephants for their ivory. The proceeds from the sale of ivory can be used for conservation purposes. </text>
