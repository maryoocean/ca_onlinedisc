    <title>CMV: Human Life has no innate worth due to the Laws of Supply and Demand</title>

&amp;amp;nbsp;

So first I'd like to define the difference between Human Life and a Human Being. My premise rests on defining the two separately. Let me assure you that I feel that a Human Being with a developed consciousness is irreplaceable. However, due to the recent surge in discussions on abortion, I've been hammering out the details on a premise I'd like to present here in an effort to determine any flaws in it: **Human Life has no innate value, as there are over 7 billion humans on this planet, and the Laws of Supply and Demand dictate that an unborn child therefore only holds subjective worth.**


I noticed that many people seem to innately assume that unborn children are a highly valuable commodity, which confuses me, as any of 2-4 billion women could essentially produce billions more embryos at any given time. While a specific embryo or fetus can absolutely hold subjective value to a person, which is why I support laws that punish the murder of a pregnant person as though it was a double homicide, I don't see the issue with a person choosing to rid themselves of an unwanted pregnancy; nothing of inherent or subjective value was lost. While I'm not a fan of abortions used as matter of convenience (I'd much prefer universal healthcare and a robust Sex Ed curriculum), I see an abortion as nothing more than a medical procedure with no morality involved any more than a kidney transplant is "moral."

    <text>I agree with your conclusion, but not your reasoning.

Most comments have failed to address, and perhaps to understand, your distinction between human life and human being.

It is true that human life without human being is not valuable to most people, but it is because they view these things as inseperable. I think that is what the commentors are trying to express.

So the issue of abortion or other acts that people consider justified that ends a life without moral reasoning are because the life is lacking in Being, and here's the important part I think you have overlooked, NOT because it is too abundant aka. Over supplied.

In other words people are willing to dispense with all life that is without being, or at least those that do not value life itself, and the quantity or lack of such has no bearing on that consideration.</text>
