    <title>CMV: It's fair to compare carnists (people who eat meat) to nazis.</title>
    <original_poster>Arkenhiem651</original_poster>
    <original_post>1) Carnists think that animals are inferior; Nazis think that jews are inferior
2) Carnists put animals in camps; Nazis put jews in camps
3) Both jews and animals attempt to escape
4) Both are/were normalized. Anyone who goes against these beliefs were/are suppressed and treated as illogical/emotionally driven
5) Both are unnecessary 
6) Both are/were driven long distances and murdered
7) emotional detachment from the victims
8) Both are sentient
Alex Hershaft a holocaust survivor also used this comparison along with other vegan holocaust survivors.
"We're focusing on the victims rather than the cancer of oppression itself",[8] and that "I noted with horror the striking similarities between what the Nazis did to my family and my people, and what we do to animals we raise for food: the branding or tattooing of serial numbers to identify victims, the use of cattle cars to transport victims to their death, the crowded housing of victims in wood crates, the arbitrary designation of who lives and who dies — the Christian lives, the Jew dies; the dog lives, the pig dies."[6

Also Alex Hershshaft looks extremely young considering he's 88 and survived concentration camps. That's irrelevant but I thought it interesting enough to mention considering he claims it's due to his vegan diet.

Edit: I know I say Jews but this also applies to other victims of the concentration camps such as Slavic peoples, gays and communists</original_post>

    <text>This is a ridiculous argument. Should we lock up animals who kill other animals? By your logic, they're committing "murder".</text>

    <text>What about people in poor, rural hunting communities who do need to kill animals to survive? What you quoted seems to be speaking more of factory farming methods, not people actually going out and hunting for the food they need, so why do you then expand the critique to everyone who eats meat regardless of how if is sourced</text>

    <text>Yes that's more akin to murder than genocide; sometimes immoral things need to be done in order to survive. There's a difference between tribal hunting and factory farming</text>

    <text>So has your view stated in your initial post changed? It's fair to compare *some* carnists to nazis?</text>

    <text>There are also animals who kill other animals and don't eat them. Otters and dolphins kill and rape fish, foxes kill chickens and don't eat them, animals kill other animals who intrude on their territory.</text>

    <text>And when a human doesn’t know right from wrong, we put them in a mental hospital. Should we do the same for animals convicted of “murder”?</text>

    <text>If a human kills out of necessity, than they are not punished by the legal system usually. Humans are smarter than animals</text>

    <text>But if a human with a mental disability kills another person, they’re placed in a mental institution. A human with a severe mental disability may not know right from wrong, but we punish them anyway. Should we do the same for animals?</text>
