    <title>cmv: Canada should install dirty atomic bombs in each big lake as an invasion deterrent.</title>

    <original_post>With the upcoming climate changes and the fact that Canada has 20% of the freshwater reserve in the world. Russia, America, and other states might have an interest in invading Canada to access the water reserves and the Canadian north that will taw out and become available for crops.    
  

With this information, I believe that rigging the water table to be radioactive for eons in case of invasion would be the perfect deterrent to prevent the invasion from any other state.   

  

Especially America, as their water table would then also be contaminated</original_post>

    <text>The United States could easily cripple Canada with economic sanctions and would invade immediately before a nuclear threat could be on it borders. A nuclear dead man switch is a valid causa belli in eyes of most of the world as Canada would soon be deemed as rogue nuclear state. Potential nuclear threat on the United States border is more likely to result in the destruction of current Canadian state than not have one. If you want to see how far the US is willing to go to protect itself from nuclear threats see the Cuban Nuclear Crisis that almost ended the world.</text>
