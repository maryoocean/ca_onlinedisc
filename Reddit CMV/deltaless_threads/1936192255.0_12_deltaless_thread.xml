    <original_post>I'm sorry but as an artist and painter it grinds my gears when I see all these tik toks with artist wasting paint. I understand splatter painting to a degree. A few droplets aren't going to kill anybody but when it is just people throwing paint cans and it ect it's ridiculous. It's pretentious and honestly your not really making art. Your making just a mess and it's incredibly wasteful. 

In the age of environmental destruction paint is one of the worst and most toxic things you can emit into the world. There's been multiple articles and studies on how it facilitates climate change and all manner of other issues! If you're going to use a resource like paint use it efficiently!

If you don't you're kind of an ass.

Shit my link wasn't saved. What I mean by wast is this art trend https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRM7gN4y/?k=1</original_post>

    <text>What is wastetful to one person is master att to another.  Most kid paintings use way to much paint and don't look good, but to parents they are masterwork.

Really what is wasteful is is if too much money is being spent and that is a calculation that the painter makes.  So are you arguing that paint should cost more?

Also part of the art is the experience, or the tic tock, or the physics of it.  On what metric are you saying this trend should be judged on?</text>
