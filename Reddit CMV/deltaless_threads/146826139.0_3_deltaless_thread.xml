    <title>CMV: US Alcohol taxes should be higher.</title>
    <original_poster>huadpe</original_poster>
    <original_post>Currently alcohol taxes in the US are not very high.  I think given the social costs of drinking, particularly drunk driving and alcoholism, we would be better off raising them to better compensate for those costs, as a [pigouvian tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax).  We could lower other taxes to compensate, or not.  My view is not about the optimal level of overall taxation.

**The Numbers**

I'm going to just use hard liquor numbers because it's easier to get the tax rate per unit of ethanol.

Federally, a proof gallon is taxed [$13.50](http://www.ttb.gov/tax_audit/atftaxes.shtml), which equates to $27 per gallon of pure ethanol for human consumption.  At 0.6 fl oz per standard drink and 128 fl oz per gallon, that's about 12.6 cents per drink.  [State taxes](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=349) vary, but  on the whole bring it up to maybe 16 to 20 cents per drink.

[This study](http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797\(11\)00538-1/fulltext) ascribes a very high economic cost to alcohol consumption, and particularly to rapid consumption.  I don't know if their economic cost numbers are fully accurate, but it seems to support the hypothesis that there is a large cost, and that the cost comes in particular from people who consume a lot of alcohol.

So why shouldn't the total tax on alcohol go up to something like $100 per gallon of ethanol?

    <text>1) WHy are people who drink responsibly having to pay for those who aren't?  That's crazy logic. 

2) Using taxes to "manage" social behaviors, while effective, is morally questionable. Where do you or anyone else for that matter get the "authority" to tell me what I can and cannot do (beyond the scope of the law) and enforce your view by making it more expensive for me to engage in whatever behavior I desire (provided its legal... ie. I'm not hurting anyone else or putting them at risk). 

Here's the reality, governments raise "sin" taxes because they can. They know people will keep buying the product and keep paying the taxes. 

What's really the issue is that the gov pisses away the taxes they do collect on wars and dumb stuff, leading them to have to raise taxes on the general public. 

Raising taxes makes no sense, ever. Now if the government was spending tax payer money wisely, then it would be a discussion worth having. But as long as they continue to piss away trillions on bullshit, it sure isn't. </text>
