    <title>CMV: The bare minimum skill a politician should have is the ability to speak and form coherent sentences.</title>
    <original_poster>dancartopb</original_poster>
    <original_post>Politicians should be able to speak clearly and explain their ideas in a way that everyone can understand. It's important for them to communicate well so that people know what they're thinking and what they want to do.  
  
The best example is John Fetterman, anytime he speaks he makes no sense. A lot of arguments people have are that he just can't speak clearly but mentally he is the same. I'm not convinced of that but even if that were true I still don't think he should be in office. There have been multiple times when he tried to speak in Congress and nobody was able to understand him, that in turn wastes taxpayer money and time for other issues that can be hashed out and solved.  
  
Some people would say, well Joe Biden, or Donald Trump can't speak clearly, in my opinion thats a completely different thing, at the end of the day they can convey ideas, regurgitate a scripted speech, and talk and have regular conversations with people. Sometimes they both say things that make no sense but its not consistent and not all the time.  
  
John Fetterman on the otherhand has no ability to speak, convey ideas, or form coherent sentences, and thats why I think he should resign from office, or be forced out somehow.  
  
Ive thought about Stephen Hawking and yes he was a genius and unable to speak and thats the only semi convincing argument I can think of, and if John Fetterman was able to speak through a robot and rebuttal arguments and have conversations as well as Stephen Hawking was able to through a computer then id have no problem with that.  
  
I feel like people today are way to accepting where they would even argue for people with mental disorders such as people with down syndrome being in political office. And thats where we are headed to at this point.  
  
I'm open to hearing why someone would be against my view but the arguments ive already heard aren't convincing enough...</original_post>

    <text>A counter-example would be a mute politician - physically unable to speak, but capable of writing concise, elegant, meaningful prose.

Why should this person be barred from office?</text>

    <text>OP has already conceded text-to-speech, so would presumably concede someone reading a prepared (or extemporized) argument on behalf of the politican would be ok. 

If you had someone who demonstrated clear, lucid, powerful arguments and a full understanding of the issue *in print*, why would you not want them in office?</text>

    <text>I don't think you're going far enough, tbh. Politicians shouldn't be able to write. Too much chance of them being tricked into using TTS.

The whole thing would be a disaster for a politically literate nation, if they could use TTS, you're right.</text>

To communicate efficiently with other politicians, experts, aides, and bureaucrats. To efficiently answer questions posed by journalists.

    <text>"The human condition" does not mean "because human". The human condition changes all the time. It's how we live and behave in concurrent times. I also allowed for OP's situation if the structures allowing for the written word to be (if not the only way to communicate) the dominant way to communicate.</text>

This, to me, posits that humans are the recipients of emergent preferences and norms, but should not be empowered to introduce variance counter to those things.

Why?</text>

  <comment id="42977771959.0" user="Rodulv" delta="False">
    <text>I can only speculate as to why you think so. But this is not a correct reading. We introduce changes counter to the status quo all the time, that is part of the human condition.

OP's position that I disagreed with, and which was almost diametrically opposed to OOP's position, was that the written word is (if not more efficient), just as efficient as the spoken word, in every way. This is obviously not the case.</text>

    <text>&gt;I would say the majority of the job of a politician is being able to speak, if he or she is able to write amazing prose then they can work for a politician as a script or policy writer, etc.

It would make conversation and debate worse.

How can a politician engage in a debate, negotiation, or a public forum where immediate interaction and persuasion are key? To defend their positions and influence policy decisions in real time you would need to be able to speak, relying solely on just writing their words they wouldn't be able to actively participate in that.

By being physically unable to speak, the individual in question would be better suited for roles such as a script or policy writer, where their exceptional writing abilities can still contribute to the political process.

Life isn't fair and we shouldn't accommodate everyone for the sake of accommodating them.</text>

Do you think this fixation of the importance of immediacy might actually be a *bad* thing, generally speaking?

Basing policy on "immediate persuasion", say?</text>
