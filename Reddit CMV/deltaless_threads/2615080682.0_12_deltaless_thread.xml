    <title>CMV: Taylor Swift is the best artist of the 21st century and is on track to become the best artist of all time.</title>
    <original_poster>DesperateForYourDick</original_poster>
    <original_post>Note that here, ‚Äúbest‚Äù means most popular, most successful, most famous, etc. I am in no way saying that her music is the objective best music to listen to or anything like that.

Taylor Swift is a cultural phenomenon. Yes, her music is stereotypical ‚Äúbasic white girl music‚Äù (which is a problematic belief that many hold that I won‚Äôt get into here), but way too many people deny that she‚Äôs an all-time great just to be controversial, quirky, different, etc.

[Here is a quick list of her awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Taylor_Swift)

In addition to those, she has been on top of Billboard Artist 100 for **81 weeks**. She is the only artist to take up **every single spot** on the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time. She has multiple songs (Love Story, You Belong With Me, Shake it Off, We Are Never Getting Back Together) that have stood the test of time for a decade and will likely be classics at least on the level of songs like Hey Jude, or even We Will Rock You.

Furthermore, the Eras Tour is arguably already the most famous concert tour ever. Going by current numbers it will absolutely demolish the record for highest grossing concert tour, which was set by Elton John‚Äôs Farewell Yellow Brick Road. And it‚Äôll do so with just 1/3 the number of concerts.

Just look at the NFL. Their Twitter account changed their profile picture, bio, and banner just because Taylor Swift showed up to a Chiefs game. To have that level of influence over the most popular sports league in the United States is insane.

Yes, I‚Äôm a big fan of her work. But even objectively speaking, I don‚Äôt see how anyone can deny that, when she does retire, she will be one of the greatest artists to ever live, just in terms of objective popularity.

And just to directly address the claims made in my title‚ÄîI for one cannot name any artist with more name recognition in the 20th century. ‚ÄúTaylor Swift‚Äù is, at this point, used as the default name-drop for ‚Äústereotypically popular singer‚Äù. And her current level of popularity/fame is on par with any great artist (say, for example, the Beatles or Michael Jackson) at their peak, which is why I think she has a shot at becoming #1 all time.</original_post>

    <text>That‚Äôs fair. I probably should‚Äôve put more thought into my title; it seems to have misled most commenters so far.</text>

    <text>In my experience people on Reddit don‚Äôt ever read the full post before commenting so‚Ä¶yeah, your title‚Äôs the most important üòÖ</text>

    <text>OP did state in their text that they did not use the word best correctly and want to use a different definition. So Taylor Swift is the best is wrong even according to OP.</text>

    <text>The framing is relevant to call out. The disagreements in the comments are clearly people who don't like that "best" and "greatest" are being used as a shorthand for most popular when that's inappropriate. "Greatest" is in the body of the post and used repeatedly. These are relevant to OP's opinion.</text>
