    <title>CMV: Why isn't Wonder Woman sexist?</title>
    <original_poster>BottomOfTheNinth</original_poster>
    <original_post>Most of what I hear and see about Wonder Woman leads me to believe she's sexist. In the depictions I've seen of her she comes from a society that banished men, she seems to be surprised when men are good (and on the opposite side of things, surprised when women are evil) and generally can't go five minutes without calling men dicks because her dad was an asshole.

To clarify, this isn't some men's rights post. I don't care on some kind of personal level if she is or isn't sexist, I just kind of want it clarified for me because a lot of people say she isn't sexist - yet in the examples I've seen of her (the Justice League cartoon, the animated Wonder Woman film, the Flashpoint comic book series...) she pretty much just hates men in general. A lot of people have also told me that while Wonder Woman herself isn't sexist, the Amazons are, so I could kind of do with that being explained too.</original_post>

    <text>This is a huge storyline thread, and the answer depends on who's writing her.keep in mind that she's based off the Amazonian myth/tradition.she comes from a small paradise thats girls only, and ventures out to a more corrupt patriarchy. From her perspective, it'd be hard not to be sexist.

But over the years she's battled quite a few renegade amazons who wanted to kill all men.</text>
