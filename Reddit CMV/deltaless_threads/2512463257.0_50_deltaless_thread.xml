    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>Should students in a school be permitted to wear clothing that supports communism? Or LGBTQ rights? Or a political party?

If so, why should religion be treated worse than any other belief a person might hold? While I agree that the state shouldn’t promote religion, you’ve gone beyond neutrality and are actively using policy to exclude religious people.

School is not a mere privilege, but an obligation in modern society. Requiring students to attend a school, and then banning them from practicing their religion in any form while there is tantamount to banning religion from society. It is persecution.</text>
