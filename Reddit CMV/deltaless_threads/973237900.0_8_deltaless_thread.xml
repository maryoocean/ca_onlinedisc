    <title>CMV: It makes sense that police would be more violent on average than other people because the job naturally appeals to control freaks.</title>

    <original_post>(Disclaimer:This isn't an ACAB post. I think many cops are good people doing a job that society needs, and I'm not here to say that every cop is bad  or violent or that we should abolish police.)

A study in the 90s found that about 40% of cops were reported for domestic violence as opposed to 10% of the general population. I know that study is outdated, and may not be entirely accurate, but it makes sense that cops would be more violent on average than regular people because the job naturally appeals to control freaks.

The job largely entails enforcing rules, giving people orders that they have to obey, and physically coercing them if they don't comply. Even if the cop's order is unlawful, you're generally advised to obey anyway and take it to court later. If someone is naturally power-hungry, this is the kind of job that would appeal to them.

Again, I'm not saying every cop is bad or violent. I think their job is necessary and I think a lot of cops are good people, but the job itself  attracts control freaks.</original_post>

    <text>I think its the environment rather than personality traits. I believe people have the ability to change and so the constant input of a stressful and demanding job will definitely affect their mental state. I don't live in the US I'm from another country and the police here are very different. This, in my opinion, doesn't mean they are cut from different cloths (as in they are human just born in a different environment) and they have to perform the same task. It then, in my mind, must be the requirement of the job. 

Also, this is not taking into account the many other factors that lead to a person becoming a cop. It depends on location, age, payment and the risks you will confront. But a very interesting question!</text>
