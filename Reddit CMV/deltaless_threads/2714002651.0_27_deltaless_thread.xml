    <title>CMV: Capitalists hates the free market</title>
    <original_poster>SulemanDawood</original_poster>
    <original_post>Big businesses hat the idea of smaller companies rising up and challenging their market dominance which is why they try their absolute hardest to buy out every single startup they can. FAANG companies are notorious for this. They spend absurdly large sums of money which could be used to innovate on pointless mergers and acquisitions to avoid having to deal with the 'free' market. This is true even in the EU. The recent rise of Chinese EVs is driving european EVs out of the market and these companies are actively seeking to get them banned to save their own skins. Google, Amazon and Apple all continuously engage in anti-competitive practices to drive out competition because they can't deal with the fact that they can not innovate like smaller firms can. In the end capitalists are the ones destroying capitalism.</original_post>

    <text>The acquisition-culture in tech you described is the free market. A large corporation buying up smaller "competitors" doesn't mean they're against free-market -- it means they see some cost-benefit relationship in favor of making the acquisition and then go do so. Telling a company they shouldn't acquire a smaller company is the antithesis of what free market means: less (or no!) regulation, the strong survive and the weak are bought or bankrupted</text>
