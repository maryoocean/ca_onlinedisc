    <title>CMV: Christianity is held together through fear</title>
    <original_poster>M1STER_B0NES</original_poster>
    <original_post>My opinion is that if the fear of going to Hell was not present in the Christian ideology, then most of the followers of the religion would not be there.

Before I decided I was agnostic, that was my only reason for continuing to identify with the religion. Then, I decided I wasn't going to let fear control me. 

All in all, I don't see how this is any different than blackmailing a person to do what you want. You present your instruction, then tell them how you will completely devastate their life if they do not follow through.</original_post>

    <text>I for one am definitely not a Catholic because I am afraid of hell or oblivion. I am Catholic because my faith makes me a better person. My belief that an all-loving God exists and wants me to be the best person I can possibly be by emulating his son helps me get through the day and motivates me not to be a dumb and lazy senior in high school. It pushes me to do good in this world. Also, I believe most religion, especially mine, in its purest form makes the world a better place. The Catholic Church for example is one of the most legitimate and largest charities in the world; providing millions with various social service. In fact, I rarely think of possibly going to hell and instead focus on the "love thy neighbor" aspect and "God is all-loving". </text>
