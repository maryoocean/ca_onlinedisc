    <title>CMV: I'm wasting my time and money by going on vacation overseas.</title>
    <original_poster>beq451991</original_poster>
    <original_post>I am a somewhat recent college graduate and am about to take my first trip overseas, to Italy. I have a full-time job and am taking two weeks off for this trip. Now that the trip is coming up in a couple weeks, I am wondering why I thought it would be a good idea. I don't like the idea of two weeks of not being able to workout in a gym, eating decadent food, and spending as much money as I am on the trip. I am the stereotypical American who actually likes working and I try to work more hours than other people, punishing myself in the gym (if I'm not sore after lifting weights or out of breath after cardio, it's not a workout), and eating simple foods. I am going on this trip mainly for the historical aspect, but I am afraid of living too softly and enjoying myself too much, as ridiculous as that sounds. People tell me I'm going to work myself to an early death, but I see working as my purpose in life, as a man. I don't care if I drop dead from a heart attack at 40 if I worked as hard as I could and accomplished as much as possible.</original_post>

    <text>Listen; if you are not curious about what life has to offer then yeah why the hell would you ever do anything but what you are?  The thing is you ought to be curious.  You ought to try and grow your horizons, experience new things, throw yourself into unfamiliar situations.

Two weeks in Italy can be an absolutely wonderful experience (if you let it be).  You can eat some of the most amazing foods, see things that will amaze you, and actually slow down a bit and ask yourself the real questions of life.

Frankly Rome in particular is going to be an existentially challenging experience for you (and good).  There is a city, the most amazing city "accomplished" by generations of the world's smartest, strongest, hardest working people, reduced to rubble by time.  Enjoy!</text>
