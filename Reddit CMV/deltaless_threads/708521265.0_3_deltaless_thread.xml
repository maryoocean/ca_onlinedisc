    <title>CMV: Chromium should be the reference web browser implementation and maintained by an independent, non-profit organization.</title>
    <original_poster>vincentofearth</original_poster>
    <original_post>Warning: this is a bit technical and long-winded and you may not actually care.

&amp;lt;background&amp;gt;

The [web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) is built on a set of [standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_standards) that determine how web sites &amp;amp; apps are created, how they should be displayed, and how they should behave. Several organizations maintain and create these standards, like the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/), [Ecma International](https://www.ecma-international.org/default.htm), and many more (mostly with terrible websites).

The basic idea is that through these standards bodies, companies (Google, Microsoft, Apple), non-profits (Mozilla), and other internet stakeholders can come together and agree on some rules, recommendations, and conventions. Developers follow these standards when creating apps and websites. In turn, browsers agree to honor the standards. This is how you can create an app once and know that it's the same on all the latest browsers.

Except that last statement **isn't true**. Even a casual person on the web will know that [certain sites](https://twitter.com/AirbnbHelp/status/752829250198245376) just look weird on certain browsers. Weird bugs will pop up or some apps just don't work on browsers with a smaller market share. Some websites will even block specific browsers.

A lot of websites today are [built only for Chrome](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards), and Firefox/Edge/Safari users can count themselves lucky if, by sheer luck, a website also works on their obscure browser. Google Chrome's [dominance](http://gs.statcounter.com/) (63% market share) and [other](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/about) [factors](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdge/blob/master/README.md) mean that this will probably only grow worse in the future. Many [feel that this threatens](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/12/06/goodbye-edge/) the open standards that the web is built on, as Google builds its own set of standards and becomes the ultimate gatekeeper to our online lives.

Standards can never cover all the bases. Each [browser engine](https://gizmodo.com/which-browser-engine-powers-your-web-browsing-and-why-d-1833935288) implements standards [differently](https://caniuse.com/), with just enough minor differences to matter. They don't always do it at the same pace, their users don't update at the same pace, and they sometimes add features that aren't even standard yet. So developers are left to adapt--to patch the gaps and create workarounds, or (as more and more are doing) just give up and assume their users are using Chromium (Chrome's engine) or block those that aren't.

&amp;lt;/background&amp;gt;

Many feel that the solution is for more browsers--or actually, more browser *engines*, with a healthier market share for each (basically, *more competition*). This will force developers to build for the whole internet, not just for Chrome. I think this is a pipe dream at this point.

My position: there should be a **reference implementation** of a web browser that is actively maintained by a single independent, non-profit organization with members from many different stakeholders. Developers should test their sites on this reference. Actual browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) can add their own specific app features like a Download Manager, Extensions, Reading mode--anything that's not rendering the page. They can even deviate from the reference, but they must do so knowing that the reference stays the reference.

As things currently stand, the standards leave too much for browser vendors to decide. There are entire libraries devoted to solving the issue of incompatibility between browsers, and they haven't succeeded. This should not be the case. Competition is good, but it should be based on merit, not on how entrenched something is. As a user, I want to choose my browser based on its **features**, and I should just be able to assume that it can do the basic job of rendering a web page correctly, and (perhaps more important) consistently.

Edit: Added a final section I left out earlier, plus some additional clarification.</original_post>

    <text>So your solution solves one problem - vague specifications but not the other, arguably more pertinent problem - different browsers will implement things differently and will have different features because otherwise there's no point in having different browsers.

So lets take your scenario, chromium is forked and a 'standard' reference browser is created. Lets assume for sake of argument that Chrome still retains is dominant market share, and adds a cool feature - people visiting chrome can smell your site. Developers have three choices: 1. not use this new feature because it's not in the standard, 2. use this feature but provide graceful fallback for other browsers, or 3. use this feature as backbone to their app and not care about other browsers. That is the same choice they face today.

On the other end, lets take another browser - say Internet Voyager. It doesn't comply with most of the standard, its implementation maybe matched the standard from 5 years back but it hasn't been updated yet. A large portion of your userbase uses that browser, do you 1. not use features newer than 5 years even though its in the standard, 2. use them but provide graceful fallback for other browsers, or 3. use those features as backbone of your app and fine new customers?

There are obvious problems with all three options, and it is ultimately a trade off. Fundamental problem is in an ideal world* you'd have one browser (or rendering engine) that everyone uses but is updated frequently with security updates and features. Except of course that doesn't (and can't) exist.

*I lie, in an ideal world you'd take the job of rendering things out of hands of the Browser, and browser would just dumbly run code sent by the server which would render the page but that's even less likely to happen.</text>

    <text>In my ideal world, everyone would just follow along with the reference implementation (let's call this Chromium Prime). Chromium Prime going forward would not add a feature unless it was previously approved as a standard. It now becomes, in essence, the **manifestation** of the standard. Because of its market share, after a few years, other browser engines drop out of use almost entirely.

Now, I know that's a lot of *ifs*, but if all the major players are on board, I think it has a chance of happening. Developers still have to make the choice as you described, but it will be much easier. Option 1 is eliminated (if it's not in the standard, Chromium Prime wouldn't have it. As time goes on, option 2 will become less and less relevant, as the market share of Chromium Prime grows, which in turn makes option 3 more and more attractive. Again, this depends on a large market share maintained by Chromium Prime and good adoption of new updates.

As for supporting older browsers, they already do that now. Again, as Chromium Prime becomes more prevalent, the need for this diminishes.</text>
