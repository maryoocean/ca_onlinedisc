    <title>CMV: Human Life has no innate worth due to the Laws of Supply and Demand</title>

&amp;amp;nbsp;

So first I'd like to define the difference between Human Life and a Human Being. My premise rests on defining the two separately. Let me assure you that I feel that a Human Being with a developed consciousness is irreplaceable. However, due to the recent surge in discussions on abortion, I've been hammering out the details on a premise I'd like to present here in an effort to determine any flaws in it: **Human Life has no innate value, as there are over 7 billion humans on this planet, and the Laws of Supply and Demand dictate that an unborn child therefore only holds subjective worth.**


I noticed that many people seem to innately assume that unborn children are a highly valuable commodity, which confuses me, as any of 2-4 billion women could essentially produce billions more embryos at any given time. While a specific embryo or fetus can absolutely hold subjective value to a person, which is why I support laws that punish the murder of a pregnant person as though it was a double homicide, I don't see the issue with a person choosing to rid themselves of an unwanted pregnancy; nothing of inherent or subjective value was lost. While I'm not a fan of abortions used as matter of convenience (I'd much prefer universal healthcare and a robust Sex Ed curriculum), I see an abortion as nothing more than a medical procedure with no morality involved any more than a kidney transplant is "moral."

    <text>Supply and demand (which is not a law): the amount of a commodity, product, or service available and the desire of buyers for it, considered as factors regulating its price.

For the most part, are people for sale? Are humans a product, service or commodity?

No... so why are you trying to put these two together?


And there actually are people for sale. Humans who have no one to look for them or the means to are sold and abused. There are a demand for them. 

But regardless... my first point. Since people in mass are not being sold, why are you looking at it in that light. Two parents who feed, clothe, teach, raise &amp;amp; discipline a child have all the worth in the world to them.


An EMT or firefighter who break you out your mangled car after some drunk driver t-boned you and get you to the hospital have immense value to you at that time.</text>
