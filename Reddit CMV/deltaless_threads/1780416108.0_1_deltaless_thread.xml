    <title>CMV: The West does not understand Russia and its efforts to make it capitulate won't come into fruition</title>
    <original_poster>Tasogare80s</original_poster>
    <original_post>Russia and Russian politics in general is vastly different from the long-standing democratic societies of Western countries. The perception of western countries that Russia will ultimately capitulate due to economic pressures is presumptuous, primarily because it assumes that Russia operates on the same status quo that western countries do.

If and when a democratic country enters a war, public pressure and change in leadership ensures a war's end so long as the public deems it unworthy of continuation. Russia is a non-democratic society, to which the constraints of public opinion do not bind the Russian state to the opinions of its people due to it not caring about what the people think and its irrelevance to the decision-making process.

In some parts of Europe, parliaments have existed since the medieval ages, which eventually became our models for modern parliamentarianism and republican democracy. Russia never experienced these developments and hence from Tsardom to Soviet to the modern era, the public opinion of your average Russian is irrelevant. The only parliament that Russia ever had was the Zemsky Sobor, which only approved the line of succession for Tsars whose sole and only purpose and power was taken away by Tsar Peter I. This is important because Russian society did not experience the same thing that western democracies did, and hence assuming that they function in a similar way is flawed.

One important thing to note is that because of this, every time the Russian state and country underwent hardship they willingly outsourced their hardships on their people. Knowing full well that the people are incapable of rebellion and the nobility being so weak, as a result of their deprivation of rights and strengths to even affect anything. When Soviet Russia was undergoing economic hardship during the 20s Stalin blamed the kulaks. When Peter the Great went to war against Sweden, he incentivized nobles with tax breaks if they taxed their peasants effectively. I am willing to bet that Putin does not care about the average Russian pensioner and if shit hits the fan he will outsource the consequences of his war, to his people.

Additionally, when Stalin purged the kulaks, he also purged the Soviet military and politicians, replacing his power base anew. When Ivan the Terrible's power was being questioned by the nobility and boyars, he engaged in a political purge that executed most of the Russian aristocracy. Putin's support when he rose to power were former KGB agents and when he consolidated his power, he was backed by the oligarchs. There are now rumours that Putin has surrounded himself with right-wing ideologues like Alexandre Dugin and the military elite. The Russian nobility is interchangeable and they aren't cemented within the political system. Hence if the oligarchs feel that their profits are going dry due to sanctions, all Putin has to do is arrest them, shoot them or sack them to fall in line. 

If history tells us anything Russia is going to crackdown hard on its own people and engage in another political purge.</original_post>

Have your forgotten Afghanistan, or the collapse of the USSR? Wars aren't cheap, economic pressure can force you out no matter what the people want or think.

Why go back to Peter the great for examples when we see economic pressure destroying Russia as recently as the 1980s?</text>

    <text>Russia didn't only collapse because of economic pressures, it was a mix of that, social and political pressures which pushed Russia to the brink. Even then, it only took a couple years before Yeltsin's government was replaced by Putin. Russia didn't totally collapse contrary to popular belief.

Though I may be wrong and this really is the collapse of Russia as a nation-state, as for now, I'm inclined to say I disagree.

It's called historical institutionalism in political science. The context of your political history and the institutions the country grew up with matters to understand the present. It's relevant because most of the time, new regimes are only modern iterations of age old power structures to fit current circumstances.</text>

    <text>What happens when the Russian people get cut off from the world due to sanctions? Social and political pressure gets applied to the leaders.</text>

And that's not exactly what is happening now? The economy is collapsing, they are a pariah state, there are anti-war protests in every major city and on state run TV, millions are about to be unemployed and international travel and foreign goods are about to be relics of the past.

Yeah, most of the people in Russia's government where alive when the Afghan war failed, and the USSR collapsed. Russia has a history of falling for sunk cost fallacies, until is blow up in their face.</text>

It is too soon to tell. I guess we can only really tell if the Putin regime actually gets ousted in the coming months. Other countries have suffered worse economic recessions and sanctions and bounced back.

Pretty sure we can lump all other great powers together on this and yet, they still do the same things. I'm pretty sure the Russian government is incompetent, but not incompetent enough to willingly topple their own regime. Unless I'm wrong.</text>

It won't the the Russian government that topples the regime. It will be the Russian people. Probably an oligarch will assassinate Putin.</text>

    <text>I don’t think the collapse of Russia is the goal of the west here though. Of course no one would be sad if Putin lost power, but the wests goal right now is to end the invasion of Ukraine and probably to deter future Russian aggression. 

I think we all know that there’s not going to be some election where the people throw out Putin and this is all over. But the point is to make the war too costly to Putin. If he is bogged down militarily in Ukraine, using force to suppress unrest at home over empty shelves, and running out of favors to keep his cronies happy then continuing the war will not be worth it.</text>

Those definitely were factors but the fall of the Soviet Union weren't because of that. Especially when they were sanctioned for most of their existence and ironically once they liberalised, is when they started to crumble.</text>
