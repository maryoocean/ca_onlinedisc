    <title>Women are the inferior gender : CMV</title>
    <original_poster>Lanayru</original_poster>
    <original_post>I know this CMV has been done before (I searched before making this particular submission), but I believe the circumstances in which my sexism has grown are different enough from the other OPs of other similar threads (like user TyKillsTyGoT) to make a new topic that suits my reality better.

I share many of the views held by this user, such as:

    "The smartest people are men. The strongest people are men. It seems like women are average while men can excel or fail spectacularly."

    "I really want to be able to look at women as people but whenever I see a pretty woman in a nice car, I automatically assume someone bought it for her. When I see a woman out shopping, I wonder what her spouse does to afford her these privileges. "

    "The women in my life seem to support this hypothesis. I know some girls who are very smart, but they're not on the level of the smartest guys I know. I also know some girls who are very physically fit but once again they cant compare to the fit men I know and research agrees with both of these points. "

They all pretty much sum up the most prevailing sexist ideas I have.

Now, I should clarify and explain why my reality is different from that of TyKillsTyGoT. I've lived all of my life in a very sexist country, (I'm not from the US, and although I'm sure they have their own issues with sexism, it is, by far, a lot less severe than that which my country has held with such determination) and my parents, siblings and other people close to me have been raised with a sexist ideology. This ideology can vary from the pettiest, smallest things like the situations I listed above, to more serious and aggressive behaviors such as a generalized violence against women in households, or forcing women to stay at home raising kids with no opportunity from their partners to seek financial independence.

I do not share or condone in any way, shape or form the latter. However, I do share a vast majority of the former, and they make me feel really immature, since I know those views aren't objectively true, and are nothing but product of generalization and blunt sexism. In all due honesty, most of the women in this country are not really doing much to change my ideas (I'm not saying that they have to, but rather that their behaviors reinforce all those sexist stereotypes, inevitably so, as we've all been raised inside a sexist nation), by either fitting the stereotypes almost perfectly or using their gender as a mean to get benefits or escape certain situations (such as the "chivarly" most, if not all, of them demand. Personally I think chivarly is based on the idea that women are weaker, and therefore a man must do the hard job for them).

I really want to open my mind and change the view this country has force-fed me with since childhood, so please reddit, CMV.

    <text>Even though we have sophisticated technologies and ideas today, do not forget that it is extremely recent in the history of the human species.  Our biology and social structures maximized survival and everything that entails.  Women have to commit an enormous amount of resources to birth a child, while men commit an extremely small fraction in comparison.  This means that a society that protects their women will continue, thus since powerful (or deceptive, etc.) have greater chances of producing more offspring then the rest while women are much more limited.  So men protect women and the society has a better chance at survival.  Viola.

Now, "you can't get an aught from an is" so just because this survived doesn't mean it is the best way to do so.  It may be all people are familiar with so they think it's a superior method.  Yet when other methods are introduced such as allowing women to enter the workforce, women do and it does increase the economic power of a state.  The same applies to science, technology, art, literature, etc., the problem you are seeing is that it hasn't been that way for the vast majority of history, with a few exceptions.

Let's look at the views you share:
&amp;gt;"The smartest people are men. The strongest people are men. It seems like women are average while men can excel or fail spectacularly."

Take it to be true, those men aren't you or people you know, nor are you the strongest.  Does that make you a inferior male?  If you feel as such then they would simply tell you that is nonsense, if you don't then intelligence nor strength has any bearing on superiority.  Also a society that constrains women shouldn't be amazed when they don't succeed or fail.

&amp;gt;"I really want to be able to look at women as people but whenever I see a pretty woman in a nice car, I automatically assume someone bought it for her. When I see a woman out shopping, I wonder what her spouse does to afford her these privileges. "

Ditto above since a society that constrains women financially can't also then expect them to have finances as men do.

&amp;gt;"The women in my life seem to support this hypothesis..."

So you are agreeing in that societal influences actually influence perception and actions of others and then using that massive bias as evidence?

&amp;gt;...using their gender as a mean to get benefits or escape certain situations..

Wouldn't this be a particularly intelligent strategy?
