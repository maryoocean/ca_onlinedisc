    <title>CMV: Fredom of speech is far more important than a few people being offended</title>
    <original_poster>brbrWh0r3</original_poster>
    <original_post>Freedom of speech should be protected and kept, there shouldn't be people arrested for anti trans comments or insulting a soldier/soldiers, or for nazi jokes, or racist remarks or jokes.

Those should all be handled between people, if someone says stuff you dont like you handle it, simply block them or avoid them, theres a whole world you can be in and that persons in a very tiny part of it. 

It makes me nervous seeing people arrested and charged for saying things. It's only leading us to a place where we can be arrested for saying whatever the government doesnt like. And they shouldn't be in that much power to effect our communication with eachother. 

I live in scotland and dont feel I have freedom of speech anymore. 

(For the record I'm a white woman who's bi and have trans thoughts ig for those folks who say it never has been about me, it has sometimes, and in more ways than just those)

Edit: No it's not just anti trans people, Yes I believe crimes other than hate crimes involving speech should be illegal (threatening violence, doxing, defamation) but I also believe insults, jokes and bad takes or thoughts should not be.

Edit 2: Consequences for what is said like losing a job, getting insulted, losing friends ect is totally fine I just dont think the Government should be in charge of what can get you arrested in this sence.

Edit 3: I live in SCOTLAND in the UNITED KINGDOM or in BRITAIN depending what you say, I'm not american, im also not here advocating for my right to be a dick, im just saying the government arent the ones I want saying what I cant say, I mean twitter can destroy lives without them anyway.</original_post>

    <text>I don't mind what anyone says really. Sticks and stones will break my bones but names will never hurt me. Take the good with the bad. There will always be thugs out there. Eventually, people will see them for what they are. We are a hyper-reactive and hyper-sensitive society now. Kind of wimp like in some regards fearful and up in arms over the smallest of things.  
I fear all the tyrants/dictators/narcissists running the roost now.   
 Corporations will eventually die if they become full of collusion/corruption/contempt/complacency etc... I used to work for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldCom\_scandal that company could manipulate the masses so easily without question cause no one questioned it.  
I fear this now a days: https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/556160-media-spread-fear-americans-listen?rl=1 https://securitypolicylaw.syr.edu/fear-a-dictators-tool/ https://www.anxiety.org/psychology-of-dictators-power-fear-anxiety  
as giants run the roost it seems:

I fear the great influence they have for media is the message to the masses and when the masses don't question much anymore as the norm that I fear. For much power/control they can have. Corporations eventually die unless they are a monopoly. And governments hardly ever die. A problem.

for if a tyrant/dictator/narcissist gets at the helm of that ship, they will destroy others for their own gain/power/control/fame/fortune financially (debt trap https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap\_diplomacy), legally (limit FREEDOMS/rights/privacy), physically (use of force) and or emotionally (gas lighting, blame/shame, guilt, cognitive dissonance etc.. https://thenarcissisticlife.com/games-narcissists-play/ https://abusewarrior.com/toxic-relationships/narcissistic-abuse/manipulation-tactics/ )  
That I fear.</text>
