    <title>CMV: Advocacy should be priorized over Objectivity in the Free press</title>
    <original_poster>anonymous68856775</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have heard many people talking about how the job of the press is to remain objective, giving the truth to let the citizens decide for themselves what to believe. However, I believe the opposite. 

First of all, I define Advocacy as a genre of journalism that combines reporting with a point of view, allowing for the writer to express their opinion. Objective reporting is trying to report on facts without distortion.

One of the major purposes of a free press is to be able to articulate criticism is to utilize that power to hold democratic powers accountable. In order for a democracy to function effectively, the ability and persistence of criticism is absolutely necessary. Therefore, the press has a duty not simply to inform, but to take a stance on given issues, allowing Amercians to be exposed to a myriad of opinions, and hold their government accountable. 

Prioritizing advocacy in media reporting and journalism plays a crucial role in protecting human rights by giving a voice to those being harmed and also alerts the audience to injustices. Advocacy transforms a reporter from a mere communicator of information into a motivator for action, allowing for human rights to be upheld. 

An example can be seen in early America. Columbia Journalism review [explains](https://archives.cjr.org/feature/rethinking_objectivity.php) that in the attempt to be objective about lynchings, news sources would cover the murder of a man by the mob, and also cover the reason for the mob’s murder. They wouldn’t mention that lynching was immoral, they simply gave reasons for and against. They then go even further, citing a book on objectivity in the press, “Mindich shows how “objective” coverage of lynching in the 1890s by The New York Times and other papers created a false balance on the issue and failed “to recognize a truth, that African-Americans were being terrorized across the nation.

Objectivity can only tell us what is happening - Advocacy lobbies to fix the issue. If someone is stealing a car, merely observing that fact is not enough. Advocacy is crucial to change.

I wonder if there is something wrong in my logic somewhere, or if there is some benefit of objectivity that haven't found yet.

    <text>A few things:

The concept of free press is not for media companies. It's for citizens to voice their opinions in the public sphere for many, if not all, of the reasons you've stated are benefits of a *free press*. 

Objectivity in the case that you've cited regarding lynching aupposed

&gt;An example can be seen in early America. Columbia Journalism review explains that in the attempt to be objective about lynchings, news sources would cover the murder of a man by the mob and also cover the reason for the mob’s murder. They wouldn’t mention that lynching was immoral. They simply gave reasons for and against....

&gt;....papers created a false balance on the issue and failed* “to recognize a truth*, that African-Americans were being terrorized across the nation.


That may be the case, but notice: The clear-cut objectivity allows viewers to make their own decisions, having all the pieces *untainted* with bias. Which, in turn, allows one to advocate from an assured position if they alone felt the need to do so. Therein come the free press rights, to be able to go out and advocate. 

The problem with advocacy in media is that it robs the viewers of that opportunity to genuinely advocate from a real place internally. In this case, the media is making that decision for the viewer. Media should deliver the barebone facts, objectively... then reserve a segment for *"now... here's what I think about that. "*</text>
