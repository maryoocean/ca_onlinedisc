    <title>I think reddit has misinterpreted the purpose of the White House petition website. CMV.</title>
    <original_poster>feartrich</original_poster>
    <original_post>The purpose of the "We the People" website is so the federal government can keep tabs on what people are concerned about. Modeled after similar sites like those that governments in the EU have set up, it's a new way for citizens to interact with the government and vice versa. It's an easy way for the executive branch to keep track of the zeitgeist without using too much in the way of PR resources.

The purpose of the website is so you can voice your concerns. If there's enough attention given by users to one concern, then someone will listen and respond. That's it. The White House has *never* indicated that any of these petitions would affect real policy. Never.

In fact, it's not that far from petitions have traditionally worked. Civil petitions are just a formal request and show of solidarity; on their own, they are rarely effective at directly influencing policy.

So in that sense, the "We the People" website is far from the farce that /r/worldnews or /r/politics proclaims it to be.

    <text>For what? There's no history of people being arrested simply because they filled out an online form to voice support for something.</text>

    <text>But again, for what? To target people because they hold an opinion? And then what? 

You think PRISM is some sort of Statsi/NK shit. It's clearly not that at all. Do some research. 

The government has been known to keep track of prominent individuals that aren't ideologically aligned with the government. But average Joes signing a petition to free Edward Snowden etc? What would they gain from that? Practically nothing.</text>

    <text>The proposal to *reduce* PRISM is that they will only watch people with two degrees of phone call separation from the watch list.

So take a couple hundred thousand people for the terrorist watch list, now add in every single person who  has ever called or been called by somebody on that list.  Now add in every single person who has ever called or been called by the expanded list.  That is going to be a *massive* number of people.   Right now they are admitting they track even more people than that.

The idea that they use the petitions to name people to track is silly not because they don't want to track hundreds of thousands of people for trivial reasons, but because the dragnet encompasses so many people already that it would be redundant.</text>

    <text>I'm not disputing the reach of PRISM. The thing is that Remping thinks that the NSA is collecting a list of a political adversaries from these petitions. That's clearly not going on.</text>
