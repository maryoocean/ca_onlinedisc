    <title>CMV: A rationing system not unlike what Britain had during WW2 would be beneficial for the US.</title>

    <original_post>In the aftermath of WW1 Britain looked at their rationing system during the war, and concluded that there was... lots of work that could be done. During WW2, they had a whole section of their government basically devoted to making sure that, damn the U-Boats and the Blitz, they were going to keep everyone fed. This also caused a bit of a dietary shift, but as a result of the rationing it should be noted that *food quality increased* and life expectancy (when it wasn't truncated by bombings and long-range rocket strikes) actually went up on average. Admittedly, this came a the price of making food not too terribly exciting (thus mock duck and mock chicken) which to be fair probably discouraged overeating.  


Given the current tendency for cheap food to also be incredibly fattening food, a shift to a rationing system that ensured everyone had access to fresh veggies and also limited the intake of any one person's would result in an upward trend in general US health. Though, since we're not in a "enemy nation flying bomber runs over our cities and sinking our transport ships" situation at the moment there is no need for it to be so stringent.</original_post>

    <text>I'm not entirely certain what you're getting at to be honest, but the cost of micromanaging everyones food intake sounds way too expensive to be effective
