    <title>CMV: I believe that abortion as a result of consensual sex (without contraception) is wrong.</title>
    <original_poster>BreakinMyBallz</original_poster>
    <original_post>I feel as though women who choose to have sex without the means of contraception, simply don't care if they get pregnant. They put their pleasures over the risk of having a child and having it terminated. 

I feel as though, when the sperm and egg mix, they create a completely new set of DNA, DNA that has never been the same in the entire history of our species and is a completely unique person (I'm not Theist, I try to base my arguments on the uniqueness of each person)

I don't see any way for someone to justify abortion when it is the result of sex without contraception. That woman simply did not care that new life was created within her, and chose to have sex in the first place. We argue it's a woman's choice for abortion? No, It's a woman's choice to have sex without the means of contraception.

-------
Clarification - I believe contraception is OK because new life with unique DNA and a unique person has not been formed and therefore will not be removed from the world.</original_post>

    <text>I'm gonna have to read up on sex some more. I had no idea consensual sex could induce abortion.

As usual, this thread is yet another boy/man with their incredibly thought-out opinion on abortion that doesn't consider *the woman carrying the embryo/fetus* at all. I think your analysis is missing a little teeny tiny detail.

Edit: But, I'll play. Your position is ridiculous because:

- People are told they are infertile and get pregnant.

- People use contraception and get pregnant. In your not-very-well-thought-out position, abortion is bad because DNA and new human. How is this different if the couple was using contraception?

- Conception sometimes results in identical twins or triplets. Is it then okay to abort one of them, because the DNA is 100% the same?

- The pregnant person's partner may have lied about using contraception. 

- People  get pregnant with unviable progeny that will die in or just out of the womb. Being forced to carry a stillborn dead fetus until it delivers naturally can be, and has been, very dangerous to the pregnant person's health. Forcing a person to carry an unviable mutation to term, deliver it, and watch it die is usually considered cruel.

- People get raped and get pregnant from it.

- Children get raped and get pregnant from it.

Also, given the preponderance of talk like 

- "They put their pleasures over the risk of having a child," 

- "simply don't care if they get pregnant," 

- "chose to have sex in the first place"

I'm slightly inclined to tag you as "Thinks women are stupid slutty whores."</text>
