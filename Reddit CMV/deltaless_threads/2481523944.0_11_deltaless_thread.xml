    <title>cmv: Canada should install dirty atomic bombs in each big lake as an invasion deterrent.</title>
    <original_poster>maxi1134</original_poster>
    <original_post>With the upcoming climate changes and the fact that Canada has 20% of the freshwater reserve in the world. Russia, America, and other states might have an interest in invading Canada to access the water reserves and the Canadian north that will taw out and become available for crops.    
  

With this information, I believe that rigging the water table to be radioactive for eons in case of invasion would be the perfect deterrent to prevent the invasion from any other state.   

  

Especially America, as their water table would then also be contaminated</original_post>

    <text>I am pretty sure this would be a war crime.

Canada is large and sparsely populated.  Any invading force would simply move further north to smaller (but plentiful) lakes.

And even if all of those lakes were contaminated, the invading force would continue north and start harvesting arctic ice and truck it back south.</text>

    <text>If we were in a drought scenario bad enough to warrant invasion. The Artic would be melted since a while</text>
