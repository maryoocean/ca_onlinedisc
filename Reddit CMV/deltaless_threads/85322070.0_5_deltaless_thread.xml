    <original_post>With the advance in technology that the Europeans brought with them the Aboriginal way of life became out dated and the Aboriginals that embraced it were well off eg Bennelong.</original_post>

    <text>White Europeans killed millions of Aboriginal people from disease of violence, they deceived them on some cases and just murdered them on the others. Fast forward to today and things like illiteracy and alcoholism is way higher in aboriginal communities. 

Technology doesn't really benefit people that much, aborigines were happy people before white people came. Now almost every social issue that exists is present in aboriginal communities.</text>
