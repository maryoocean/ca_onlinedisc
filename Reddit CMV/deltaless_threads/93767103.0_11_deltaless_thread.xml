    <title>I believe humans need their rights limited to ensure survival of our species. CMV.</title>

    <original_post>This is something I've believed for a while. As a species, humans are self-destructive. We procreate too much and consume too many resources. I believe that something like China's one-child policy should be instituted in as many countries as possible to curb population growth. ~~I think currency should be done away with and governments should provide housing and necessities while the population works for the betterment and survival of humanity as a whole rather than for monetary compensation.~~

Am I crazy to think this is how the world should be? 

EDIT: Perhaps eliminating currency would be more problematic than keeping it.</original_post>

    <text>- When there were only 1000 people living, we had almost no technology. You had to hunt &amp;amp; forage to survive.
- When there were 10,000 people, there was enough excess from hunting &amp;amp; gathering that tribes could take care of their sick.
- When there were 100,000 people, some could spend their time planting seed while others hunted.
- When there were 1,000,000 people some could work on innovations (tools, beer, etc.).
- When there was 1,000,000 we could have infrastructure to build basic communications networks, large scale produciton of lots of stuff (making materials goods affordable), get places faster, cure lots of diseases, and share ideas.

You can't support a Smithsonian museum in a society with only 500 people. History has shown that the more people we have, the lower the percentage of those who go hungry. We need more people -- more people mean more arts, more museums, more communications, more innovation. **Reddit could never have existed in a world of only 5,000 people**. What cool stuff would we be denying ourselves if we stopped growing now?</text>
