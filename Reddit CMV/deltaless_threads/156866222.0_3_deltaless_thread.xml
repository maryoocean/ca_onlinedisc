    <title>CMV:I believe torture to be perfectly ok if guilt is established beyond reasonable doubt.</title>
    <original_poster>Disgustingoldslob</original_poster>
    <original_post>Simple as the title, I believe that if someone is guilty of a serious crime against another (rape, murder, child abuse, etcetc) the victim or the family of the victim should be legally allowed to torture the guilty party as part of the punishment. I do not believe doing so lowers you to the level of the guilty, as you would be acting out violence on someone who harmed an innocent, while they were completely unjustified in their actions. I also do not believe the moral objections of others should interfere with the legal right of the family/victim.

Edit for clarification, I don't believe it should be mandatory, but I believe it should be an available option. I'm speaking of cases in which guilt is almost perfectly assured. (e.g sound witness testimony, DNA, caught in the act, admission of guilt, etc.)

    <text>Well the proverb for this is "An eye for an eye leaves everyone blind". There are questions about the thoroughness of legal systems, basically no matter what, people will slip through the cracks (check out Texas' controversial executions). Reasonable doubt is a good threshold for imprisonment, which is not permanent, unlike execution or torture (trauma, injuries etc). I'm also going out on a limb here, but I think most psychologists would agree that it would not help the family/victim move on, and most probably only add to their suffering.   </text>
