    <original_post>Homosexuality is not natural, and neither is heterosexuality

There is no such thing as attraction in other mammal species, just the male raping the female and reproducing. 

Attraction in humans is a social construct. It's a way to soothe people or to bond similar to how bonobos do it.

Because us humans have “the instinctive need to produce offspring,” the sheer fact that men want to have PiV sex with women just for fun or without wanting kids, proves it's not a natural attraction.

Plus, most women don't care about being penetrated. It doesn't feel good for us, clitoral stimulation is a need for most. PiV sex has no purpose outside of getting pregnant. Sexual relationships are not necessary at all.</original_post>

    <text>Clarifying question; OP are you by any chance asexual? Of possibly the sex repullsed variety? There is a list on r/asexual about signs that you might be asexual if [you want to look at it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Asexual/wiki/questioning)</text>

    <text>In the case; have you considered that sexual attraction is natural but the people when hsing that term are referring to something that you as an asecual person may not experience at the same intensity as them?

For example I have autism meaning sometimes I fail to pick up on social cues, many of those cues though could be argued to be natural things that other people experience.</text>

    <text>I think you're projecting your asexuality onto non-human species. This assertion that other animals are only interested in reproduction, without also experiencing attraction *as an adaptive mechanism to promote reproduction,* is pulled out of thin air. Are you encountering others who are calling your asexuality unnatural?</text>
