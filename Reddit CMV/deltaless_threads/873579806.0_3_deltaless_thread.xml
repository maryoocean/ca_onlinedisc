    <title>CMV: Skwovet is just British Bidoof</title>
    <original_poster>ShaddowFox</original_poster>
    <original_post>I mean, just look at this damn thing. It's all poofy and useless. It's like Bidoof just stood on two feet and poofed it's tail. It's everywhere, like tree herpes. And all it does is get in the way and steal my berries. You know who else always showed up to ruin my good time? **Bidoof**, that's right! I bet you can also guess what gangster is rolling the same typing with a similar stat spread? ^Bidoof. Skwovet is terrible. You know who has the same dentist as Bidoof? I mean, it's Greedent... but it still counts!</original_post>

    <text>Bidoof is far more prolific and actually far useful in the games it was introduced in. So no, and donâ€™t insult our overlord bidoof with such a laughable comparison, it is downright insulting</text>

    <text>To add on to why exactly Bidoof is useful. New Pokemon players may not remember the days of HM's, but us old players remember keeping these useless Pokemon just to get around. Bidoof was a fantastic HM slave in the 4th gen. I think it could learn every HM except Fly, which was an incredibly useful thing to have. Our lord Bidoof singlehandedly saved us from the horrors of teaching starter pokemon rock smash. While Skwovet is a useless fat pile of shit with teeth.</text>

    <text>This is true, but with HMs on their way out, Bidoof's usefulness has left with them. Now, all my love and attention goes to the swiss army bike. Your lord has left us! This is indicated by Dracovish being a thing that miserably exists.</text>
