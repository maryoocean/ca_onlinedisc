    <title>CMV: Some cultural traditions don't deserve respect and outsiders should actively make an attempt to change them.</title>

I came across this video today, in which brides in a certain culture are kidnapped of the streets and are physically held and forced into marriage by their family (sometimes even just their distant extended family). In many cultures there are many flaws but almost all modern societies don't condone the forced kidnap and eventual rape of women. This culture will continue to cause real tangible and direct harm to individuals unless it is somehow changed from external pressure. This tradition doesn't deserve to be respected and deserves active attempts to destroy it by well meaning outsiders. I am trying to see if there is any argument behind the common view of "we must respect all cultures". I don't see how or why a culture that deprives people of fundamental human rights deserves respect, and how it is not the duty of outsiders to try to stop them. Change my view </original_post>

    <text>Not always but in Mongolian culture you generally discuss it before hand and so that she is aware of when and how it will take place. I think you should learn more about it before telling a culture to change their ways especially when there is parts you are unaware of.</text>

    <text>Again that does happen.. BUT the majority are much more traditional and there is already a heavy movement to ban the practice.</text>
