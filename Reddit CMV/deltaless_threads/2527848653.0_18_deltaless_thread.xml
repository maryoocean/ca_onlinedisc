    <title>CMV: Advocacy should be priorized over Objectivity in the Free press</title>
    <original_poster>anonymous68856775</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have heard many people talking about how the job of the press is to remain objective, giving the truth to let the citizens decide for themselves what to believe. However, I believe the opposite. 

First of all, I define Advocacy as a genre of journalism that combines reporting with a point of view, allowing for the writer to express their opinion. Objective reporting is trying to report on facts without distortion.

One of the major purposes of a free press is to be able to articulate criticism is to utilize that power to hold democratic powers accountable. In order for a democracy to function effectively, the ability and persistence of criticism is absolutely necessary. Therefore, the press has a duty not simply to inform, but to take a stance on given issues, allowing Amercians to be exposed to a myriad of opinions, and hold their government accountable. 

Prioritizing advocacy in media reporting and journalism plays a crucial role in protecting human rights by giving a voice to those being harmed and also alerts the audience to injustices. Advocacy transforms a reporter from a mere communicator of information into a motivator for action, allowing for human rights to be upheld. 

An example can be seen in early America. Columbia Journalism review [explains](https://archives.cjr.org/feature/rethinking_objectivity.php) that in the attempt to be objective about lynchings, news sources would cover the murder of a man by the mob, and also cover the reason for the mob’s murder. They wouldn’t mention that lynching was immoral, they simply gave reasons for and against. They then go even further, citing a book on objectivity in the press, “Mindich shows how “objective” coverage of lynching in the 1890s by The New York Times and other papers created a false balance on the issue and failed “to recognize a truth, that African-Americans were being terrorized across the nation.

Objectivity can only tell us what is happening - Advocacy lobbies to fix the issue. If someone is stealing a car, merely observing that fact is not enough. Advocacy is crucial to change.

I wonder if there is something wrong in my logic somewhere, or if there is some benefit of objectivity that haven't found yet.

    <text>Where to begin... What you are calling advocacy journalism is simply editorializing. It has existed since the beginning of the free press. By name, it was a style of journalism reserved for seasoned, trusted reporters who had earned the right. Only in the last few decades has it become the most common form of journalism. That happened for a few different reasons. First, the younger writers simply wanted the prize without actually earning it. Second, fewer and fewer journalists actually went to J School because the medium had become increasingly visual. This meant an attractive face with a communications degree was hired over an average person with a degree in journalism. And, of course, the pretty people were all offended by the idea that their uneducated and inexperienced opinion had lesser value.  Everyone wanted to editorialize. 

You then ramble on about advocacy protecting human rights. Nonsense. Utter nonsense. This brand of journalism preaches to the choir. Why? Because when you deal in opinions and not facts people only believe you if you are telling them what the already want to believe. Jesus Christ, look at how low the credibility numbers are for the clowns at CNN, Fox, MSNBC etc. Even the people watching those idiots are smart enough to understand that they are being jerked off.

One last thing advocacy journalism has a nasty habit of leaving out details that do not agree with their narrative. Or ignoring stories altogether. They even turn on one another if someone dares to break ranks. It is crazy and misleading and I promise you it hurts everyone in the long run. If news is politicized then there is no bridge between the left and right. The left just drifts further left and the right drifts further right because both are being spoon feed by advocates.</text>
