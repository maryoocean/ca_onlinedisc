    <title>CMV: It is illogical to not believe in Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>LAMARR__44</original_poster>
    <original_post>Many people either believe in Hard Determinism or Compatibilism. I will argue that both are illogical.

Both argue that human actions are extensions of factors we do not have a choice over. Compatibilism seems to say we are still free but just redefines free will to the internal factors behind a decision, but the decision is still decided by a chain of events outside of our control.

My argument is a sort of wager argument. Either libertarian free will exists or it doesn’t. If it exists and we believe in it, we have made a free decision where we are right. If libertarian free will doesn’t exist, the decision to believe in libertarian free will was out of our control.

So either we have a choice and we can make the right choice, or we don’t have a choice and were determined to be wrong.

Thus it makes more sense to believe in libertarian free will since it’s potentially the only one where we have a chance to make a right choice, if determinism is true there is no choice, so there’s no value in being right.</original_post>

    <text>Sensory experiences that seems like subjective experience are objectively defined by the arrangement of atoms in our brain at any given time. Why do you believe that consciousness is not physical? It seems like you are looking for a fig leaf for consciousness to hide behind when none is needed.  


Consciousness is not some magical thing. There have been experiments that show that thoughts come after the action that proceed it. There are other experiments where people feel in control of events they have no control over. The conscious brain is just a very quick story teller and because it is so quick it gives us the illusion of free will.   


I would rephrase your initial arguement slightly.   


Thus it makes more sense to believe in libertarian free will since it’s potentially the only one where we have a chance to make a right choice  


Thus it makes more sense to ***discuss*** libertarian free will since it’s potentially the only one where we have a chance to make a right choice.   


I agree discussion is moot in all other cases since the logical conclusions for all other cases are well defined, but it does NOT follow that it "makes sense to discuss" equals it "makes sense to believe" that in fact is illogical.</text>

    <text>There is a big explanatory gap. How does, “when someone has this subjective experience there is this configuration of atoms in their brain” explain why there is the subjective experience in the first place? Is simply equating correlation with causation.</text>

    <text>I don't think anyone, myself included, is attempting to explain the question why are things the way they are.

What I am saying is things are this way and there is evidence to that effect. Correlation and/or causation have nothing to do with it.

I am also saying that you are using the word belief where the word discuss would make more sense.</text>
