    <title>People should not break up fights unless one of the fighters explicitly states that they don't want to be fighting. CMV</title>

    <original_post>This has always been a major peeve of mine. I like watching random people fight, and I've been in a few myself. Every time there's a fight, some asshole decides to be a hero and try to break it up. Back in high school, these two kids pulled us apart even though we both explicitly stated that we wanted to fight. Now, I understand why a teacher, cop, or bouncer would do it, nothing against them, but if you're not an authority figure or at risk of injury or property damage yourself, you should let the people fight. For example, if you form a fight ring in high school around the two combatants, then no one is getting hurt, and nor is anyone not involved in the fight getting injured. In that case, no one should intervene unless an authority figure arrives. 

Now of course, there are exceptions. For example, if one person clearly does not want to be in the fight, then someone should break it up. For example, they may be asking for help or just being pummeled without throwing any punches themselves. Or if you witnessed the fight from the very beginning and one guy clearly just attacked the other without provocation. Then you should break up the fight. 

Otherwise, two adults should be allowed to fight and no one should intervene until one of them either states that he does not want to fight anymore, or is put into a state into which he cannot express this desire. Otherwise, people should just enjoy the show and mind their own fucking business.

    <text>What happens if you come across a fight already in progress? It seems to me that it is a good default rule to attempt to stop people harming one another if you can.

However, I do agree that if two people explicitly want to fight one another, they should be allowed to. I would suggest, however, that the consent cannot simply be "I want to fight", but that some limitation on the fight must be in place. Otherwise, there is a chance that, during the fighting, one fighter might not be able to concede or withdraw. That is, you shouldn't assume "I want to fight" means "I want to be seriously injured." If it seems likely that one of the fighters is about to be seriously hurt or incapacitated, I think the bystander's duty is to intervene - and the fight declared a victory for the other.

Essentially, I think you should change your view from your original title to: "People should not break up fights *when both fighters have explicitly stated that they want to fight*."</text>
