    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>When people ask where we’re from we usually refer to our country, not the continent. A German wouldn’t say they’re from Europe and the Chinese wouldn’t say they’re from Asia… the fucking Argentines and Brazilians desperately wanting to be called Americans looks like they’re just wanting to be from the US- it’s giving “left out” vibes for some reason and it’s silly. Associate with your country as everybody else does.</text>
