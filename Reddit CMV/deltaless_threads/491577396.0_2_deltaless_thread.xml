    <title>CMV: The Godfather III is better than II.</title>
    <original_poster>meadowsopr</original_poster>
    <original_post>For me, The Godfather Part II only shines when Robert DeNiro is on screen. Whenever the film cuts back to Michael I hate it, because I think it's a melodramatic pause from the good story. Part III is a consistent movie IMO, with the only inconsistency being a bad performance from Sofia Coppola. I think the drama is intriguing and Andy Garcia does a great job. 

TL;DR Although the Vito storyline in II is probably my favorite plot in the trilogy, the other plot is boring, whereas III is more consistent.

p.s. Godfather I trumps both II and III by a mile IMO.

    <text>They are all fucking great I hear a lot of back and forth about 2 and 3 and basically everyone puts number 1 on top. I think 2 is better than 3 dud to the Vito story along with Michaels pure genius and evilness. Plus he hits Kate in a hilarious charge that I always crack up at. 3s good but the genius shit is taken out. I really love the part where he keys the shit outta Zaraâ€™s car</text>
