    <title>I don't think the NSA spying on us is such a big deal. CMV</title>

    <original_post>Here is my reasoning: growing up parallel to the development of the internet my parents always warned me that anything you put into a computer someone out there can see. It is permanent. So I have always assumed there is always someone watching. That assumption at the end of the day hasn't really changed what I put on the internet because everything is strictly my opinion and I don't care what others think of it.

As far as the recording of phone conversations and storing of email, that is just a case of national security. these things need to be saved in case someone is planning a terrorist attack on our nation IMO.	

I am just a normal citizen like many of you, but my opinion differs on this subject matter and I want to understand what the big fuss about it is. It has always just been a common knowledge and understanding for me that I am being watched.</original_post>

    <text>Police have had, since the 1970s, legal authority to a phone company's records in the event of an investigation.  This doesn't seem so different, does it?

Except that police powers are reserved for States.  Giving police power to the Federal Government is an extraordinary step away from our original Federalist system.  Why not, now, a national firefighting service?  Why have city or State governments altogether?  It is a very slippery slope.</text>
