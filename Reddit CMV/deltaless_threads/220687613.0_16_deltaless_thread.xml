    <title>CMV: Rap Music Sucks</title>
    <original_poster>chronicallyfailed</original_poster>
    <original_post>So it may just be that all the rap I've listened too has been bad, but I really can't think of a rap song or a song featuring rapping that isn't just unlistenably bad. 

The lyrics, even when they're not breathtakingly sexist and homophobic, tend to be boring, unimaginative crap along the lines of "my penis is big and I do drugs" - not that I have anything against songs about penises and drugs, just the way it seems to be done in rap that I've heard is just boastful and repetetive.

Musically, I just hear incessant, grating melodies played over a shitty drumbeat while someone talks over the top of it. A lot of the time I don't really see how it qualifies as music.

Also, the amount of ridiculous, pretentious crap in the music videos just makes it hard for me to take them seriously at all.

But I don't really want to just dismiss rap music like that, so please explain to me how it's not shit, and examples of it not being shit would be nice too.

You kind of have to take this with a grain of salt. This is basically the rap equivalent of the "sex god" persona that rock stars of the 80s had going on.

Part of what you talk about is the boasting nature of rap. And while this isn't universally true, it comes about as part of the culture; a lot of rappers come from a scene of battle-rapping, where the whole point is that you have two rappers who get 90 seconds to lyrically, well, battle. They self-aggrandize and then put down the other guy. I don't know enough about the culture to know how/why this started, but I thought I'd throw that in since I hadn't seen it in the comments.</text>
