    <title>cmv: There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as an “American”</title>

    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>Whatever you said, the Germans would Euro-splain how you're wrong and beneath them.</text>

    <text>I got this in France too. Literally everybody in every country outside the US does it. 

Just like how everyone hates the best sports team of a given sport (e.g. the Yankees). 

They all have "genuine" complaints and criticisms and will swear up and down that it's not any sort if inferiority complex or Napoleon syndrome (and laugh at you excessively and obnoxiously for suggesting otherwise), but it's all a smokescreen... everyone always hates the top dog and wants to find reasons to tear them down</text>

    <text>It's just so mean-spirited.    America has lots of flaws, and we even lack a lot of other things that other countries do, but, among nice people, among people you want to be around, people don't insult people based on perceived things they don't have.    Like I wouldn't walk to a neighbor's house who had a smaller house than me or something and mock them for it.   But that's Europeans' entire identity and pastime.</text>
