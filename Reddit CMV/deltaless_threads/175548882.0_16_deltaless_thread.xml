    <title>CMV: Public transportation should run 24/7.</title>
    <original_poster>Keep-reefer-illegal</original_poster>
    <original_post>We live in a world that is no longer 9-5. Businesses stay open later, friends can reach us with a portable device simply by typing on a mini keyboard. It doesn't make sense that public transportation isn't 24/7. Here are some reasons why it should be 24/7:

1. Very few buses run at 2 am for last call, I feel like if nothing else, running buses later let's responsible drunk people take public transit instead of driving home. 

2. It would benefit the working poor who may work night shift 

3. As mentioned before our world is now 24/7 

Those are my arguments. 

I encourage you all to change my view 

Edit: by transit I am including trains, buses, all forms of public transportation, not just buses.

    <text>"The world is 24-7" doesn't mean anything. You might as well ask for subway stops on every street corner, or for new trains to arrive every two minutes. Where buses and subway trains go, how often they run, and during which hours is determined by demand. Even if we had more money to spend on public transit, there would be no reason to use it in the middle of the night, if there are practically no customers, when we could use it to create new routes or more frequent runs on existing routes. And there isn't an unlimited budget for transit; more transit money comes out of other programs, and ultimately the size of a city budget depends on tax rates and fees.

Remember also that the world is on a 9-5 schedule for a reason. Drivers and conductors need to sleep. Buses and trains need to be cleaned and repaired. Tracks need to be inspected and repaired.

Besides which, late at night the profile of people who want to use business and services changes. It's pointless to run a train all night if it will become a mobile homeless shelter; better to put the money into homeless shelters. It's pointless to run a train all night if you can't protect passengers from crime when the cars are basically abandoned. It's pointless to run a train all night if bus drivers are constantly having to intervene to break up fights between drunk riders.</text>
