    <title>I believe that prayer does nothing to change the world. CMV</title>

    <original_post>Prayer as an act of reaching to a deity for help or comfort has no appreciable effect beyond what can be achieved by normal positive thinking.

Praying to end world hunger or to get a job has no effect unless you or someone else makes the decision to achieve the goal. These goals could also just as easily be achieved without prayer.

Edit: I do not believe in the non corporeal nature of prayer. I do believe in the effects such as positive thinking giving someone a better understanding of who they are a what they can do.</original_post>

    <text>Prayer isn't just asking a Diety who may or may not be there to do something. It's a recognition that you believe in something bigger than yourself. People who pray will believe, firmly oftentimes, that someone is watching over them. Prayer reinforces this belief and by reinforcing a belief you build an ideology, a belief system, and so on. Every time someone prays a religion or belief lives a little longer. Those religions as a whole change the world whether it's through humanitarian aid or through a violent crusade. Prayer is just one of the building blocks or glue or whatever you want to call it that builds a belief or idea system. Ideas change the world. Prayers build ideas. </text>
