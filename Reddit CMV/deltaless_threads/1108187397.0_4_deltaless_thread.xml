    <title>CMV: voting for the president is pointless</title>
    <original_poster>TheRealPifftastic</original_poster>
    <original_post>The reason I feel this way is because of the electoral college.  The popular vote hasn't been used to elect a president since sometime in the 1800's. Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 2.8 million in 2016.All of the "get out and vote" sentiments are such a waste of time,money, and effort.  I do vote in local/state issues and politicians, because that really is the power of the people in action. All of my friends think I'm missing the point, and I may be. I really feel that out political system is deeply flawed. From all the special interests groups and lobbyists to tax breaks for multi million dollar companies that don't pay American taxes or pay a livable wage to the workers. I feel that nothing can change until the power of the people rule the country and not 538 voters that are easily swayed by greed.</original_post>

I'm not sure I follow this. The 538 electors are selected via the voters within the states. With the exception of a few "faithless electors" in history, they almost always vote for whichever candidate won their state. There's no place where greed has an impact.

There's plenty of issues with the electoral college, but I'm not really sure how it ruins the value of voting. Ultimately, you get to be a part of picking who your state places electors for for President -- that seems pretty valuable to me!</text>
