    <title>CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are not ethically superior to standard omnivorous diet</title>
    <original_poster>Kor03d</original_poster>
    <original_post>There is no point in becoming vegan or vegetarian in effort to save animals lives. Suffering or even death of a farm animal are no different to those of a tomato, even if it is harder to emotionally compassionate to the latter, as it is easier for us to relate to animal feelings. You can not exist without ending other creatures life for food, and animal lives are not more important than plants or fungi in that regard.

Please note that does not account for switching diet for own health reasons.

*EDIT: Yes, in my view I consider that plants can suffer even if they don't have the same mechanisms of perception animals do. Jellyfishes don't have a nervous system anywhere close to ours, yet it would still be unethical to cut one in pieces for amusement. Jellyfish would still perceive injury and its normal biological cycles would be hindered. Same goes for plants*

    <text>Do you consider wastefulness to be unethical?

Consider that you can provide nutrition for many more people by growing plants than by growing animals, from the same area of farmland, with much less disease and resource  expenditure.

You seem to see an inherent moral value in human life; from where does that stem? If it is value in minds, you should be able to see where I will go with this, but if not I will be interested to see where you derive your value from human life that excludes other animals.</text>
