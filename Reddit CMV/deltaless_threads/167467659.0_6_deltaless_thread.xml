Almost none of his comics were actually relevant or topical in any way.  They were basically just shock-jock level of "oh hey look how insulting I can be, come at me bro."  If he hadn't just been killed by a terrorist, this was basically 4chan level of trolling. Not even that really. 

"I don't have a wife or children or credit" etc, sure that applies to him, but not the other people killed. And, frankly, his comics were awful, pure 100% trolling, but now they're "genius" because he's dead.</original_post>

sources! sources!~ sources!

in this age of technology, you can find nearly all of his work and show it to us, so we can see how irrelevant, random and little sense it made.

So far everything the media shows makes sense.

Can you show us which ones you see as 100% troll? that make no sense?</text>
