    <title>CMV: Debt forgiveness is one of the stupidest ideas ever conceived</title>
    <original_poster>Ndlaxfan</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'll start this off by saying that I am in my last year of high school, and I will hopefully be attending a school that is about 60k a year. However, I will be graduating with under 5k in debt. I've worked my ass off for scholarships, and so far I've gotten about 205 k paid for. Most of the debt-forgiveness advocates are students who bit off more than they can chew, and will be swimming in piles of debt. If the government completely forgave debts, then they completely dick every financial institution in America. I view it like this: why would you go to an upscale restaurant, gorge yourself with food, and then be pissed off and demand that you can't pay the bill?</original_post>

    <text>Instead of taking a view of whats "fair" lets take a view of whats pragmatic.  Would you rather have a generation of students forgoing buying a home, getting married, and all the other trappings of adulthood because they have to pay off their loans with interest?

The economic ramifications of the student debt generation will be long felt.  It's simply better economic policy for the government to take over the debt and allow the free market to benefit from all the new spending it will see.  There really isn't any other form of government "spending" that would see such immediate economic impact.</text>
