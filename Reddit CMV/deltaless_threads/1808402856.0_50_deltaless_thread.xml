    <title>CMV: Fredom of speech is far more important than a few people being offended</title>
    <original_poster>brbrWh0r3</original_poster>
    <original_post>Freedom of speech should be protected and kept, there shouldn't be people arrested for anti trans comments or insulting a soldier/soldiers, or for nazi jokes, or racist remarks or jokes.

Those should all be handled between people, if someone says stuff you dont like you handle it, simply block them or avoid them, theres a whole world you can be in and that persons in a very tiny part of it. 

It makes me nervous seeing people arrested and charged for saying things. It's only leading us to a place where we can be arrested for saying whatever the government doesnt like. And they shouldn't be in that much power to effect our communication with eachother. 

I live in scotland and dont feel I have freedom of speech anymore. 

(For the record I'm a white woman who's bi and have trans thoughts ig for those folks who say it never has been about me, it has sometimes, and in more ways than just those)

Edit: No it's not just anti trans people, Yes I believe crimes other than hate crimes involving speech should be illegal (threatening violence, doxing, defamation) but I also believe insults, jokes and bad takes or thoughts should not be.

Edit 2: Consequences for what is said like losing a job, getting insulted, losing friends ect is totally fine I just dont think the Government should be in charge of what can get you arrested in this sence.

Edit 3: I live in SCOTLAND in the UNITED KINGDOM or in BRITAIN depending what you say, I'm not american, im also not here advocating for my right to be a dick, im just saying the government arent the ones I want saying what I cant say, I mean twitter can destroy lives without them anyway.</original_post>

    <text>My counter argument would be that they are equally unimportant. You and I and everyone we have ever know will die one day, and sometime after that, all those people will be completely forgotten by the remaining humans.

And say humanity goes on to live for quite some time, eventually, all of the stars will burn out in the universe. Entropy has reached a near maximum. The last of civilizations will be huddled around black holes, siphoning off hawking radiation to keep their little civilization afloat. But eventually, the black holes will dissipate into nothing and all energy in the universe will be uniformly distributed, and no life can possibly exist...

Given those circumstances that we face, could you explain how people being offended/free speech matters at all? Isn't it all a distraction from the cold truth that you and I and all of humanity will surely die?</text>
