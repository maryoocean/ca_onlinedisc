    <title>CMV: I should be able to sell my organs</title>
    <original_poster>stupidrobots</original_poster>
    <original_post>In short I should receive adequate compensation during life for use of my organs after my death.  The goal of this is to provide a financial incentive to increase the supply (and thus reduce cost) of organs required for transplant.  The benefits I see are as follows:

1) it gives the poor and disadvantaged a way to make money and get on their feet without requiring higher education or years of experience, relieving debts.

2) The financial incentive gives people reason to donate organs who might otherwise not.  This increases supply and drives down cost, and reduces time on waiting lists.  

3) A profitable program of organ collection would allow advertising for agencies that do this service and write up contracts, increasing the visibility of the needs of people who require organ transplants.

4) The argument that this creates a black market for organs is silly.  If someone wanted to kill you and take your organs, laws against it won't really help because now we're talking about maniacs.  

Furthermore my organs are my property, and I get to say what happens to my property during my lifetime and at the time of my death.  To deny this is to deny that individuals have the right to their own bodies.

    <text>It creates a strong market for fraud. It's not the black market that should be disturbing, it's abuse of the legal one. Suppose I owe someone a lot of money, what's stopping me from selling futures in my organs to someone else? Schemes where legal donors are killed or compelled to commit suicide for quick cash are easy to concoct. A policy where people are paid well for their organs would probably lead to a considerable rise in suicides, especially from poor and desperate people. People frequently kill themselves over debt. Suicides among farmers are unfortunately common and often driven by bad yields, rising costs, and rising debt. If there was a legal way to exchange your life for cash more people would take it and we, who allowed the market to exist, would be complicit in their deaths.</text>
