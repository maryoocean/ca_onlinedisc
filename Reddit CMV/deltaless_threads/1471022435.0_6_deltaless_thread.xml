    <title>CMV: In Breaking Bad, there are some serious Meth Math problems with Walter and Jessie's 3 month job working for Gus</title>
    <original_poster>RedditExplorer89</original_poster>
    <original_post>1.) They are making 200 pounds of meth a week for 3 months.  (source: The show)

2.) The meth sells at $40 an ounce. (Source:

Jessie keeps saying, "He's selling at 40 a pound".  I see 3 possibilities for this:

A.) He mean $40 a pound.  For all the risk they are taking to make Meth, that seems like too small of revenue.

B.) Me meant $40,000 a pound.  This sounds like astronomically too high.  How could Meth junkies ever afford their meth if 1 pound sells for 1 years minimum wage salary?

C.) He mis-poke, and meant $40 an ounce.  This sounds most plausible to me, as it means they are making some decent money from their risk and Meth junkies can still afford to buy their meth.)

3.) There are 16 ounces in a pound. (Source: [Google](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;amp;q=ounces+in+a+pound))

4.) They are working for 13 weeks.  (Source:

Assuming ~31 days in a month, ~31 x 3 = ~93 days in 3 months.  ~93/7 = ~13 weeks in 3 months)

5.)  Conclusion: The meth they make for Gus during the 3 months can sell for ~1.5 million dollars.  (Source:

$40 (per ounce) x 16 (ounces per pound) x 200 (pounds per week) x 13 (weeks in the job) = $1,664,000, or ~1.5 million dollars)

Now lets get down to the problems here:

**Gus is losing money**

Gus is paying 3 million dollars for these two guys to make product that he will sell for 1.5 million dollars.  That's 1.5 million dollars down the drain.

**Walter and Jessie are bad at Math**

Jessie and Walter both come to the conclusion that Gus is making 93 million off their 3 month job.  Given all the information we have, they should have come to 1.5 million.  Jessie I could understand making a mistake somewhere in this math.  But Walter is supposed to be the smart guy.  How could he also make this mistake?

**What would change my view**:

1.) Show me a way to interpret the information in the show in such a way that the job is profitable for Gus while still being based in reality.

2.) Explain why both Walter and Jessie made such bad math mistakes in their calculations.

Bonus points if you can do both.

**What wouldn't change my view**

*This was a mistake the show-writers made.*  If this is the case I apologize since it means there isn't really a view to be changed here.  However, I have hope that there is something I am missing that explains this mess.

Edits/deltas:

* Gus is doing this venture as a long term plan.  Once he has Walt's formula, he can start making money again.

* The math at $40k a pound checks out for Walter and Jessie's calculation if you assume 12 weeks instead of 13 weeks.  12 instead of 13 weeks seems like a simple enough mistake if you assume the 4 weeks per month as many people do.  $40k a pound for meth seems unrealistic to me, but at least that is a flaw in the world building rather than Walter or Jessie's character.

* Junkies buy in teenths (1/16 of an ounce), which makes selling Meth at $40k a pound more reasonable.  Also, $40k a pound checks out with how much money Walter and Jessie were making when they cooked in their RV.

* Real Meth sells at about the $40k per pound value.  Looks like the show was actually being very realistic after all!</original_post>

By my meth math, it's almost exactly this.  I don't think you realize how much a *pound* of drugs is.  A pound of meth would be about 1800 doses, so yeah, a junkie couldn't afford something like 5 years worth at 1 dose/day all in one go.

Meth costs [$80/gram](https://www.rehabcenter.net/the-average-cost-of-illegal-drugs-on-the-street/), which is about 4 doses (each dose being 1/4 gram) each of which can last between 6 and 24 hours. At $20/dose it's not remotely the cheapest hobby, but also not inaccessible for kind of desperate people we're talking about.  Think about how much an alcoholic would be spending in a day.

Since there are 454 grams to a pound, that means a pound would have a street value of 80\*454= $36,320.  Now this is a *little* low especially when you consider this is $36k *street value* vs $40k *wholesale*.  But when you remember that this is the special blue meth that sells at a premium, it all seems reasonable again.</text>

    <text>Well said and well sourced.  Already gave a delta for this though.

&amp;gt; I don't think you realize how much a pound of drugs is

Basically this.  It's crazy to think that 1 little pound of meth could get you a car.  It makes me all the more in awe now when I watch the show and see Walter cooking *200* pounds a week.</text>

    <text>If you think that's expensive check out the price of lsd</text>

    <text>Lol a pound of lsd when dosages are measured in micrograms, it's got to be astronomical and no 1 person would need that much</text>

    <text>1 pound = 453592370  micrograms(ug) 
125 ug usually sells for 10-20 USD

So we're talking roughly 35 to 70 million USD for 1 pound of LSD</text>

    <text>Picture the kind of pill bottles  you see all the time, you know, the ones you'd get if you filled a proscription. If those pills are good recreational drugs each pill would sell on the street for something close to $10, where I live. A backpack of pills would be worth, well, I don't know what, but it would be worth a lot of money.

Hardcore drugs are worth more than their weight in gold.</text>

    <text>Meth costs about $20 a gram nowadays.  Back in the days of BB it was more expensive though.</text>

    <text>Very much depends on where you get it, who you get it from, and how much you are buying at once. $100 per gram was standard for a long time if you're buying by the gram.</text>

    <text>A quarter gram is way way too high for a dose. A heavy dose is about 60-80mg not 250mg. Unless you had a sky high tolerance. But even then that’s still very high. A pound is more like  5000-7000 doses. Given we are talking about a relatively pure product that isn’t cut, like the meth in BB.</text>

    <text>They talk about “teenths”, sixteenths of an ounce, 1771 milligrams.  I guess that is 20 doses?</text>

    <text>Yeah if you’re smoking it or shooting it and you don’t have a high tolerance it would be. So around 12-20 doses.</text>

    <text>I was absolutely coming here to do this same math. As someone who used to do meth, in the Midwest it could go for as high as $20 for a *tenth* of a gram 20 years ago, and I was just at a music festival a couple of weeks ago where someone tried to sell me some (I don't do it anymore but still apparently look like I'd buy some) for $90/gram.</text>

    <text>There is a YouTube (Chosen Won) channel where homeless women are interviewed about their life. I was surprised how they said they spent $200-400 a day on their drug addictions.</text>
