    <title>CMV: Self proclaimed "anti-SJWs" are just as annoying and entitled as the people they oppose.</title>
    <original_poster>Ninjachibi117</original_poster>
    <original_post>Allow me to preface this with saying that I have an idpol bias and am a leftist, so this may make my views on social issues somewhat skewed or biased to one side. I'd also like to say that personally, I couldn't care less where someone stands on social or political issues as long as they're not an ass about it; in fact, talking and politely debating with people you disagree with is excellent and should be encouraged.

As most people know, there's been a recent trend in visibility of so called "social justice warriors"; people who take identity politics and social issues as a matter of life and death (this is a general meaning, not directly true for every "sjw"). This is in part both due to and responsible for the advances in rights and equal treatment for minorities and marginalised groups with the exceptions of a few classes of people. Now personally, I'm all for the betterment of marginalised people, but there's certainly people who take these matters a bit too far, even going so far as to send death threats or other negative shenanigans to those that they perceive as opposing them even if their target agrees with them on most things. Tumblr is a popular social media for this type of people though there is a fair mix of more moderate and even some extreme contrarians on that platform.

With this comes the contrarian trend of "anti-SJWs", people who adamantly oppose those perceived to be social justice warriors and dedicate sometimes extreme levels of energy to combating them. Popular examples include many 4chan users, r/TumblrInAction and some blogs hosted, ironically, on Tumblr. These are varied in firmness of opinion from mild dissent ("oh shut up, nobody cares") to firm opposition (see: the amazing atheist) to comical levels of devotion (4chan vs Shia Laboeuf).

Now, the concept of these anti-SJWs is a weird one to me as it seems unnecessarily contrarian; nobody's hurting you so severely by believing they're a fox from another world with six dicks that you need to devote large amounts of energy and time to do nothing but basically just be a dick to them for the luls. However, that aside, the thing many of these anti-SJWs seem to fail to grasp is that, at least from my view point, they're just as bad as the people they devote their time to, if not worse. Nothing is achieved by spamming some 14 year old kid's Tumblr with gore and hate mail or getting a man arrested for defending yourself other than showing what a petty asshole you choose to be.

Many of the points they rag on "SJWs" for are things they're guilty of as well. Popular points include intolerance of dissenting opinions, dedication to harassment or personal attacks of people seen as disagreeing, being whiny/petty, rejecting science, and being entitled and unable to function in the real world. Yet the entire movement is based on this intolerance and these attacks, with pettiness or simply being whiny being a major cause. They commonly reject modern scientific findings on matters such as gender, neurodivergency, and other topics that they accuse "SJWs" of misrepresenting. And this might just be me, but nothing seems more entitled than spending your free time attacking or harassing people (often children) because they think they're some thing you don't believe in or because they see an inequality somewhere you don't.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you have to agree. You can believe someone's an absolute fucking idiot, but that doesn't mean you need to go after them. Anti-SJWs are part of and worsen the "SJW problem" they dedicate themselves to combat.

EDIT: I'd like to make it clear that my point is about the main, general concept of each movement or belief and not about specific beliefs or people as people on all sides are diverse in background and in thoughts. If it helps you visualise this better, make an imaginary example of each general idea instead of focusing on specific real world views. Thanks to u/Cupcakesarethedevil for helping me clarify.</original_post>

    <text>I can't talk about annoying, because that's subjective. But as far as entitled goes, its like this. As a self-proclaimbed anti-sjw warrior, my problem is from the outside it looks to me like all these children are very upset they didn't get to march with Martin and are trying to make up for it now. They take issues and just light them on fire. . .  And I'll say this. The opposition is coming from a philisophical place. The SJW ethis  (sorry for spelling,) opposes something I value, and its hard to define what that is. I'm all for equality, and reducing racism, and giving everyone a fair shot at what they want in life. . . I've always wanted equality under the law. And the sjw movement almost feels like that want after cancer mutated it into something self-distructive. . . There is an instance of a girl who said she was raped asking a DJ not to play the song blurred lines at the venu where she was, and it turned into a big thing. And my attitude is that you should have to deal with blurred lines, in life,  philisophicly. I'm fully, entirely blind. And I advicate for myself on a regular basis. There are times where I have to speak up and say, "Hey, I need some help, or "legally, this is what I get," but I also understand I live in a world of sited people, and don't expect that world to be tailored to me in every particular. . . Further, if I was out in the world and someone insulted me for being blind, or hit me with some of those micro agressions, my respponse would be to insult that person back, and this should be the response to everything, all the time. </text>

    <text>My disagreement with your philosophy aside, your example of the girl not wanting to hear Blurred Lines is a bit excessive. This "real world" mindset doesn't hold up because in the real world, people are understanding and accepting of accommodations from time to time. Not wanting to hear a specific song due to trauma of being raped is pretty reasonable as accommodations go.</text>

    <text>Sure, its reasonable. So you leave where it's playing. I should note that it wasn't like the song she was raped to, she didn't want to hear the song because of its themes so spoke to a DJ at a club and asked the song not be played. Its the difference between avoiding things you don't like and making others avoid them.  </text>
