    <title>Women are the inferior gender. CMV</title>
    <original_poster>TyKillsTyGoT</original_poster>
    <original_post>This is an issue I have really struggled with since adolescence and would love to have my views changed. I'm sexist. No bones about it. I know that I should think women are equal and holding these views makes me less civilized, but I haven't been able to find any evidence that would change my mind. 

The smartest people are men. The strongest people are men. It seems like women are average while men can excel or fail spectacularly. Harvard president Larry Summers agrees that men are better suited for certain difficult tasks.

I really want to be able to look at women as people but whenever I see a pretty woman in a nice car, I automatically assume someone bought it for her. When I see a woman out shopping, I wonder what her spouse does to afford her these priveledges. 

The women in my life seem to support this hypothesis. I know some girls who are very smart, but they're not on the level of the smartest guys I know. I also know some girls who are very physically fit but once again they cant compare to the fit men I know and research agrees with both of these points. 

I want to get over this beleif because I feel like it is tainting all my interactions with women and as a result the view is being reinforced more and more each day. 

So please reddit, CMV.</original_post>

    <text>It depends on how you measure inferior.

Humans are the inferior species to whales, if you're measuring "superiority/inferiority" by the ability to swim.

Men are superior physically, yes.  A lot of spacial and intelligence tests would say men are superior as well.  Measure by income?  Men are superior.

But women have superior emotional intellgience( [source](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-brain-and-emotional-intelligence/201104/are-women-more-emotionally-intelligent-men) ) and humans are, first, emotional creatures.

Women are better at raising and nurturing infants (no sources here, but do we need any?).  Where would humanity be if it lacked that skillset?

I could go on.  

Yes, society is still "traditional" in the sense that males are typically the breadwinners.  You see a woman in a glamorous car and the odds are that a man provided it.  But how does greater ability to purchase a car make one a superior gender?

It's not about being superior or inferior.  Both genders are *just different*.  To the "Yang" side, it appears that "Yin" lacks a lot of important things.  *But that's the point*.</text>
