    <title>CMV: Major corporate failings (such as deceptive subprime lending) should result in punishments at all levels of individual responsibility.</title>
    <original_poster>luminarium</original_poster>
    <original_post>The process would be as follows: 

1. Society should find out who is directly responsible / performed the action
2. Did he report it to his superior and at least one other person in his chain of command (ie. superior's superior)?
3. If no, then he's fired, fined for the full amount of his past year's salary, and banned from the industry for three years.
4. For all the people he reported the issue to, or who knew about the issue, and who should have done something about this, but didn't, or who should have reported it up further, but didn't: repeat steps 2, 3, and 4.

As a corollary, all corporations should be required to educate employees that they are to report anything that could potentially be seen as immoral or illegal, to not just their supervisor but someone further up the chain of command, and to educate them of the consequences should they fail to do so. Supervisors are to be educated that if they become aware of the issue and take no action to fix or escalate the issue, that they will be held responsible as well. 
This policy wouldn't be retroactive.

The idea is that if the underlings had duly reported the issue and the supervisors hadn't, the supervisors would be punished. Every single individual who should have reported or done something to fix the issue but didn't would simultaneously be held liable. If the issue had been reported all the way up to the executive level, then the fines would be massive (since executives make far more). This way there would be incentive for issues to be escalated all the way up, and an incentive for those with the decision making power to do something about it.

Virtually impossible without a paper trail and usually there isn't one.

&amp;gt;2&amp;amp;3&amp;amp;4: Did he report it to his superior and at least one other person in his chain of command (ie. superior's superior)? If no, then he's fired, fined for the full amount of his past year's salary, and banned from the industry for three years. For all the people he reported the issue to, or who knew about the issue, and who should have done something about this, but didn't, or who should have reported it up further, but didn't: repeat steps 2, 3, and 4.

The government can't make a company fire a person. It can revoke licenses and institute fines but only with due process. Again, this requires proof and a paper trail.

Lastly, speaking specifically about the financial collapse of 2008-2010, virtually ZERO laws were broken. Were people unethical? Hell yes. Did people lie? Absolutely. Did they take risks with other people's money knowing they wouldn't have to pay penalties if/when they failed? You bet. But none of those things were illegal. *Some* action has been taken since then to make some of those things illegal but we can't retroactively go back and hold people to a set of laws that didn't exist at the time.

    <text>Sure, my proposal would only be applicable for where it *is* possible to identify who is responsible (which may require paper trails) and wouldn't be retroactively applied.</text>
