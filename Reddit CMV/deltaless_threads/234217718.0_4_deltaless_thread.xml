    <title>CMV: When logic and emotion clash, logic should always win.</title>
    <original_poster>renaissanceman975</original_poster>
    <original_post>Whenever a decision is made, a conclusion drawn, an idea perused or any other circumstance that might result in logic clashing with emotions I believe people should accept the logical side over the emotional side 100% of the time.

Now when I say a logical point in contrast to emotion I mean a point of view or course of action or what have you that, based on all the information you have available and can have logic applied to it, is different than what your feelings/gut/instinct/intuition/conventional wisdom/etc leads you to.

I know that you can't get off the ground without emotion, and that logic depends on values and life is meaningless if logic is all we use and so on. I don't think we should disregard emotion entirely, plently of situations don't need to employ logic (do I like ice cream or cake better?) and others may coincide with logic (when deciding whether to get married, maybe all the logical aspects agree with your emotions). However, in situations where we have an objective, take all the information we have available to us and apply logic, yet the way we feel about it leads us to a different conclusion, we should go with the logical side.

Sometimes, if there is a logical and emotional course of action and you didn't know how it would turn out the logical course turns out to have been worse in retrospect. But if you follow the logical course 100% of the time you'll maximize the amount of 'optimal choices'.

Let's I want to go to college and pursue a career, and my goals are to maximize my happiness and balance that with financial stability/income. I can choose career X and career Y to pursue. Obviously if I'm purely logical from start to finish I won't get off the ground, so I follow whatever emotional drives I have until logic can be applied for some result. Career X appeals to my emotions because it excites me and has romantic appeal and has a small possibility of incredible success but is likely to result in having poor financial stability, the excitement will usually wears off among people in that field. Career Y doesn't appeal emotionally (at the time of making the choice) because it seems boring but usually people in that field have good job satisfaction, it has steady and moderate advancement but will never be lucrative. *Given my goal of maximizing happiness and balancing it with maximizing income/financial stability* then it seems clear that job Y is a better choice. If the choice is made a zillion times, in the end I'll be happier and more stable with Y more often than not.

If job Y happened to appeal to me emotionally, then there is no conflict and you can go with your gut. If my goal is not happiness/stability but excitement and having a chance to become crazy rich, then X is the logical choice and again there is no conflict. 

I'm not saying emotion is bad. I'm saying emotion should lose to logic if it ever conflicts with it, because it's less reliable.

    <text>the best decisions would be made with 50 percent logic and 50 percent emotion to get the best of both worlds, would it not?</text>

    <text>I would say the best decisions are made with 100% logic and 100% emotion(al honesty). They really aren't mutually exclusive</text>

    <text>so all decisions should be based on 200 percent of logic and emotion</text>

    <text>You have two containers; one contains logic, and one contains emotions. You want *both* of them to be full.

If you are speaking of % of the 'total motivation', then it is like asking whether it is the driver or the gasoline that makes a car go. You can't give them percents, because removing either would render the whole vehicle immobile ^(Tesla ruins the metaphor completely, but whatever)</text>

    <text>Percentages are based on how you define them. For example I can be 100% human and 100% European at the same time while remaining consistent. Likewise if you reject that emotion and logic are incompatible (like I would) you can say that you use 100% logic and 100% emotion withou being inconsistent.</text>

    <text>Depends on the context and the desired outcome. If I want to do my bills, 100% would be the desired outcome. Similarly if I'm in anything in academic mathematics I'd rather not use emotion. </text>

    <text>desire is an emotion. together with logic you make the decision to use 100 percent logic in these specific circumstances and by doing so, you end up happy</text>

    <text>Barely, you aren't actually deliberating the decision using logic, just deciding *to* deliberate it. Moreover, it isnt 50%. </text>
