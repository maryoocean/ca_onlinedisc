    <title>CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are not ethically superior to standard omnivorous diet</title>
    <original_poster>Kor03d</original_poster>
    <original_post>There is no point in becoming vegan or vegetarian in effort to save animals lives. Suffering or even death of a farm animal are no different to those of a tomato, even if it is harder to emotionally compassionate to the latter, as it is easier for us to relate to animal feelings. You can not exist without ending other creatures life for food, and animal lives are not more important than plants or fungi in that regard.

Please note that does not account for switching diet for own health reasons.

*EDIT: Yes, in my view I consider that plants can suffer even if they don't have the same mechanisms of perception animals do. Jellyfishes don't have a nervous system anywhere close to ours, yet it would still be unethical to cut one in pieces for amusement. Jellyfish would still perceive injury and its normal biological cycles would be hindered. Same goes for plants*

    <text>Even working within the confines of your premise, vegetarianism leads to less suffering overall. 

Eating meat requires you to kill the plants to feed the animals and then the animals themselves. A vegetarian diet removes one degree of killing, if that's worth anything. 

Anyway, I reject the idea that a tomato suffers. A tomato plant may suffer if you chop it up, but i think the fruit is supposed to be separated from the plant. There are many fruits and grains we could still eat without harming the plant. </text>

    <text>Animal not being killed has nothing to do with plants it killed (or that were killed for its nutrition).</text>

    <text>I think we're kind of talking past each other here. I think you're assuming the animal would exist and eat plants whether or not someone is going to eat it. 

I'm thinking of an agricultural market perspective. The animal only exists and is killed because there is demand for it to be eaten. Plants are raised and harvested to feed the animal. We could instead raise and harvest plants to feed humans and never breed the animal in the first place, thus one fewer degree of killing. </text>
