    <title>CMV:Patriotism is the worst emotion and has basically no redeeming value</title>

    <original_post>I'm Canadian and today is our 150th anniversary. It got me thinking about patriotism as did a recent episode of One the Media which can be found here;

Canadians are not very patriotic, at least compared to our American neighbours. I think a strong argument can be made that this is a huge benefit to Canadian culture and democracy. 

On the surface patriotism seems somewhat benign or even good. How can it be bad to feel good about ones country? However, little good actually comes from patriotism. Our world is increasingly global yet patriotism only reinforces sectarian and tribal ideas. It can be argued it is largely responsible for the rise of the alt-right and the anti-globalism in America and elsewhere. 

It is also nearly always factually inaccurate. In nearly every case, people who think their country is the best in some way are just wrong about the facts.

Patriotism also reinforces otherness which leads to racism, sexism, anti-intellectualism and xenophobia.

Patriotism is always used as a political weapon with the sole purpose of stifling critical thinking or open debate. One is not to question any idea that can be wrapped in the guise of patriotism.

Finally, patriotism nearly always blinds people to the problems in their own society and allows those problems to persist far longer than they should.

I'd be curious to see data but I would hypothesize there is an inverse correlation between the levels of patriotism in a country and the health of its political system.

I honesty cannot think of a redeeming quality to patriotism.

    <text>All right, patriotism isn't an emotion... in most places. In America, it's one hundred percent an emotion.

Emotions are *not* universal. An American will most likely never experience the need to want to hunt for a head, for example.

People feel emotions because they're trying to express something. The value comes in translating it.

Patriotism has no value to you because you either are unable to decipher it's true meaning (it means help we're scared of how powerful we are so we have to shut down parts of our brain in order to function and ignore the pain of others,) or you truly do not value the message it's trying to send you.

But that doesn't mean it has no value. Someone else will receive the message, and perhaps then something shall be done.</text>
