    <original_post>Prayer as an act of reaching to a deity for help or comfort has no appreciable effect beyond what can be achieved by normal positive thinking.

Praying to end world hunger or to get a job has no effect unless you or someone else makes the decision to achieve the goal. These goals could also just as easily be achieved without prayer.

Edit: I do not believe in the non corporeal nature of prayer. I do believe in the effects such as positive thinking giving someone a better understanding of who they are a what they can do.</original_post>

    <text>Nobody can. Nobody has any proof as it stands that prayer works. 

Sure it changes the world though. Only not in the way it's intended to. Or exactly how it's intended to - as a way to keep people obedient among other religious rituals. 

Obedient people who believe death is the ultimate bonus trip to Hawaii make good soldiers. 

Prayer changes the world all the time in that sense. But it's a tool like a shovel or a gun and nothing more. Nothing magical. Just plain human idiocy and greed. 

So yeah just because something doesn't work the way you expect it to doesn't mean that it doesn't have a huge effect on society. </text>
