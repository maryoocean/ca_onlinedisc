    <title>CMV: It should be illegal for the police in unmarked vehicles to pull people over for traffic offences</title>
    <original_poster>joelzundel</original_poster>
    <original_post>**Argument 1**


Imagine two cop cars driving along a motorway in opposite directions. One of them is marked, while the other is not. 

The unmarked one is going with the flow, which is usually a couple km/h over the limit, pulling people over. They only pull over maybe 4 cars an hour, and everybody else is not slowing down, simply because they can't see the police. From a civilian standpoint this creates a paradigm: the police are there only to collect money for the government. 

On the other side of the motorway, the marked police car is driving normally, and obviously nobody is overtaking them. Everyone stays safe and happy.

IMO: The police should do it's best to keep people safe, not collect money.

**Argument 2**

Some jackass buys a used police car, some lights a siren, and a uniform off Ebay. Drives around in unpopulated areas, pulling people over and robbing them/killing them/whatever other crime. The victim can not refuse to pull over - it's a very serious offence in most countries. It wouldn't be such a problem if traffic police would only use marked cars.

The idea here is to instill fear into drivers that police can be out there even if you can't see a police cruiser.

If the police only drove marked vehicles, people would slow down ONLY when they see a cop.

Use of unmarked cars can potentially encourages safe driving even when police are not around.</text>

    <text>Statistically, the chances of getting pulled over by an unmarked car are pretty low, so most people don't bother worrying about that. 

A much more efficient solution is , for example , a movable speed radar/camera</text>

    <text>If anything this seems to be an argument for having MORE unmarked cars.</text>

    <text>That is an argument to have more unmarked cars. </text>

    <text>You haven't shown the validity of using unmarked cars, yet you use the notion that 'we don't have enough marked cars' as justification for needing more marked cars? Aren't you putting the cart before the horse here?</text>
