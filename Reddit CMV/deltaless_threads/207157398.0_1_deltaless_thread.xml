    <title>CMV: People who give their kids two last names are inconsiderate</title>
    <original_poster>NeoshadowXC</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured into taking her's husband's last name, and gay spouses also have a conundrum of their own. 

However, I think that a family should have a family name, because otherwise you are choosing to make everyone else's life difficult. One small example is if you work in an industry where you deal with a lot of names and families and meeting people blind (like I do). It's helpful to know in advance who is related to who by just looking at a piece of paper.

BUT, if the wife and the husband choose not to share a last name, please God settle on one name for your kid. Just flip a coin for which last name your kid takes if that's what you need to do. Don't make everyone around him have to deal with saying and writing out Reginald Henry Lieberman-Montgomery. 

A metaphor I would make for this would be gender pronouns. You have the right to tell me whether you identify as a man or a woman, but I swear to God if you insist that everyone around you refer to you strictly with the gender neutral pronouns Ni, Nem and Nir, I will be having none of it. 

As a counterpoint, I will say that I can't ever imagine myself taking my wife's last name. And if she chose not to take mine, I think I would feel a little disappointed. Further, I can't imagine feeling comfortable with my kid not taking my last name. So I already recognize a bit of the hypocrisy. In that way, I see that I am posing a problem without an apparent solution. On top of your rebuttals, I would also be curious to hear alternative ideas/social structures that could work to level the playing field, AND prevent me from having to say a mouthful. 

**EDIT:**

Apologies for the day long delay-- car emergency took all night and all morning.

Thanks for all your responses! Here are some of my views you've changed. 

Spain &amp;gt; 'Murica. There's a clear system in place in Spanish countries that actually speaks to my "one family name" point. People consistently take the fathers, then mother's surname. Then the kid's kids will do the same. Gives you family history and also something to put on your mailbox. 

What I personally like about this is that it's uniform. If two last names were adopted country-wide in America, I would have much less of a problem with it. 

I also want to clarify: My problem with the "mouthful" of hyphenated last names does not mean that I would also suggest gentrifying the Krzyzewskis and the Chevaprevadumrongs of the world. To shorten your family name is to bastardize it. No ill feelings to those with shortened last names of course-- my last name was actually gentrified two generations ago. 

Finally, here is a post that very well summarizes my American sentiments: 

&amp;gt; While this drifts from your true argument, these lines of thinking quickly move into the larger name-choice debate, which in my experience usually boils down to “People who name their kids something I like or understand are exercising reasonable freedom of choice. People who name their kids something I dislike or don’t understand are selfish and stupid.” You have not said this, but I think it is worth pointing out that are cultural biases about names are deep-seated.

&amp;gt; You want people to have choices about identity labels - - - as long as every choice is based on what you find easiest and most comfortable. If a stranger's choice is not based on your preference, they are selfish and inconsiderate. When a family you do not know fills out a birth certificate, you ask that the FIRST priority be guessing your experience if you meet their child at work in twenty years, and the SECOND priority be articulating their identity as a family in a way that feels personally appropriate.

My American sensibilities that shorter is better are deeply ingrained and will probably be there 'til I die. That said, at least I can recognize them so that I know to keep them in check. 

While I will continue to make fun of people who have two last names, it will be with the same conviction that I make fun of everyone else. No hostility here.

Thanks guys!</original_post>

What about step-families with mis-matched names? 

Or non-married families where the mother and child have a different last name?

Should we expect a child living with his/her mother to change his/her last name because their mother remarried and changed her last name?

&amp;gt; where you deal with a lot of names and families and meeting people blind 

How many people work in industries where they meet people blind and need to know if they're related? My mom kept her last name and it has never been a problem in 30 years.

What about people with very confusing names? I'd say the name Smith-Jones is much easier to say than something Krzyzewski. Does someone with a confusing last name owe it to us to choose a more traditional last name?</text>

    <text>The step families and non-married families are fine as they are-- it would be useful as a sign right up front that the kid is adopted or a step child. But of course that only works if all other families use the same name. 

As to your second point, what I'll say is that what other people have been suggesting to me: two last names serves as a better road map for who is related to who. In that way, if there was a widely adopted system where EVERYONE used two last names (like in Spain), there would be more uniformity and would actually make finding connections between people easier.

As to Smith-Jones vs Krzyzewski, I think Krzyzewski &amp;gt; Smith-Jones. Something about the hyphen. Takes away from the roundness of the name. I'm not going to defend this point of view, I already know it's entirely irrational. To that end, I will say that for every Smith-Jones, you also get a Krzyzewski-Mrzyglocki.</text>
