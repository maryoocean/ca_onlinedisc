    <title>CMV: Picky eaters deserve more respect and shouldn’t be shamed for being picky</title>
    <original_poster>UsualMorning98</original_poster>
    <original_post>It’s not always the picky eater’s fault they’re picky. It could be due to how they were raised (not their fault), trauma or sensory issues with food (something that can be really hard to work through) and many other factors.

A lot of them either try their best to make things easier for “regular” eaters (bringing their own food to events, looking at the menu beforehand, ordering from the kid’s menu, simply not eating that meal/day etc) or feel extreme guilt when they can’t accommodate to those who will shame them.

I’m not saying they should be prioritised over people with allergies or those with other food needs (like vegetarians or those who don’t eat certain foods for religious reasons). But they deserve a little more respect and support because it’s also hard for them being picky eaters. Definitely prioritise food issues that could harm someone. But once that’s sorted, don’t get mad at the picky eaters for just trying to exist.</original_post>

    <text>Problem with your view is that "picky eaters" is such a broad group filled with different type of people that it's almost impossible to make any global statement.

So yes, some picky eaters are trying to fix the problem and try their best while other are arrogantly saying there's nothing wrong with eating always the same meal. Some picky eaters have some sort of medical problems, some are just being very childish and immature about it.

Since there isn't a big study comparing the numbers of each category to say to you that "bad picky eaters" are most numerous than "good picky eaters" the only argument I could use is that most picky eating happens during childhood and fade away when being adult which tend to prove it's often (but not always) a problem of maturity.

Now of course, I'm not saying we should shame immature people (or consider that every picky eater is simply immature) but we must not pretend that it's totally ok and healthy to be a super picky eater either.</text>
