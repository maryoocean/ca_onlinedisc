    <title>CMV: Tipping makes no sense</title>
    <original_poster>adashofasshole</original_poster>
    <original_post>The general logic I hear behind tipping is because the driver or waiter does not make enough money. 

Well how is it the consumers fault that they are not making enough money? I can see the fault being placed on the employer for not paying enough, or even the company, but to place the responsibility on the consumer is completely lost to me. It would make more sense to me to even blame the employee for not working harder to find a better paying job (not the main point). 

The equivalent would be expecting kids to bring in money to give to underpaid teachers, which makes a lot more sense to me as students in public schools are not paying teachers for their service. 

Please, change my view. 

Edit: I still give my fair share of tips, also I understand it is not mandatory but it is highly frowned upon when someone doesnâ€™t tip. </original_post>

    <text>In terms of a restaurant I consider the bill to be the cost of the food you ate and the tip to be the bill for the server. In terms of uber or cab drivers, the bill is for the gas to get you from point A to point B and the tip is the bill for the driver taking you from point A to point B. Like it or not it does give the consumer more buying power since they are allowed to set the price that seems fair for the service they received, opposed to combining the tip and the bill for a service you might of not tipped %20 on.</text>
