    <title>People should not break up fights unless one of the fighters explicitly states that they don't want to be fighting. CMV</title>

    <original_post>This has always been a major peeve of mine. I like watching random people fight, and I've been in a few myself. Every time there's a fight, some asshole decides to be a hero and try to break it up. Back in high school, these two kids pulled us apart even though we both explicitly stated that we wanted to fight. Now, I understand why a teacher, cop, or bouncer would do it, nothing against them, but if you're not an authority figure or at risk of injury or property damage yourself, you should let the people fight. For example, if you form a fight ring in high school around the two combatants, then no one is getting hurt, and nor is anyone not involved in the fight getting injured. In that case, no one should intervene unless an authority figure arrives. 

Now of course, there are exceptions. For example, if one person clearly does not want to be in the fight, then someone should break it up. For example, they may be asking for help or just being pummeled without throwing any punches themselves. Or if you witnessed the fight from the very beginning and one guy clearly just attacked the other without provocation. Then you should break up the fight. 

Otherwise, two adults should be allowed to fight and no one should intervene until one of them either states that he does not want to fight anymore, or is put into a state into which he cannot express this desire. Otherwise, people should just enjoy the show and mind their own fucking business.

    <text>If you are fighting in a public place where other people are around to break you apart, then they should be able to. A fight is disturbing the peace, and there's a chance of other people in the vicinity getting injured. You're free to fight on your private property without anyone interrupting. If you're in your living room pummeling a guy down, nobody will be there to stop. But while there are other people around on property you don't own, you have no right to start a conflict like that. Fight all you want, but do it on your own soil.</text>

    <text>You're right if we are fighting in an office or something. However, if there is a circle around the fighters and everyone is cheering, then clearly people want to watch, and in that case, people should mind their own business. </text>

    <text>Even then, if it's not your property, you have no right to be fighting there. If it's public property like a school or a park, you definitely aren't allowed to be fighting there. Any privately owned place most likely doesn't want it to be associated with fighting either. If you wanna fight, go to a place you own or get permission from the owner. If you own a bar, store, or parking lot, you are trying to make money, and fights give your place a negative reputation. Nobody breaks up UFC fights, because they're in a fighting place. All you need to do is find a safe place where you're allowed to fight, and you're good. Otherwise, you really have no right to start a commotion where you're not allowed to.</text>
