    <title>Childless adults should not go to Disneyland and Disneyworld. These are for children and families, and adults have the entire world to experience. CMV.</title>

    <original_post>As an adult of moderate means, you have access to the adventures and experiences that Disneyland (and related parks) simulate. You can go whitewater rafting, tour Czech castles and Parisian catacombs and sail the actual Caribbean. Disneyland is obviously an amusement targeted at children, and so adults without children should seek alternative forms of entertainment.

As a more practical addendum to the above, I gather that Disneyland and other parks are exceptionally busy, often resulting in long lines for the attendees. If adults without children eschewed them, then they'd actually be enriching the experience for the parks' target audience.

EDIT (Sept. 4, 19:00 CET): I'm afraid I'm out of time to respond to other comments--thanks for the conversation.</original_post>

    <text>Disneyland is a business whose main form of attraction is entertainment.  Do you think the Tower of Terror, which is based off The Twilight Zone is for children?  Do you think someone who loved Harry Potter as a teenager is going to suddenly going to lose wonder in a Harry Potter Themed ride as an adult?  Another example: legoland.  Legos are conventionally targeted as kids, doesn't mean adults can't enjoy the spectacle of amazing lego sculptures from an artistic or nostalgic standpoint.

Adults can be equally entertained by rides as children, and they are paying customers that allow this business to profit, so I highly doubt Walt Disney would agree with you here.  </text>
