    <title>CMV: Body autonomy is not a human right where it conflicts with other human rights</title>
    <original_poster>redhighways</original_poster>
    <original_post>  These days the go-to argument by many antivax activists one based on the idea of *body autonomy* as a core human right.

There is an old adage that your right to swing your arm ends where my nose begins. This is a way of saying that rights have limitations: specifically where they infringe upon the rights of others. 

And that, alone, should be enough to quiet vaccination discord. Because being unvaccinated in a pandemic that has brought the world to a shuddering halt is, essentially, swinging your arm around in a crowded room like a five year old child, and acting surprised when there are nosebleeds and disconcerted people around you. 

But I’m more curious about the implication of body autonomy, as a quintessential human right, and how that bleeds over into the philosophy of suicide. 

We’ve all heard the statistic, that every single Golden Gate Bridge jumper who survived says they ‘instantly regretted’ jumping. They say at that moment, they realised every other problem in their life could be fixed, except jumping. 

But the antivax crowd is leaning on the idea of a human right that, by extension, would mean that we should not, and in fact, cannot, help people who want to commit suicide, at any age, for any reason. 

I find that absurd. Especially considering all of the research showing just how impulsive the act of suicide is generally considered by psychologists to be. Something like 90% of suicide survivors do not die from suicide later. Further evidence that it is not a decision they’d make twice. 

While it can’t be denied there are considerable pressures, political and otherwise, pushing an antivax narrative, which is inevitably going to be picked up by some proportion of the population, I think it’s worth addressing what seems at first glance to be the bedrock assumptions behind their logic. 

If we all have the right to suicide, at any time, and this right supercedes all other rights, then the pilot of MH370 was morally superior to someone who gets vaccinated due to a mandate, because his right to suicide was greater than the rights of all of his passengers to life. 

To CMV, I guess I'd need someone to explain a moral system where a Typhoid Mary was the good guy.</original_post>

    <text>Most people can spare a kidney or donate some blood and the donation lists are endless. If people have a right to life, then shouldn't we be able to violate someone's bodily autonomy to force them to donate blood or a kidney to save someone else?

 People might object to this by stating that there is a difference between killing and letting someone die, but we can adjust the hypothetical to account for this. Let's say you caused a car accident that caused someone to be in desperate need of a blood transfusion. You are soley responsible for this person's desperate situation by violating his bodily integrity. Should you be forced to donate your blood to this person?

Most people are opposed to forced donations, and I would agree. Bodily autonomy definitely is a human right just like free speech, freedom of religion etc. Whenever human rights come into conflict you cannot just prioritize one above the other as a general rule. Instead we must take into account all factors of the particular case to determine which right weighs heavier. This means the 'strenght' of bodily autonomy really depends on the situation. The right to have an abortion isn't  the same as wearing a mask, getting vaccinated, or not to donate organs or blood.</text>
