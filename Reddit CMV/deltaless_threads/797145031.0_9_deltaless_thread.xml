    <title>CMV: Capitalism has little to no place in our current world</title>
    <original_poster>s3v3ralmidg3ts</original_poster>
    <original_post>Capitalism was certainly a great boon during the industrial revolution. It spurred the necessary economic development that our worldwide civilization needed to leap into our current state.

That being said, capitalism is doing more harm than good in this era. When things like climate change are significantly tied to corporations, workers being treated as a disposable resource by companies like Amazon, horrendous working conditions being supported by tech companies to mass produce the next iPhone, etc.

Why is capitalism still revered in some circles as the cure all to our problems when that doesn't seem to be the case in practice?</original_post>

    <text>I think the problem is not in capitalism but in the way a goverment is voted into power. The more democratic a country is( = every vote is equal) the less inequality there is, no party can overpower the others without the votes of the people. That way a country is influenced by its people not the other way around. ( example USA: they have the NRA big fan of guns they say everyone is allowed to have a gun even the mentaly ill/unstable. While in Switserland many people also have guns but they have many restrictions on it while in the process of getting one but also once you have a gun. Coincidentally switzerland is mostly a direct democracy.

That is why I think a semi-direct democracy is the best option/replacement.

PS I know my grammer is bad so just point it out and I'll change it.</text>
