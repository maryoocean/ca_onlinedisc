    <title>CMV: Debt forgiveness is one of the stupidest ideas ever conceived</title>
    <original_poster>Ndlaxfan</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'll start this off by saying that I am in my last year of high school, and I will hopefully be attending a school that is about 60k a year. However, I will be graduating with under 5k in debt. I've worked my ass off for scholarships, and so far I've gotten about 205 k paid for. Most of the debt-forgiveness advocates are students who bit off more than they can chew, and will be swimming in piles of debt. If the government completely forgave debts, then they completely dick every financial institution in America. I view it like this: why would you go to an upscale restaurant, gorge yourself with food, and then be pissed off and demand that you can't pay the bill?</original_post>

I don't think so. The government backs Federal student loans. The taxpayers would eat the loss, not the finance companies.

    <text>The [vast majority of student loans](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-private-student-loan-debt-became-a-150-billion-burden-2012-7) are federally guaranteed and/or direct loans ($864 billion in 2012). Private student loan debt by contrast was $150 billion in 2012. 

Federally guaranteed means the government (i.e. taxpayers) eat the loss in case of default.</text>
