    <title>CMV: I dont think Ted Cruz is eligible to be president of the United State</title>
    <original_poster>PuckSR</original_poster>
    <original_post>Kamala Harris was recently selected as Biden's running mate, and it re-sparked a common misunderstanding of the Constitution. The definition of "natural born citizen". Clearly, Kamala Harris is eligible.

John McCain, however, was not so clearly a "natural born citizen" as he had been born in the Panama Canal Zone to two US citizens. It was contentious enough of an issue that the Senate passed a resolution saying he was eligible. Specifically, McCain was born to two US citizens who were overseas at the direct orders of the US govt. If McCain was ineligible then every child born to US servicemembers overseas would be ineligible and most people agreed that this was not the founders intent.

However, Rafael "Ted" Cruz was born to an American and a Cuban while they worked in Canada for a private company. If Ted Cruz is eligible to be a US president, then basically anyone who has a claim to citizenship is eligible, even if they have never lived in the United States.

*Example: A young woman is born in China. Her mother is American, her father is Chinese. She lives her entire life in China, but claims dual citizenship for legal purposes. At the age of 42, she decides to move to the United States. She becomes a popular politician and runs for President, only 14 years after being elected to the US House of Representatives.*

Would she be eligible? This seems like the exact scenario the founders were trying to prevent. Someone with loyalties to another country taking the reins of power of the USA.If Ted Cruz is eligible, then this woman would be eligible. At that point, why wouldn't we extend the presidency to citizens like Arnold Schwarzenegger?

Edit: adjusted for the residency requirement

**For all mentions of the Nationality Act of 1790.**The law, as written in 1790 said the following:

* Only free white males could become citizens
* Provided, that the right of [citizenship](https://immigrationhistory.org/item/1790-nationality-act/#) shall not descend to persons whose fathers have never been resident in the United States

First, we obviously don't still have this law on the books. It was fully and totally cancelled and the phrase about "natural born citizen" was removed. You can't point to a law that is not currently applicable as your definition. They clearly felt the need to define the term, and they later rescinded that definition

Further, I think you could make a strong argument that it only applied to children of the father with that definition. This fits with what I have read of citizenship laws in Europe, which stated that citizenship status descended from the paternal line. (I know this because it was a big controversy when people started raping slaves, as it would make the children citizens and free. Most countries made a law explicitly exempting this rule in the case of slave-master relationships)

**Naturalized vs natural born**

The term naturalized wasn't created until the 1940s, when international travel became much more common. The term presently means "conferred after birth", but that term was not used during prior to that period. In fact, "natural born" was used in the US and the UK to imply a citizen granted citizenship by their birth in the USA.

    <text>Your example is forgetting that the Constitution requires 14 years of US residence to qualify.

If a baby in born in the US but spends his entire life in another country that person is ineligible to be president.

&amp;gt;neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty-five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.</text>

    <text>Thanks, I updated it for that reason. So now she has lived in the US for 14 years and in China for 42 years. Her father is a member of the Politburo</text>

    <text>You'll have to update it again, I'm afraid. Chinese citizens are [not allowed to be dual nationals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_nationality_law).</text>

    <text>I think the point of her example holds, despite the second nationality.  Doesnt actually matter if the character is chinese or french.</text>

    <text>It makes it fairly different to Cruz's case though, no? 

He was dual citizen at birth and renounced his Canadian citizenship to go do his thing in the US. In OP's example, the parents of the woman would have to renounce her American citizenship at birth, then she herself would renounce her *Chinese* citizenship at a certain age and... apply for naturalization in the US? Be automatically recognized as a US citizen? I'm not exactly sure how that would work tbh.</text>

    <text>Are you really unable to understand the example because she used chinese instead of french or Canadian?  I mean, OP isnt talking about naturalization, she (he?) Is talking about dual citizenship and picked a country fairly at random and very different than the US.  If someone has dual citizenship and grows up on Mars, but moves to the US as an adult for 14 years to run for president, is that person eligible?  The where doesnt matter.</text>

    <text>The perfect ratio of battery acid to cereal in a bowl is around 2:1. Do you agree?</text>
