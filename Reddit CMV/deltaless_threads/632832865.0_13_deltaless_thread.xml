    <title>CMV: Now that we have evolved past the need to eat meat, it is completely immoral to do so.</title>
    <original_poster>Inquisitive2k</original_poster>
    <original_post>Not a vegan or even a vegetarian, but I still hold this belief. I understand that we have evolved as carnivores, and that eating meat has always been essential to human survival. It holds nutrients you cant find anywhere else like B12, its heavily saturated which makes it an efficient food, and ot tastes damn good (which i would guess has something to do with evolution aswel).

These arguments are still valid in underdeveloped or poor countries, and under extreme conditions. However, in modern day western society's I can't seem to find one ethical argument for eating meat (not to mention the toll it takes on the environment). 

Is everyone just lazy like me, or is there more to it?</original_post>

This is incorrect.  We evolved as omnivores and if we were herbivorous now, then we'd have evolved past the need to eat meat.  I think what you're talking about is we have developed enough viable alternatives to meat and it's nutrients that it's possible to be 100% herbivorous in practice.  This statement is correct, but it's choice based, not evolution based.

Whether or not it's moral is an entirely different question.  Afterall, we didn't choose to be born into an omnivorous species, it simply happened that way.  Since we are omnivorous the ideal of shifting us to be herbivorous in practice is pointless from a practical perspective.  If we think it's immoral to eat meat, then the focus should be on producing meat like alternatives that would be acceptable to the vast majority of society.  Currently we aren't there.  Until we have alternatives that are just as good as the real thing it's not immoral since there aren't any equivalent alternatives.</text>
