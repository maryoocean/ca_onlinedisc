    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>French schools have both "Christmas Holiday" and "All Saints Holiday" so Christianity is plenty integrated. They only ban religious clothing because this isn't a christian tradition, so they can go after muslims under the cover of seculatism. (This targets jews too, but I guess this is considered collateral damage.)</text>

    <text>Most muslims have pre-Islam tradition or rituals ingrained in their countries, they do not consider them a sin or idolatry or being biased, since it has dilluted to social-cultural expressions.</text>
