    <title>CMV: Killing baby cows for food is no more immoral than killing adult cows for food.</title>
    <original_poster>Arandur</original_poster>
    <original_post>Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world. Given that killing animals for food is not generally immoral^1 ,  there is not such a great difference between the experience of a baby cow and an adult cow that one will experience death any differently than the other; neither is the life of a cow so rich and fulfilling^2 that it's immoral to deprive a baby cow of it before it dies.

Therefore, I should not feel any worse eating veal than I do eating a hamburger.

^1 If you disagree with this, that's a different argument entirely; I'm glad to hear your opinion on the matter, but you won't change my view unless your argument assumes this point.

^2 Just the opposite, presently; the lives of cows are full of pain and discomfort, because our (American) food-raising process is horrifying. I *do* think that this is unethical, just based on the principle that pain is a bad thing, but it's not a massive priority for me because I think the amount of human suffering is significantly greater at this time than the amount of animal suffering (due to the greater capacity of a human to experience suffering). Again, this isn't the topic of my CMV, but if you want to give your opinion on the matter I'd be glad to hear it.

    <text>This isn't meant to CYV at all, but I'm curious.

Do you think the deliciosity of an animal in any way factors into the morality of eating it?

Take two animals. Different species. One is, all else being equal, kind of mediocre to eat. But the other is absolutely delicious in general. Is it even slightly 'less bad' to eat the delicious one in your view?</text>

    <text>I do! Only slightly, but from a value utilitarian standpoint one gets greater utility from eating the delicious animal than the non-delicious one. 

If there are other factors, though, like the delicious animal having to be killed in a particularly cruel way, then the disutility is very likely to outweigh the utility from deliciousness. After all, spices are a thing. </text>

    <text>Oh sure, I understand about the cruel methods. But okay. One more question, I promise - again, just because I'm curious.

Does that therefore mean that individuals who find the flesh of animals to not taste good (again, all else being equal) are of more value than ones who actually think they're tasty, on your view?</text>

    <text>No, not at all. o_o People are worth what they contribute to the world, not what the world gives to them. </text>

    <text>Right, but you made a reference to disutility - a particularly cruel method of preparing an animal for being eaten is worse than other ways. An individual human is going to have tastes and inclinations which themselves, or so I'd think, have or imply some utility versus disutility. Put another way, the person who thinks meat is delicious seems to contribute (potentially or actually) more disutility than someone whose tastes are vegetarian. Even if they can resist it, they're denying themselves something they like - more discomfort in the world.

Does this simply not factor in for you?</text>
