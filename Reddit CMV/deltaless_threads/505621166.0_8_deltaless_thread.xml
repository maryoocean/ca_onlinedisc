    <title>CMV: Activists should abandon the phrase "white privilege" because it alienates white people who didn't grow up wealthy</title>
    <original_poster>ShiningConcepts</original_poster>
    <original_post>Blacks are [more than twice as likely to grow up in poverty](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;amp;sortModel=%7B"colId":"Location","sort":"asc"%7D), [disproportionately sentenced for the same crimes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/16/black-men-sentenced-to-more-time-for-committing-the-exact-same-crime-as-a-white-person-study-finds/?utm_term=.b0e81ca325dc), [several percentage points ahead in terms of unemployment statistics](https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpsee_e16.htm), prone disproportionately to police arrests incl. for nonviolent drug usage, and the list goes on. There are a wide variety of issues minority rights activists bring up that are legitimate - I'm not here to dispute those. I fully support that fight.

My view here is that the usage of the phrase "white privilege" is wrong and should be retired. Many upper class white people are privileged as they are immune to the ripple effects of a racist history (and the modern day effects of racist police departments and shitty schools in minority neighborhoods). But for the poor white ones, which there are many, the phrase white privilege should be abandoned. Because it minimizes and implies less importance for the suffering countless poor white people had to go through - while blacks are disproportionately victims of all the things i mentioned, some whites are the victims of them to.

I understand why a white person who suffered hardship in their life would feel alienated by hearing someone throw around the term "white privilege" - the term asserts there is a privilege in being white. There is privilege in being rich, but not solely in being white. So, the term should be abandoned in the interest of not alienating poor white people from a legitimate movement that has legitimate concerns.

    <text>I actually agree with you somewhat but I'm going to present a different reason and say that the term white privilege should be retired because it masks the fact whether some is saying "hey white people get X privileges and that should be considered in terms of whats best for everybody" versus "white people are sucky oppressors"

Because you're quite right, poor white people don't experience much privilege and in some respects can't find any support in their identity (not saying this makes it worse for poor white individuals but just pointing out how they are a little lost) - but I think whats important is trying to find language and dialogue that brings people together. To be honest I'm tidied of people talking about "culture" wars and I think the real silent majority are just average people of all kinds who want a good balance between tackling issues and just getting on with it. 

So yeah I think some term that emphasizes the advantages without sounding like a racial pogrom would be good, something like "majority advantage" or "Person the system serves" (JK) or something    </text>
