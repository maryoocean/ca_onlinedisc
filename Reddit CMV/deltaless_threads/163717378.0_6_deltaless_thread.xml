    <title>CMV: Debt forgiveness is one of the stupidest ideas ever conceived</title>
    <original_poster>Ndlaxfan</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'll start this off by saying that I am in my last year of high school, and I will hopefully be attending a school that is about 60k a year. However, I will be graduating with under 5k in debt. I've worked my ass off for scholarships, and so far I've gotten about 205 k paid for. Most of the debt-forgiveness advocates are students who bit off more than they can chew, and will be swimming in piles of debt. If the government completely forgave debts, then they completely dick every financial institution in America. I view it like this: why would you go to an upscale restaurant, gorge yourself with food, and then be pissed off and demand that you can't pay the bill?</original_post>

    <text>Part of the debt forgiveness conversation is the idea of another economic stimulus.  People with less debt (either through debt forgiveness or a reduction in the interest being charged) will spend more.  And, despite stereotypes about Underwater Basket Weaving or other degrees which didn't translate to "real world jobs", plenty of engineers, doctors, and scientists are also weighed down by massive debt.

And what will these people spend their money on?  Well, housing ownership and car ownership among young people are at their lowest in decades.  Young people without dependents should be some of the most financially active people in the economy, but they're often paying as much in student loans as they are rent.  Giving young, educated people the economic freedom to take chances or be better consumers will actually help the economy.</text>
