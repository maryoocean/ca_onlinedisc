    <title>CMV: People forgo their right to complain if they never do anything about it</title>
    <original_poster>ooselfie</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have a few friends that complain about their life ALL the time. I hear things like:

"My job sucks, I'm miserable here"

"God school sucks, I'm studying something so uninteresting"

I think they have total control - it comes down to laziness, or perhaps they don't even really want anything to happen. It is so easy to put in some extra effort in your day to make things happen for yourself. They complain and complain but never do anything to change. It's like the boy who cried wolf. 

If you constantly complain, but do nothing to mend the problem, then you shouldn't be allowed to complain.

    <text>1) Sometimes the most powerful thing that you can provide is a voice

2) Some situations are unchangeable. 

3) Some situations are changeable but at a cost which is too high to be seriously considered. I despise the winters and my depression gets really, really bad between November and April. But moving south would mean pretty much never seeing my grade-school sister again, so I don't.

4) Sometimes you are correct, but it's not all the time.</text>
