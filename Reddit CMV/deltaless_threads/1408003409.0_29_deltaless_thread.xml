    <title>CMV: Average men do not have a good chance of having sex with women.</title>
    <original_poster>fitness35754745</original_poster>
    <original_post>My lady friends husband has had a threesome before and they are looking into being able to do it again.

This guy is 6 foot 3.

For me I'm only average sized. 5 foot 9 which an average penis of 5.5 inches length and 4.8 inches girth. My looks are also average only too I would say. However I would say my personality is good towards friends, I've managed to get my lady friend to open up to me about talking about her sexual experiences so I must be doing something right. (No flirting just friends talking, I'm lucky to have a friend like her)

I'm super insecure about this and this has kept me from sleeping. I'm not exsactly worried about having threesomes or often sex, I just feel quite inferior for not.

Do average guys really have a chance with this type of thing? I cant help but feel this guys height (and possible above average penis size) is making women consider sleeping with him more. Do I have atleast a good chance? I believe I dont and that I'm at a very big disadvantage. 

I know from fair studies that the preferred penis size is bigger than average and I'm sure the preferred height for a man is above average too. I'm more worried about penis size because well, it can change the plessure the women recieves no matter good or bad.</original_post>

    <text>Man, some advice.  Stop worrying about what other people got between their legs and how long their bones are.  That has absolutely nothing to do with you.  

Be you the way you feel comfortable being you.  You're going to get what you're going to get and be happy about it.  Do not try to change your ways to suit other people, it's a fruitless and exhaustive effort, and will only end in severe disappointment.  

Everyone is born with positives and negatives.  Some people are good looking and shitty people, and some are okay looking and great people.  Embrace your positives and keep going down the road and people will appreciate who you are and will gravitate towards you.  You are okay the way you are.</text>
