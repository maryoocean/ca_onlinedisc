    <title>I dont think manslaughter or any crime committed accidentally should be considered a crime. At all. CMV</title>

    <original_post>If it is proven that the offender had no intention of committing a crime, why should they be persecuted because the odds were against them? 


EDIT: Ok, many people have used the example of "what if a person is driving drunk and they kill someone?" I still think they should only be punished for driving drunk.</original_post>

    <text>I get where you're coming from and it's not fair, but overall society would have a hard time functioning if we allowed people to recklessly injure others without consequence. Keep in mind that not all accidentally caused death is punishable. It's only when you cause death when you're doing something *you shouldn't have been doing in the first place.* So it's partially a matter of luck, but not purely so. For example, a friend of mine killed a cyclist with her van. She was driving reasonably, and the cyclist was drunk and in a place he should not have been. It was ruled that my friend did nothing wrong, and she was not charged or punished at all. </text>
