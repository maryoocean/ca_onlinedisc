    <title>CMV:Freedom of speech should not be limited</title>
    <original_poster>shad0w-fax</original_poster>
    <original_post>I strongly believe that freedom of speech and expression must have no limits. Even in case if the speech is offensive to people. One can choose not to listen but not to take away my right to say it. Before someone suggest the "fire in a theatre",I recently came across with this speech of Christopher Hitchens and would recommend you to watch it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z2uzEM0ugY)
One big question is-who will be the one deciding that what is and isn't right to say? Who would you give authority to decide for you what is and isn't right to think and say?
Obviously, it is not an ideal case. Of course the best way is to have a perfect individual to make these decisions but, have we not seen that at last it always ends badly. That kind of authority would be tyrannical.
I would like to give analogy of democracy being imperfect as compared to a benevolent dictator BUT we know dictatorship always end badly. No one person should be given so much power.

    <text>&amp;gt;One big question is-who will be the one deciding that what is and isn't right to say?

The big assumption made by people, mostly conservatives due to their views on government structure, is that laws are meant to solve issues once and for all and forever.  They're not.  There's no replacing democracy and citizen input.  Just because there's a question of who will decide anything doesn't mean we can't attempt anything.

People who say that we can't use offensive speech are wrong.  Hate speech is protected by the law.  It's hate speech that's threatening in very obvious ways that's not protected.

Giving people the ability to say to another human being, "I am going to rape you" is giving them the ability to say that to terrorize someone and *not* face consequences, even if they said it just to frighten them.  If you were to tell someone you would physical assault them with no intention, the other person can't be sure.

Instances of private citizens or organizations determining that you can't say something is also protected by freedoms of speech.  If a company fires you for a joke that was actually hilarious but made them uncomfortable, that's just how it is unfortunately.</text>
