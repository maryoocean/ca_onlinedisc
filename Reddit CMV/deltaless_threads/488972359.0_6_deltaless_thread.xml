    <title>CMV: There is no reason to refuse to sign a pre-nup unless your reasons for marriage are corrupt to begin with.</title>
    <original_poster>dumbbuttloserface</original_poster>
    <original_post>I know that a lot of people view pre-nups as “insurance” in the case of divorce. And I get it. If someone is entering into a marriage with a LOT of capital, and the other person comes from significantly less, it makes sense to want to make sure that what’s yours, stays yours. 

But I think a lot of people (at least in media portrayals and stories from friends) are very against the idea of signing one and I don’t get it. If you love someone and you intend to be married to them forever, a pre-nup is essentially pointless. To me, it only seems like you would refuse to/be adverse to sign a pre-nup if you’re marrying someone because you see the relationship as potentially beneficial for you in the case of a divorce. 

I’m interested in hearing anyone’s opinion, but particularly the opinions of those who have been in this situation, i.e. the one asking for the pre-nup or the one being asked. Thank you!!

EDIT: I’ve awarded 3 deltas on this post so far because of some very valid points. The most convincing of which was that a prenup compels the person signing to be in a potentially extremely difficult and even dangerous position in the case of abuse. Someone else provided me with a very convincing analogy which put the whole issue in a new light for me. A third person suggested the possibility of an unfair prenup; I understand why you would not sign one, however, after re-negotiating the terms to a place where both parties can be satisfied with the prenup, it would then make no sense to continue to refuse to sign. And if the person asking for a prenup refuses to compromise on unfair terms, you probably shouldn’t be marrying them in the first place, imho. 

Ultimately, my personal experience has shaped my view so that I have no issue with signing a prenup with my partner, but I do see now that the issue is much more multi-faceted than I had previously believed. I suppose my view on the subject now is: there is no reason not to sign a prenup if the terms are satisfactory to both parties and there is room for a discussion between the couple. If your SO refuses to compromise on any point or even engage in a discussion about the terms, you probably shouldn’t be marrying them in the first place as they clear don’t see you as an equal. 

So I guess...view shifted/expanded, but not altogether changed. </original_post>

    <text>They could also be refusing to sign it because there's no need for it; the marriage isn't happening. Lol. 

Suggesting a prenup is a sign of mistrust and some people don't want to marry someone that doesn't trust them. They'd question their partners motives for even marrying them to begin with. </text>

    <text>If they want to be together forever, why is marriage crossing their minds? The whole point of marriage is to create a social contract/norm that makes it financially and socially costly to split up. You have a big party and make a big public commitment to stay together and divorce is very embarrassing. The legal and financial difficulties of divorce make it even less appealing. If people were able to stay with the people they said they would love forever, they wouldn't need marriage to coerce them, they would just stay together. But people are fickle and short sited, they often act impulsively and need checks on their behavior which is what a marriage provides.

To me, a women who insists on marriage as the ultimate conclusion of a dating relationship is telegraphing major insecurity. She is saying that she doesn't believe a guy when he says he wants to be with her, she needs a financial/social/legal/ promise that he will, that seems pretty insecure to me.



People get married because they want an assurance someone will stay with them, they are implicitly acknowledging the possibility of breaking up when they use the tool that is marriage to try to ensure they will stay together, its just that we have interlined this norm and don't notice it anymore.</text>

    <text>Interestingly enough not being willing to discuss and sign a fair prenup shows you aren't worthy of trust and should be distrusted.</text>

    <text>dude exactly! and that’s what i don’t get! like, each party has to look out for themselves. the person asking for the prenup wants to make sure the other isn’t just seeking to gain assets in the case of a divorce. you hear all the time stories about how the person who enters the marriage with less ends up getting everything (or a whole hell of a lot) in the divorce. 

i feel like no one is going into a marriage planning to get divorced unless they have an ulterior motive! i mean, in america, half of all marriages end in divorce! like literal 50/50 shot! every marriage is a gamble! i don’t see why it’s wrong to want some sort of back up plan. </text>
