    <title>CMV: Picky eaters deserve more respect and shouldn’t be shamed for being picky</title>
    <original_poster>UsualMorning98</original_poster>
    <original_post>It’s not always the picky eater’s fault they’re picky. It could be due to how they were raised (not their fault), trauma or sensory issues with food (something that can be really hard to work through) and many other factors.

A lot of them either try their best to make things easier for “regular” eaters (bringing their own food to events, looking at the menu beforehand, ordering from the kid’s menu, simply not eating that meal/day etc) or feel extreme guilt when they can’t accommodate to those who will shame them.

I’m not saying they should be prioritised over people with allergies or those with other food needs (like vegetarians or those who don’t eat certain foods for religious reasons). But they deserve a little more respect and support because it’s also hard for them being picky eaters. Definitely prioritise food issues that could harm someone. But once that’s sorted, don’t get mad at the picky eaters for just trying to exist.</original_post>

    <text>Nah. Picky eaters that are adults should act as adults. Being a picky eater may be blamed on parents if you are a child, otherwise its generally infantile and quite priviledged. I’m sure that there are those with specific food traumas that have a valid excuse for being a picky eater, certainly not the nes that I know, who are picky eaters because they are infantile and priviledged. It can also be an indication of personalities that are unwilling to change, overcome, trust others, or admit that they were wrong. 
Whilst shaming is generally wrong, in relative terms, picky eating should be shamed, and I certainly am ashamed of being a picky eater when I am - for example I struggle with eating organs as a meat eater, but I know that i shouldn’t and I actively try to learn to enjoy it.</text>
