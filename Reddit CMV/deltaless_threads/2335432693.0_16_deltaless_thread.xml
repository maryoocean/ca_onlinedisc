    <title>CMV: all (US) roads that are not highways between cities or states should only have a single, one-way, lane of civilian traffic or less.</title>

    <original_post>The main reasoning for my argument is because there at this point has been consistent, replicated, research finding that the more roads you add, the more traffic is actually _increased._ It would be a rough transition at first, but in theory, traffic would be diminished if you cut down the number of roads and the number of lanes. This would be great for the environment but it also would be great for everyone driving because there would be less traffic. The lanes that are no longer in use could be used to improve our society in a number of ways. They could be made into trees or park area. They could be restricted to only delivery vehicles and/or public transit or emergency vehicles. Or they could be made into bike paths. And if all goes well, perhaps people would even be open to eliminating some roads for civilian traffic all together.

Edit: Again, to reiterate, according to all the current research, more roads actually _create_ more traffic. So if anything, this would reduce traffic, maybe not immediately, but over time. A lot of people seem to not have read that part, so I'm not going to respond to repeats of people who clearly did not read my argument.

    <text>I'm going to ignore the environmental impact, because even though I presume that's the happy positive side-effect you're actually aiming for, it's not the main point you're making.

The crux of your argument is that the economic phenomenon of induced demand proves that more roads create more traffic (and the opposite must also be true.) But the unspoken part of your argument is that people would be happier without traffic ignoring that it is self evident that most people prefer sitting in traffic to less convenient alternatives, which are already available to them.

The reason induced demand works here is because it makes it cheaper (more convenient, less time, all of these things comprise "cheaper") to drive. The only way your plan works is by making people's preferences so expensive they eventually determine that it would be cheaper to do their less preferred alternative. You're basically making driving such an expensive (again, time, price, convenience) commodity that nobody can do it, let alone want to.

The fact is, people don't actually mind traffic all that much and GREATLY prefer it to the alternatives that would have to be used for your proposal to work. We know this because people drive and sit in traffic and bitch about it instead of using alternatives when available.</text>
