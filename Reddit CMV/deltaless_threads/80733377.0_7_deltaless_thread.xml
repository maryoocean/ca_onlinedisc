    <original_post>99% of jobs I've held have required drug screening at random or as an initial condition of employment.  I think that all adults who receive welfare should be subjected to the same screening process.  This should be a federal addendum to all state welfare programs.</original_post>

Speaking as an European, that feels like something North Korea would do, not like something that belongs in the civilized world.

You're into "they're doing something bad to me, they should do something bad to others as well" kind of reasoning, and that's not a way to build good society.</text>

That's not true at all.  I'm into responsible use of tax payer dollars and protecting the members of our society who are truly interested in using welfare to elevate themselves kind of reasoning.</text>
