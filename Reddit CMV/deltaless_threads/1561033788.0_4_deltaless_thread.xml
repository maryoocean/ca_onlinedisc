    <title>CMV: Pregnant women should be automatically registered to donate their afterbirths for stem cell research (with an opt-out option).</title>
    <original_poster>Ragdoll_Proletariat</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm a Catholic and my father received stem cell treatment a few years ago. It massively improved his quality of life. I learned shortly beforehand that a woman's afterbirth and its core blood contains a lot of stem cells which can be used, to the point that women can actually donate them. I think this should be made an automatic process because of the following reasons:

1. There's no religious debate about harming an embryo because the baby has already been born, meaning that Christian women could help move this forward.
2. Afterbirths normally go in the bin which is a waste of stem cells.
3. Most women don't know this is an option so wouldn't opt into it.

I believe this would hasten research opportunities and consequently medical developments.

I write this with the caveat that women who want to eat it/frame it/etc can opt out in the same way as with UK organ donation. I'm not a doctor of course so I'm wondering if there's anything I'm missing here. I'm interested in seeing people's thoughts on this.</original_post>

    <text>It seems to me that the argument for or against this relies on the bodily autonomy argument.  If you think someone should have bodily autonomy over their body after death (as in, they are no longer using their body and so you want organ donation to be opt-in) then this should absolutely be opt-in.  If you think someone should not have bodily autonomy over their body after death, then this could be opt-out (although I would argue that a living person has more claim over the parts separated from them than a dead person).</text>

    <text>You can set it up so that you have quite a bit of time to opt-out. Most people get their driver's license very early in their life and you could add this as a sub item of the donor question. 

Swapping an opt-in for an opt-out at this point still gives most people decades in which to refuse to donate, not to mention at the time that they apply for the license.</text>

    <text>I think my main thing is that it's not as intrusive as the focus of most bodily autonomy debates because it's not something you would normally keep. I'm kind of equating it mentally with if I went to hospital with another sickness and they said, "By the way, we're going to keep your pussy old bandages unless you don't want us to." It's a bit gross but if it's going in the bin anyway, I'd rather it helped somebody. The flaw in that analogy of course is that you tend to only have one afterbirth in nine month whereas you might go through half a tub of tissues a day, at which point it becomes impractical.</text>

    <text>I think it's interesting that your own example is opt-in.

But further, I think that if hospitals were simply keeping bandages to perform tests on them/the blood and whatnot without telling patients, there absolutely would be an uproar when it was found out.</text>
