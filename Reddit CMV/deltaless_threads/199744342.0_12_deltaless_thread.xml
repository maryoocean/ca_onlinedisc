    <title>CMV: Giving other cultures sh*t about eating dog meat is hypocritical</title>
    <original_poster>simobk</original_poster>
    <original_post>Hi all,

So someone just posted a video on my FB feed about [the Yulin dog meat festival](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=yulin+dog+meat+festival). It is horrifying...

For the purpose of this CMV, let's forget about how it's done (the way they get the dogs, they treat them... etc.) and concentrate **only** on the dog meat eating part.

I love dogs, and yes, I find it horrifying that other cultures eat them. However, I also understand that for other cultures, it is horrifying to see us eat beef or pork.

In my opinion, the only situation where you are allowed to complain is if you are talking about eating animal meat in general. But if you enjoy eating a good steak, then it is hypocritical to criticize others for eating what they consider is "just meat".

Again, I am stressing the fact that this is not about the *animal cruelty* part. It's just about the meat eating. For the sake of this CMV, let's suppose that the animals are bred and slaughtered in the most humane possible way.

So... CMV

    <text>How about an argument of moral efficiency? One cow can provide a lot more meat than a handful of dogs.

There are plenty of good responses here mate. The only reason dogs are eaten is because of tradition from when a bunch of asian people had nothing but dirt and dogs to eat.</text>

    <text>following your train of though, then it will be better to eat plants since it's a lot more efficient than eating a cow or a dog, right?</text>

    <text>Sure, but I still need protein and flavor (soy and tofu are terrible), and from experience dog tastes pretty bad compared to beef. I wouldnt be opposed to eating lab grown beef.</text>

    <text>Where do you suppose herbivores get their protein?</text>

    <text>I don't know I'm not a biologist/nutritionist. The internet doesn't have a consistent answer either. Nuts and seeds is one answer. Apparently humans and other non herbivores can't synthesize certain proteins so we need to eat meat.

But herbivores graze too. Meaning they eat all day. I personally am not interested in eating a ton of plant material all day.</text>
