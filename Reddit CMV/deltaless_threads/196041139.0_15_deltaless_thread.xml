    <title>CMV: "White trash" is an offensive slur, and should not be tolerated in society just as we do not tolerate other bigoted slurs.</title>
    <original_poster>JSmurfington</original_poster>
    <original_post>This has bothered me for a while. The term "white trash" or "trailer trash" fits all the criteria for being a slur which should not be widely acceptable for use. But I have heard the term dropped casually in conversation, and no one seems to treat it like the slur that it is.

It is a term that denigrates and stereotypes a group of people based on their race, appearance, and socioeconomic status. It is meant to be derogatory. This to me is the definition of a bigoted term.

I'm not arguing that the term has as much history behind it as other racial or bigoted slurs. But in our modern society, we should still abandon the term altogether.

    <text>It is what it is.  Perhaps rather than being offended with the term "white trash", we should accept it and expand it to include "black trash" and "hispanic trash" and "asian trash".

There are those across all ethnicities who do not aspire to achieve and whose moral/cultural decisions are of low quality.  It is not a racial issue, rather it is one of lifestyle and values.  Whether it is a white person in a trailer park, a black thug in the ghetto, a gang member in LA, or a lowlife in some Chinatown, they are what they are, and they are trash.</text>
