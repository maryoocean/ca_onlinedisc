    <title>CMV: Web 3.0 is just a Zoomer's realization that "Punk" was a subculture that existed before they did.</title>

    <original_post>All Web 3.0 is a call to decentralize the digital ecosystems that were built in Web 2.0. Instead of using Google and Facebook, users will create their own digital ecosystems. Hmm sounds a lot like the punk subculture that rejected postmodernism and consumerism in the 80s and 90s. 

Don't buy CD's. Make your own vinyl records! Don't buy music. Make your own music! Don't buy food. Grow your own food! I swear, Bill Maher is right when he accuses Zoomers of being the generation that thinks nobody ever lived before they did. 

Web 3.0 is just catchy nonsense that explains how YOU CAN TOO build your own digital ecosystem away from the prying eyes and centralized control of BIG TECH. Well, sure, you could do that. IF you were a programmer that was so inclined AND had a lot of disposal income to build your own digital ecosystems. There's a reason why Google and Facebook exist and most people use them: because they can't or don't want to create their own products all the time. 

Web 3.0 just seems to be a scammy premise that promises that people can "decentralize" the internet and own their own data and blah blah blah. That's not how it works. You're never going to "own" your personal data unless you essentially become a digital version of an Amish person who never uses the internet unless it's in their own homemade ecosystem. 

Also, as more and more actors move into the space to create their own ecosystems disconnected from "big tech", there will be a power law distribution on who consolidates power and influence with those new ecosystems. In effect, you're trading Google or Facebook for another 3rd party...a 3rd party which will STILL have centralized control over your data and use of their system as a customer. And no, blockchain (which is just a lame version of SQL) isn't going to solve for this. There will always be a party that acts as a controller for the data and systems that make up the ecosystem. Doesn't matter if it's Google, Facebook, or your whatever new Web 3.0 platform becomes the next player.

Again, this all just sounds like the Punk subculture that advocated a DIY ethos. Tell me the difference between the punk subculture and the Zoomer's wet dream of a "decentralized internet" a la "Web 3.0".

Go ahead and change my view but please spare me any lofty generalized nonsense about how Web 3.0 will cure cancer and save the whales.</original_post>

    <text>It's a punk concept, but just like like the subculture, it's not practical...and it's already been bastardized and commercialized.</text>

    <text>It is not punk at all. It is tech jive marketing that is basically selling the illusory promise of information security to raise venture capital funds that will be used to fool idiots into buying an inflated IPO that will then be used to set up selling out to Facebook after which they will live a lavish lifestyle until they OD on “cocagra” a mix of cocaine and viagra only available on Richard Branson’s sex island.</text>

    <text>So we're in agreement on Web 3.0.

I think we're talking past each other with the punk categorization. But we agree that web 3.0 is dogshit masquerading as a chocolate bar.</text>

We’re still in disagreement that “Web 3.0” has any relationship whatsoever to punk except as being antithetical to anything it stands for.</text>
