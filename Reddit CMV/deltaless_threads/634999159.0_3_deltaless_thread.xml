    <title>CMV: There is no position on either side of the US immigration policy debate that makes any damn sense.</title>

    <original_post>Sure, the extremists in most debates don’t make sense, that’s normal. In this case, extreme conservatives want mass deportations of all illegal aliens, and extreme liberals want wide open borders where all are welcomed without limit. Either extreme seems clear it would be a disaster.

But what would a reasonable moderate (or slightly liberal) position be? I can’t think of one! Here’s how I currently interpret our balance:

* yes, we need at least some border security, we can’t just let people slip past the border checkpoints whenever they want.

* however, if you do successfully sneak past our border security, congratulations, you made it! We don’t like to deport people once they start setting down roots, so welcome aboard!

* therefore, we should have moderate border security that stops some people, but we will sort of look the other way sometimes too.

Letting people stay based on how successfully and for how long they evade the law seems like nonsense to me, but I can’t think of a better way. Is there one?</original_post>

    <text>The trick is to look from a consequences perspective. Say there was a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants (however long you make it). If the result if this was more income bring reported and taxed for example, it seems like a good outcome.

Plus, unless the constitution gets amended, anyone born in the US is a citizen, and citizens can petition for their parents to immigrate to America. So that just encourages so called, 'anchor babies.'

Lastly it's worth noting that sensible boarder protection is an option (for example a 'virtual wall' using drones).</text>
