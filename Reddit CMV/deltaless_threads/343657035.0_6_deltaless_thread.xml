    <title>CMV: U.S. Expenditures on defense is why there is so few terrorist attacks</title>

    <original_post>On Reddit the U.S. gets a lot of flak for spending so much on its defense budget. People often use the argument "[some uncommon event] kills more people a year than terrorists." I argue that this is because of our massive intelligence and military capabilities. Another hot button issue on Reddit seems to be the use of drones and many will argue that our drone program makes more enemies than it kills. Although I do recognize the flaws with our drone program I believe stopping is not a solution and the drone program weakens the capabilities of terrorists networks to effectively plan attacks. I subscribe to the "peace means carrying a big stick" philosophy. Change my view on American defense spending and drones.  </original_post>

    <text>We create a lot of terrorists. 

We have been bombing countries and sometimes we get the terrorist and sometimes we get the guy waiting in line for a sandwich. 

If bombing stopped terrorism than it would have been stopped a long time ago. 

We have bombed the shit out of ISIS and they still are able to conduct major attacks against targets in Europe. 


Per this idea, the actions of our military in Iraq should have stopped terrorism in that area, but our actions lead to more terrorism. 

It is hard to kill an idea. You can't bomb ideas. </text>
