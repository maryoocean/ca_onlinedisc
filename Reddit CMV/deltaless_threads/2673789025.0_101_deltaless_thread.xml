    <title>CMV: The notion that the Democrats or Republicans "must" run Biden or Trump "because there are no other viable candidates" is ridiculous. There are thousands of people who would make better presidential candidates for 2024 than Biden or Trump.</title>

    <original_post>Every argument for Biden or Trump to run in 2024 boils down to some version of "status quo" or "inertia." We're told that the Ds and Rs have no choice but to run these super-old candidates because there's nobody else who could be suitable.

&amp;#x200B;

In a nation of 332,000,000 people, there are well over 100 million who are over the age of 35, American-born, and have resided in the United States for 14 years or more - in other words, are constitutionally eligible to run for president.

Out of those 100 million, surely at least half have a basic education, are mature, sensible, decent people, and have demonstrated solid character - and also be significantly younger than Trump or Biden.

Out of those 50 million, surely at least ten million would qualify as *highly* educated - the metrics of which can be tricky to figure out (is it a master's degree? or something else?) - but they would be significantly above average.

Out of those 10 million, surely at least one million would be quite exceptional - people who have substantially high IQ, have advanced quite far in life and a career - such as being a doctor, or having worked in public governmental service for decades, etc.

And out of those million, surely at least 10,000 would have the political know-how, the charisma, the political interest, maybe have spent significant time abroad in foreign countries or speak multiple languages, to be a suitable president.

In fact, even in Congress, state legislatures or governorships alone, there must be dozens of good, qualified, educated, experienced politicians who would be much younger than Trump or Biden, and who would make suitable presidential candidates. 

So, CMV on this one. I don't buy for one moment the notion that, in a nation of 332 million people, America somehow has no choice but to run Biden vs. Trump in 2024 because "we've got no one else who'd be a good candidate."  </original_post>

    <text>It’s not that there are no better qualified candidates.  It’s just that people don’t vote for a candidate based on quality.  A candidate attracts a vote due to character traits that a voting block values, which usually reflect the ethical principles of a voting block.  It doesn’t even matter if the candidate doesn’t even embody the character traits that his fans believe he has. All that matters is that enough people believe it to vote for him. Trump will be the GOP nominee because the party has become a cult of personality around him, so it’s impossible for any Republican voter to consider any other candidate and remain in that party. Biden will be the nominee for Democrats because the Democratic voting base has decided in the aggregate that he’s good enough of a representative of their values, all other factors notwithstanding.  You actually saw this play out in the 2020 Democratic primaries where there were many candidates that were clearly more competent than Biden.  I suspect that the country was just exhausted by the political fights between the parties and just wanted to return to the Obama days. Biden was VP under Obama so he came to be identified as a kind of stand-in for him.  Obama was a charismatic president and like I said, people vote for character and values more than competence.</text>
