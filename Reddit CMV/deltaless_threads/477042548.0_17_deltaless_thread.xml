    <title>CMV: God could be either benevolent or omnipotent, but not both.</title>
    <original_poster>TaterTotsBandit</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have yet to see an argument that adequately explains the existence of suffering in the face of a benevolent, omnipotent God.

Provided God were both of these things, it wouldn't have created suffering in the first place. There wouldn't have been a need. To say that a God had to necessarily do something makes it no longer omnipotent.

I often see people say that suffering serves a purpose, such as bringing us closer to God or giving life meaning.

But once again, if the God were both benevolent and omnipotent, suffering wouldn't have had to be created in the first place. An emotion humans perceive as positive could just as easily take its place. If you claim otherwise, then that God is either no longer omnipotent or no longer benevolent.

No longer omnipotent because it can't get rid of a negative emotion, no longer benevolent because it can and chooses not to.


Edit 1: my opinion hasn't been changed but I've learned new concepts and been introduced to some novel ones, so the thread was still a success!!!

I decided to stop answer as most responses are currently bringing up free will, but the concept of that is for another thread entirely. 

I respect what others are saying, but i feel like ones conclusions about free will and the benevolence of creation is completely experience based. As such, I don't see a point in arguing over it as you can't change someone's life experience.

I'm still reading the responses, and will answer any that I feel I didn't address elsewhere in the thread.

Thank you all for your responses!

Edit 2: upon answering (I hope) every comment so far, it seems free will is more closely tied to benevolence than I'd originally realized. So I'll make a separate thread about that once I make my thoughts up on it (free will is one of those things that scare me, lol, so give me time pls).</original_post>

    <text>Here you have to be careful not to create your own “purpose for existence on earth” and impose that purpose as gods purpose for creating earth and putting sentient life on it. 

If God’s purpose was to create a place that is pain free then yes, earth either doesn’t qualify or is a failure.  However, if god had some other purpose, such as creating a place for us to experience a mortality with free agency, and that we were to use this time to learn, develop, grow, etc., then pain and suffering could very well be an integral part of that process.  And god, having an eternal perspective, knows that suffering on earth, will not only eventually be compensated to each of us in the next phase of our journey, but is also necessary for our eternal progression. 

I’m trying to keep this slightly ambiguous as I don’t want it to come across as any particular religion.  This view holds in a number of religious though (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism to a degree). </text>
