    <title>cmv: There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as an “American”</title>

    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>My only issue with this, is that the continent is also America.

Anyone who lives in any of the American continents are Americans. Including brazillians.</text>

    <text>There is no continent called "America" at least in the English speaking world. Theres North America, and South America, which can be collectively called "The America*s*", but there is no continent called America. 

Brazilians are South Americans. 


I understand that in Latin American countries they teach it as a singular continent, and that in combination with Spanish speakers using the word America different than English speakers has caused this confusion, but that sounds like a "them" problem to me. There is no confusion in English.</text>

    <text>North America and South America, and Central America all contain prefixes on the word America.

They are all American, but they might have sub classifications of American by using a prefix.

The United States of America, are a bunch of independent governments in the Americas which made an agreement to be united.

Later on, they replaced their articles of confederacy with a constitution making them a strongly united country.</text>
