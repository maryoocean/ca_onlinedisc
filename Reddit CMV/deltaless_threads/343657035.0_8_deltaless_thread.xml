    <title>CMV: U.S. Expenditures on defense is why there is so few terrorist attacks</title>

    <original_post>On Reddit the U.S. gets a lot of flak for spending so much on its defense budget. People often use the argument "[some uncommon event] kills more people a year than terrorists." I argue that this is because of our massive intelligence and military capabilities. Another hot button issue on Reddit seems to be the use of drones and many will argue that our drone program makes more enemies than it kills. Although I do recognize the flaws with our drone program I believe stopping is not a solution and the drone program weakens the capabilities of terrorists networks to effectively plan attacks. I subscribe to the "peace means carrying a big stick" philosophy. Change my view on American defense spending and drones.  </original_post>

    <text>I also believe in your core philosophy. 

However, the reason there are less terrorist attacks here is because there are less terrorists in America.

Why are there more in Europe? Because they don't have to cross an ocean to get to Europe. 

So, my point isn't that we shouldn't have a smaller military, just that our geographical location puts us much farther ahead than military strength.</text>
