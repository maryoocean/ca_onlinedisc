    <title>CMV: In the show "The Good Place", the presence of both Tahani and Chidi contradict the rules presented of who ends up there</title>

    <original_post>#Spoilers for The Good Place season 1. 

----

In The Good Place, Chidi is shown to have deserved to end up in the "Good" place because whilst he tried to live a good life and do what he thought was right, he was indecisive to the point where it caused harm to his friends and family.  

Tahani lived a life of charity and tried all that she could to help others, however it is revealed that this was overruled by the fact that she did so for selfish reasons. 

Chidi's judgement was based on the notion that how he affected those around him mattered more than his intentions. He never meant to hurt anyone and tried to do what he thought was right, but simply failed to do so in practice. 

Tahani's judgement was based in the notion that her intentions mattered more than what she did. 

The two of them are in direct contrast to each other. One did immense good but for the wrong reasons, and one did harm but unintentionally whilst trying to do what he thought was right.   
If Chidi belongs in the "Good" place then the impact of one's actions matter more than a person's intentions. If Tahani belongs in the "Good" place then the intentions of a person matter more than what they do. 

So CMV, Tahani and Chidi do not both belong in the "Good" place, only one of them does by the rules proposed in the show. 

Edit - people have already made points on the following topics and I will not award deltas for them: 

* The high bar proposed in the brief presentation on how the system works, requiring people to be close to perfect
* We don't know if we can trust anything in the presentation as it could have been a lie by Michael

    <text>In the orientation for "The Good Place" near the beginning of the show, it lists a ton of acts that are worth a certain number of points. It appears that having a positive score, or a sufficiently positive score, is necessary to make it to The Good Place, and otherwise you go elsewhere.

Based on that, we can conclude that The Good Place (appears to) operate based off of some sort of Utilitarian framework, albeit one where both intentions and outcomes matter. This means that it is possible that the harm caused by Chidi's failure to act and indecisiveness outweighed his good intentions, and that Tahani's selfishness outweighed her positive acts. 

On the flipside, we could also conclude that somebody who generally acts with good intentions but causes a minor amount of harm in addition to the good they cause could make it to The Good Place, and that somebody who acts for charity with only a minor selfish edge could as well. The Good Place does not appear to be binary.</text>
