    <original_post>I believe that working 40 hours a week is entirely unnecessary for even (and perhaps especially for) technologically advanced first-world countries to thrive.  I feel that it isn't even possible for the majority of people to stay engaged for 8 or 9 hours a day, and that the 80/20 principle applies beautifully here (80 percent of work gets done during 20 percent of the time).

Our technological productivity has outpace our wants and needs to such a vast degree that it seems there are only to reasons justifying such a long work-week:

1-The economic machine needs people to be occupied so that they fall into the consumer mentality and fill up their few remaining hours with purchased items to entertain and fulfill themselves.  If people worked less, even if they were as productive, our economic growth would slow (which ecologically needs to happen, but I suppose can be seen as a negative).

2-Certain endeavors demand 40 hours or more a week.  Athletics, science, writing...but these are passion-based, rather than need-based.

I believe we could live happily in a world where everyone worked 20 hours each week.  CMV

edit: An awesome article that sums up my points much better than I can (thanks /u/WishingForBadThings)

    <text>I have my own special perspective here.  There are some jobs that this just doesn't apply.  Take utility workers.  The level of automation required to safely and effectively run an electrical distribution system, water treatment plant, nuclear reactor, etc is not there yet.  Do you really want those places unmanned?  

Yes, you could hire more people, but there aren't enough people who want these jobs in the first place.  They are sometimes demanding.  They almost certainly require an above average intellect and problem solving capacity.  Some people just aren't cut out to do it.  

I could go on and on.  I'm just barely scratching the surface.

EDIT: Not bragging here, but I work a normal 40 hour week, but we are understaffed and people go on vacation.  I worked 48 hours in the last 72.  The water must flow!</text>
