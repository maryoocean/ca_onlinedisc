    <title>CMV:The Giving Tree is a story with horrible morals.</title>
    <original_poster>Sinreborn</original_poster>
    <original_post>I am currently having this discussion with my wife. Both of us had the book read to us as children and my wife now reads it to our 2 year old. I can't stand this book. I believe it to be the personification of entitlement. For those unfamiliar, a tree (most likely signifying parents) provides a boy with anything he needs until he takes everything the tree can give leaving only the stump. The boy is absent when he doesn't want things and openly complains about what the tree offers. There is no thanks given by the boy at anytime and no acknowledgement that he is damaging the tree beyond repair. 

I get the notions of self sacrifice that go into being a parent. I understand that I would probably do the same to make sure my own child lived a happy life. But I don't want to encourage this notion of desecration without though for stewardship or appreciation for the gifts being given.

Please change my mind so I can stop fighting with my wife.

    <text>If this is a children's book, then I can't make a judgment based on just the text.

You could easily illustrate this book in a way that serves your interpretation - glorifying being demanding to the point of destroying others.

Or, you could just as easily illustrate the exact same book in a way that highlights the deterioration of the tree as grander and grander demands are made of it, ending with a children's book's version of "He loved Big Brother."

So I did a search [and found the whole thing](http://www.slideshare.net/wicaksana/the-giving-tree-3293089). And it didn't help!

I now think that ambiguity of angle is the book's intent.

So I would assert that you and your wife are both not right, and that both your interpretations are meant by the author and illustrator (presumably the same person?) to be correct.</text>
