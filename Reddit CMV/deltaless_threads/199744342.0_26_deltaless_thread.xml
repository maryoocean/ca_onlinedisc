    <title>CMV: Giving other cultures sh*t about eating dog meat is hypocritical</title>
    <original_poster>simobk</original_poster>
    <original_post>Hi all,

So someone just posted a video on my FB feed about [the Yulin dog meat festival](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=yulin+dog+meat+festival). It is horrifying...

For the purpose of this CMV, let's forget about how it's done (the way they get the dogs, they treat them... etc.) and concentrate **only** on the dog meat eating part.

I love dogs, and yes, I find it horrifying that other cultures eat them. However, I also understand that for other cultures, it is horrifying to see us eat beef or pork.

In my opinion, the only situation where you are allowed to complain is if you are talking about eating animal meat in general. But if you enjoy eating a good steak, then it is hypocritical to criticize others for eating what they consider is "just meat".

Again, I am stressing the fact that this is not about the *animal cruelty* part. It's just about the meat eating. For the sake of this CMV, let's suppose that the animals are bred and slaughtered in the most humane possible way.

So... CMV

    <text>Leaving aside for the moment that "hypocrisy" means pretending to have a virtue that you don't have, which people complaining about this don't do...

Morality and ethics are an evolutionary trait that humans, and some other animals, have developed to live together in societies. 

Are you genuinely surprised that people from a culture who treats dogs like members of their family would be unhappy about people eating them? Such behavior is, to them, genuinely anti-social. 

No, it's not necessarily the case in another culture, but it's entirely unavoidable, and completely human nature. 

Actually, there really aren't any world cultures that I know of in which there aren't a significant number of people who also treat dogs as being pseudo-human. Certainly many of the Chinese do. Such behavior is very likely to generate conflict in their culture eventually. 

It is therefore, pretty much by definition, immoral.</text>
