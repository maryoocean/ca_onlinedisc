    <original_post>Every now and then, I see the odd post, "If the top 1% gave up their profits, we could cure world hunger" or something ridiculous like that. I dont know why people that have less expect people that have more to help them. Why should they? 

Edit: better example. 

Edit: my C got Ved, /u/amemut explained it in a very pragmatic manner that I could agree with. </original_post>

    <text>The poor have no obligation to let you to live without helping them.

If poor are the minority, you'll mostly get away with that. However, if poor are a considerable mass, they'll elect socialist leaders who will make sure that you help them by increasing taxes for you and they'll use the money to help the poor.

So, basically, you will end up maintaining a society where most people are rich (how will you do that without helping poor?) or end up paying very high taxes and hence helping the poor anyway.</text>

    <text>Most people can't be rich, by definition. Rich will always be a minority, because if everyone has that kind of money, then it's not worth anything.</text>

    <text>Most of the people can't be poor either. By *rich*, I mean *not poor*. My *rich* includes those who are not too poor to consider fighting the more richer ones too.</text>
