    <original_post>Homosexuality is not natural, and neither is heterosexuality

There is no such thing as attraction in other mammal species, just the male raping the female and reproducing. 

Attraction in humans is a social construct. It's a way to soothe people or to bond similar to how bonobos do it.

Because us humans have “the instinctive need to produce offspring,” the sheer fact that men want to have PiV sex with women just for fun or without wanting kids, proves it's not a natural attraction.

Plus, most women don't care about being penetrated. It doesn't feel good for us, clitoral stimulation is a need for most. PiV sex has no purpose outside of getting pregnant. Sexual relationships are not necessary at all.</original_post>

    <text>Can you explain why some animals masturbate then? Whales will use soft rocks to rub themselves until they climax. Dolphins will bite the head off fish and use it to masturbate... Both of these examples prove that sex isn't just for reproducing in nature. 

Can you explain why they've done studies and proven that sex and masturbation are healthy for humans not just for reproducing? 

Can you explain why they've noted heterosexual and homosexual relationships in nature if it's not natural?  Relationships, not just sex to reproduce but actual family dynamics as you yourself noted... 

Can you explain penguins and how they fall in love with one other to mate for life? 

If it isn't natural why does it occur in nature as well as humans?

ETA: I'm a woman and I really really enjoy PiV sex, so please understand what you like is what YOU like...</text>
