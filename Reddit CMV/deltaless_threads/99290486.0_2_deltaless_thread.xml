    <original_post>I feel that many people would be offended if a city had a sports team that was called the [insert city] Black People, or even The Blacks, with their logo being a black man's head. However, people (for the most part) accept the fact that the Washington Redskins have all of those same elements, except with a Native American.

 I know that in the past, and perhaps even currently, there has been a movement to get these Native American team names changed, but as we know, mostly nothing has come of this. I feel like if I made a team whose mascot was a black man, that team would receive such outrage that it would never survive. But if the Redskins can exist, the Black People should also be able to exist. CMV.</original_post>

    <text>There is no rule that says they can't have a team with such a name. Nobody has done it because that would be a stupid idea. Not for nothing but I believe that naming a team after a Native American tribe/person/whatever at least draws attention to their plight more so than is done in school curricula and is a good thing. I think it celebrates them. </text>
