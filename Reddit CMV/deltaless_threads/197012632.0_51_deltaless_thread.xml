    <title>CMV: Bernie Sanders idea of free college doesn't seem like a good thing.</title>
    <original_poster>mbeogoa</original_poster>
    <original_post>This is probably because I am really bad at understanding politics and don't totally know what Sanders wants to do.  

But the money for free college would come from taxes, correct?  Does that mean that taxes would get raised or that he would just alter around the spending the government does?  Because if taxes are going to get raised that means I have to pay for my own loans that are going to take 10 years plus extra taxes so people can go for free?  That is not fair and while it seems nice, I don't have the money for that.  Nor, I'm sure, do most Americans.  

And what happens with private institutions?  Does that mean through my taxes I am paying for someone to go a $60,000 school when I couldn't go to one myself because I couldn't afford it?  Maybe that seems selfish, but that does not seem fair.  And the government should not be able to force me to pay so other people can get an easier life when I myself did not get that chance.  By the way, I know I am already being forced to pay for things I don't want, but shouldn't we be trying to lessen those instances instead of adding to them?

I mean, on paper his idea sounds great.  Free college, a better educated America, a more economically even country. YAY.  But that doesn't come for free.  And just because I am finally out of school and making a semi-decent wage doesn't mean I should have to pay for other people.  I guess that means I am anti-socialism?  Is there maybe any other way that this could be accomplished?  Like just lessening the cost of college somehow instead of totally free?

    <text>I think the biggest problem with providing college for all isn't even how you pay for it (which is a big problem but I think others have debated that on either side quite a bit here already).

The biggest problem is that inflates education. We already live in a society where you need a bachelor's degree where you used to need a high school diploma, and you need a master's degree where you used to need a bachelor's degree. That's scary.

"Adolescence" didn't exist before the Industrial Revolution. The Progressive Movement, which included a push for universal, compulsory public education, played a large role in creating it, to the detriment of humanity. Delaying the onset of adulthood creates all kinds of psychological and sociological problems. It's where high teenage suicide rates come from. It's where juvenile delinquency comes from.

I think society is better off for having a more educated populace. But I also think that, while free education is nice, compulsory education is morally equivalent to slavery, if on a different scale. And insofar as we give people more education than they actually need for the jobs their innate talent qualifies them for, we create a market where people have to acquire more education than is optimal for them just to be competitive. In universities, grade inflation is rampant and increasingly seen as a huge problem.</text>
