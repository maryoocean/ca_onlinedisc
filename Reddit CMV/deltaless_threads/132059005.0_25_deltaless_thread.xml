    <title>CMV: I think masturbation is bad for you.</title>
    <original_poster>TextingWhileDriving</original_poster>
    <original_post>I used to be part of the /r/NoFap community and felt good about it. I had a sense of pride when a day passed without masturbation squeezed in there. However, I never went longer than 2 weeks without masturbating. Each time I masturbated I felt a sense of dread and depression, knowing I would just masturbate again sometime later. 

Today I broke my 4 day streak. I feel depressed and stressed. This basically confirms how I felt about masturbation in the beginning. It's bad for you. You could change my view with study's or from experience yourself. Go ahead and try changing my view. </original_post>

    <text>I think what you are doing is substituting the hormonal low you get after masturbation for negative impacts. There isnt too much information yet about it but after digging in [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory_period_%28sex%29) Wikipedia article I found [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-coital_tristesse)</text>
