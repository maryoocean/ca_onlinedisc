    <title>CMV: Democracy can be saved if the left learns to LIE better than the right</title>
    <original_poster>Preaddly</original_poster>
    <original_post>There are numerous challenges for which effective solutions are yet to be found. Individuals who hold the belief that a world without solutions is not acceptable may find themselves disillusioned by the lack of offerings of the left. Similarly, the right does not provide viable solutions, although it is inclined to fabricate false remedies that instill hope. While the left may easily disprove these proposed solutions, it often fails to provide alternative avenues, resulting in a sense of despair. 

For example, there is presently no established legal framework to enable individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds to accumulate sufficient wealth to secure financial independence. The right suggests curbing immigration to create job opportunities for Americans, but this solution is not feasible. However, the only alternative is enduring an arduous existence of living paycheck to paycheck for a staggering sixty-two years. 

Choosing not to address this issue isn't doing the left any favors. It's now to the point where right-wing charlatans are now waging war on democracy itself. They never would've been able to gain as much power as they have if not for the willingness to lie. 

Although the left may lack immediate solutions, there exists a cohort of opportunists ready to exploit this vulnerability. In order to inspire hope, the left must also be willing to present alternate narratives, even if they deviate from the truth. A demoralized population will be more prone to believing unfounded claims made by just about anyone, including the idea that democracy is ineffectual.</original_post>

    <text>I remember someone saying "I wish I never called it the Inflation Reduction Act, as it has little to do with inflation" but before it passed everyone and everyone on Reddit was like "oh my God, look at this link and here's proof that this bill will reduce inflation. And after Biden admitted it wasn't about inflation, no one steps back and says what?  Both parties are lieng to you.    What we really need is for people to understand that you actually have to talk to the other side to make progress. Remember that guy that convinced a bunch of KKK guys to leave the KKK? He didn't do so by just yelling at them and shooting down any chance of discussion. I know I know Republicans today are just so much worse than Republicans of the 50s.   What about the border? AOC no crisis. Crime AOC those stats are wrong, crime isn't up. Those are lies.   If you want me to rant against Republicans I can do that too.</text>
