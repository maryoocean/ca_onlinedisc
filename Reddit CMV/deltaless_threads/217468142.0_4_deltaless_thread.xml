    <title>CMV: StubHub and other ticket resale sites should be illegal and considered scalping.</title>
    <original_poster>aikdaman</original_poster>
    <original_post>In the US, 38 states have laws allowing the reselling of event tickets as long as the sale does not take place at the event site. The other 12 states have varying degrees of regulation, including registration requirements and maximum markups.

Why do we allow this middle man corporation to exist as a loophole for scalping and legally marking tickets up to exorbitant amounts.

At the very least there should be rules and restrictions in place for maximum markups. I understand supply and demand but find it ridiculous that often the re-seller makes the most money per ticket involved in a sold out production for doing essentially nothing. Oh the American way...

    <text>Secondary markets usually reduce the price of a good. Would airplane tickets, if they could be resold/transferred, cost more or less?

There are some cases where event tickets cost more, but it's because the market is willing to pay more. 

I should be able to resell whatever I buy without government interference because freedom.</text>

    <text>So you believe you should be able to resell airplane tickets because you bought them?
