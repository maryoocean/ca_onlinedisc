    <title>CMV: Picky eaters deserve more respect and shouldn’t be shamed for being picky</title>
    <original_poster>UsualMorning98</original_poster>
    <original_post>It’s not always the picky eater’s fault they’re picky. It could be due to how they were raised (not their fault), trauma or sensory issues with food (something that can be really hard to work through) and many other factors.

A lot of them either try their best to make things easier for “regular” eaters (bringing their own food to events, looking at the menu beforehand, ordering from the kid’s menu, simply not eating that meal/day etc) or feel extreme guilt when they can’t accommodate to those who will shame them.

I’m not saying they should be prioritised over people with allergies or those with other food needs (like vegetarians or those who don’t eat certain foods for religious reasons). But they deserve a little more respect and support because it’s also hard for them being picky eaters. Definitely prioritise food issues that could harm someone. But once that’s sorted, don’t get mad at the picky eaters for just trying to exist.</original_post>

    <text>What determines if someone is a picky eater? Like what level of picky? My wife will eat basically anything. My daughter-in-law won’t eat any Mexican food, any Indian, anything spicy, or anything that she doesn’t know what it is. I’m somewhere in the middle. I love trying new foods, but there are some things I won’t eat, seafood being the biggest one.

To me my DIL is very picky but I don’t think I’m picky. My wife thinks I’m a picky eater because I don’t eat seafood.</text>
