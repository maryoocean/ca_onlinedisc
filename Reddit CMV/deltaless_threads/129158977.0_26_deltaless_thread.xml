    <title>CMV: I believe that abortion as a result of consensual sex (without contraception) is wrong.</title>
    <original_poster>BreakinMyBallz</original_poster>
    <original_post>I feel as though women who choose to have sex without the means of contraception, simply don't care if they get pregnant. They put their pleasures over the risk of having a child and having it terminated. 

I feel as though, when the sperm and egg mix, they create a completely new set of DNA, DNA that has never been the same in the entire history of our species and is a completely unique person (I'm not Theist, I try to base my arguments on the uniqueness of each person)

I don't see any way for someone to justify abortion when it is the result of sex without contraception. That woman simply did not care that new life was created within her, and chose to have sex in the first place. We argue it's a woman's choice for abortion? No, It's a woman's choice to have sex without the means of contraception.

-------
Clarification - I believe contraception is OK because new life with unique DNA and a unique person has not been formed and therefore will not be removed from the world.</original_post>

    <text>&amp;gt; I feel as though women who choose to have sex without the means of contraception, simply don't care if they get pregnant. They put their pleasures over the risk of having a child and having it terminated. 

Unfortunately, not everyone in the world has access to contraception. According to the International Planned Parenthood Foundation (http://www.ippf.org/our-work/what-we-do/contraception/access) "In sub-Saharan Africa 20% of women in relationships lack access to contraception. In the Caribbean it is 25%. In South-Eastern Asia and Northern Africa, 10% of women have unmet family planning needs." 

Many women, even in the U.S. and other relatively affluent countries, may have access only to condoms, a method which is solely reliant on men. That makes it difficult to blame women for putting "their pleasures over the risk of having a child and having it terminated." Many women who would consider the sex they have to be consensual may still face significant pressure from their partners to not use condoms, which are more associated with reduction in male pleasure than reduction in female pleasure.

There's also a wide range of contraception methods, and couples must always weigh the costs and benefits of particular methods, considering risks and reduction in pleasure against efficacy. At one end of the spectrum is using only the "rhythm" method of timing sex during non-fertile periods, at the other would be combining a copper IUD and oral hormones. How far, in your view, must a woman go in her attempt to avoid pregnancy to make abortion okay?</text>
