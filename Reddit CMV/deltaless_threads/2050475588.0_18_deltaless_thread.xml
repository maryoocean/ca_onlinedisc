    <title>CMV: The only difference between AI (digital) life and human (physical) life is the material which sustains it</title>
    <original_poster>CarpeBedlam</original_poster>
    <original_post>To be clear, I’m talking about a theoretical AI which is designed specifically to be indistinguishable from a human, and accomplishes that goal. Also, I don’t necessarily mean an android that is physically equivalent (e.g. Ash from “Alien”), but just a digital consciousness living in a computer which is capable of replicating human behavior. At that point, I’m struggling to find a difference between the two that isn’t solely about the material required to sustain the life (blood, tissue, etc. for human life, silicon, copper, etc. for AI life).</original_post>

    <text>I know this post is already a day old but I just wanted to add that theories like [Universal Grammar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_grammar) suggest that there is a far broader biological basis to the way we learn and process information than could ever be identically replicated in artificial intelligence. There are certain intrinsic ideas that human beings genetically and biologically possess that could not be replicated by a neural network starting from scratch.</text>
