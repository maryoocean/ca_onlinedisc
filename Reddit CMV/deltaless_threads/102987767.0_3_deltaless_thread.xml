    <title>Christianity is fine, but the modern world would be a be a better place without Islam. CMV</title>

    <original_post>I'll preface the statement by saying that from a completely ideological perspective, I understand that Islam is experiencing the same thing Christianity experienced in the Middle Ages. Additionally, I do not think that Islam is an inherently bad institution, I jus believe that it's a driving force for far too many problems. Every week, we here about honor killings and suicide bombings. With the recent mall takeover in Kenya, I simply can no longer believe that Islam is a positive institution. I would like to believe that Islam can be a positive institution, but ultimately it's a net negative on society and the world would be a happier, safer place without it.</original_post>

that is not of islamic teachings. those are radicals who think that killing others will bring them closer to their god. this is comparable to the mass killings of non christians from 200 AD to today to either convert people or have them executed for the righteousness of god.  every religion has had their radicals who think killing others who dont believe the same will make them be a better person.

that being said, people are free to believe what they believe and shouldn't be discredited for the radicals that take such actions.</text>
