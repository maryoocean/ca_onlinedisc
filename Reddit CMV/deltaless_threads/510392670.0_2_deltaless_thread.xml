    <title>CMV: OCD doesn't have to be debilitating</title>
    <original_poster>lookslikeamirac</original_poster>
    <original_post>A lot of people get ticked off a bit when someone says something like "I'm OCD about _____" because they don't think it's legitimate and they see it as undermining what people with 'real' OCD go through.

I understand that maybe it seems insignificant to someone who has to wash his or her hands 20 times before bed, but it doesn't mean it's not some degree of OCD.

A hypothetical situation:

There's a guy who always leaves the volume on an even number when he changes it. When he turns on the TV though, he doesn't check to make sure it's an even number. So if it's already odd when he turns it on, then it's fine.

He changes the volume and sets it to an even number. Then, his friend changes it to odd and steals the remote. It doesn't prevent the man from watching TV, but it makes him slightly uncomfortable because he knows it's odd and he asks for the other guy to change the volume to an even number. The man refuses, and both men go on watching TV leaving the first man a little uneasy. After a while, the friend goes to the bathroom and forgets about the remote/volume, and the first guy steals the remote back to change it back to even.

My claim is that the guy may still have OCD since it makes him feel uncomfortable. It doesn't mean he *has to* change the volume back but he'd greatly prefer it be on an even number and gives some small anxiety when he knows that's not the case. It's enough that the friend forgot about it, but he remembered and immediately changed it on the first opportunity. 

To change my mind please provide evidence that my situation or a similar one *can't* be OCD. There may be no way around a semantic argument since we're dealing with medical terms, but try to avoid it if possible.

    <text>By definition in the DSM-V something has to impair your life in order to be a mental illness. So to have OCD your impulses have to at least be somewhat debilitating. Just being uncomfortable is not sufficient to qualify as having OCD. </text>

    <text>If a man is hit with anxiety for an hour and a half before his friend gets up to go to the bathroom, isn't that somewhat debilitating?</text>

    <text>You're right I didn't make it 100% clear. In my brain discomfort was equivalent to anxiety but there's absolutely no way for you to have known that haha.</text>
