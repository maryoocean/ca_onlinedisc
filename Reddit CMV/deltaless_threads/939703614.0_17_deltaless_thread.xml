    <title>CMV: Where your born doesn't matter and country pride is pointless</title>
    <original_poster>Blank-VII</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't think I belong to a country and I think the concept is odd. I was born in the UK and have lived here all my life, but I fail to understand why people are so hard-core about being a 'proud brit' or anything. Where I was born isn't something I was able to decide for myself, and I want my life to be what I make out of it, not what it decides for me. I believe the only way to belong to a country is to find one whose culture is similar to your own tastes and opinions, and to move there. What's the point in being proud of a country I was born in if I feel no attachment to how it's run or anything else?

*you're

*View partially changed. Country pride is not pointless.

**Main view unchanged, it seems no-one can quite convince me. I've had some fantastic conversations and I'm really happy with how many of you engaged without being toxic. Stay safe y'all. Thanks so much!**</original_post>

    <text>The way I see it, your birthplace and the culture of your birth country, in no way define who you become. They are simply your starting point. You, along with your fellow countrymen, can have a sense of "we're in this together" and "how do we make this a better place for those who come after us".

This is the same for the town you were born in, and at some point in the future perhaps us Earthlings will also join together and collectively work to make this place we began something better.

Family and cultural traditions help give us a past; give us roots. They can help us strengthen us against the storms, but in the end it is up to us to grow strong and tall and provide something to those who look to us for what we can offer in return. 

If you are feeling a disconnect with your home country, I suggest you do some genealogical research to find where your family came from. Perhaps you will find an ancestor who at some point felt the same as you and decided to travel to a faraway land and call it home. It may help you connect.</text>
