    <title>CMV: Legislative bodies should be required to explain, in formal writing, why they voted a certain way when it comes to legislation.</title>

    <original_post>I think publicly elected officials responsible for driving policy and legislation should be required to explain why they vote certain ways in writing. Voting along party lines is reprehensible regardless of the side. Politics shouldn't be a game about which side wins, but rather which fact-based opinions win regardless of sides. If the legislative bodies have no reasonable explanation for why they voted a certain way besides voting along party lines, they should not be allowed to vote because we have no reason to believe that they're not voting out of self-interest. If, for example, someone in Congress voted against what seems to be reasonable gun law without explanation, but you can see in their financial disclosure that the NRA contributes a lot of money and support for them, how are we to know that their vote was not influenced by the NRA without them explicitly citing so and explaining what other reason compelled them not to vote for said reasonable legislation? I'm not even asking for a long written response from them. A short paragraph or page summary with sources they're using to base their vote on is good enough. </original_post>

    <text>It wouldn’t change much as each voting bloc already has a reason pre-written with appropriate marketing, explanation, and reasoning.  Everyone is united and quotes from the same page.

What you really want won’t be written down.  

- I need to vote with my party otherwise they will drive me out next cycle.  
- My corporate sponsors wrote the legislation for me to present and I need to stay on message.  
- If I don’t take this post-congressional position for $200k with stock options and insider trading, someone else will.
- if I don’t take this PAC money and line my pockets, they will give it to my competitor and crush me next cycle.
- because I’m voting the right way for this issue I don’t care about, my party promises to back me on my pet project that I do care about.  Quid pro quo with my party.</text>
