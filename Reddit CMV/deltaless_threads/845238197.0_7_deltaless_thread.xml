    <title>CMV: The MLB should simply allow pitchers to communicate with their catchers via technology.</title>

    <original_post>I understand the history of the game and how important tradition is, but this imo is one of those situations where the sport simply needs to evolve with the times.

In the NFL, coaches can communicate with their quarterbacks via radios in the helmet. Is anyone complaining? We've already got instant replay in all major sports, is this not breaking from tradition? It's not exactly difficult to fixate a telescope lens on a catcher (home base does not move). This can be done from a high rise across the street from center field. With a little effort, the center field vantage point is undetectable in most ballparks.

As for tradition, what's worse? 3 years of .... "I wonder what could have been"... or allowing pitchers and catchers a more surefire option to communicate with one another.</original_post>

    <text>Batters can hear the catcher talking. Thatâ€™s why silent communication is valuable.</text>

    <text>OPs already clarified that "communication" would be in the form of pulses or the like from catcher to pitcher, not verbal.</text>

    <text>So how is that better than the current system?</text>

    <text>The pulses wouldn't really be "stealable" because they aren't visually or audibly noticed by anyone except the pitcher &amp;amp; catcher.</text>
