    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>Individuals and institutions are different. There are prescriptive and descriptive labels, white, black, and Asian all are descriptive. Whereas someone being a cop is an intentional choice and an action and if there is a huge disservice to the public being performed by police, then begs the question, where are all the good cops then? It is similar question that gets thrown around all the time for democrats, republicans, muslims, christians, if you join a club, and there are large number of people in that club beating up innocents, you either kick them out of the club or you leave.</text>
