    <title>CMV: Fredom of speech is far more important than a few people being offended</title>
    <original_poster>brbrWh0r3</original_poster>
    <original_post>Freedom of speech should be protected and kept, there shouldn't be people arrested for anti trans comments or insulting a soldier/soldiers, or for nazi jokes, or racist remarks or jokes.

Those should all be handled between people, if someone says stuff you dont like you handle it, simply block them or avoid them, theres a whole world you can be in and that persons in a very tiny part of it. 

It makes me nervous seeing people arrested and charged for saying things. It's only leading us to a place where we can be arrested for saying whatever the government doesnt like. And they shouldn't be in that much power to effect our communication with eachother. 

I live in scotland and dont feel I have freedom of speech anymore. 

(For the record I'm a white woman who's bi and have trans thoughts ig for those folks who say it never has been about me, it has sometimes, and in more ways than just those)

Edit: No it's not just anti trans people, Yes I believe crimes other than hate crimes involving speech should be illegal (threatening violence, doxing, defamation) but I also believe insults, jokes and bad takes or thoughts should not be.

Edit 2: Consequences for what is said like losing a job, getting insulted, losing friends ect is totally fine I just dont think the Government should be in charge of what can get you arrested in this sence.

Edit 3: I live in SCOTLAND in the UNITED KINGDOM or in BRITAIN depending what you say, I'm not american, im also not here advocating for my right to be a dick, im just saying the government arent the ones I want saying what I cant say, I mean twitter can destroy lives without them anyway.</original_post>

    <text>I hope you‚Äôre aware that the original ‚Äúfreedom of speech ‚â† freedom from consequences‚Äù line is a paraphrase of a quote from Idi Amin, one of the most brutal dictators in human history. I‚Äôm sorry, I see this point everywhere and it seems not enough people know it comes from a guy who killed between 80,000 and 300,000 people.</text>

    <text>Where im from freedom of speech means ones right to act like fox news on meth. And its has consequences when it goes unchecked. One of those consequences that has arisen is a decent uptick of violence against the LGBTQ2S+ community, increased violence toward progressive ideas, and increased violence against Muslim women esp. Consequences dont necessarily mean youre going to jail for what you say, its greater than that. (Alsp obvs googling this mans)</text>
