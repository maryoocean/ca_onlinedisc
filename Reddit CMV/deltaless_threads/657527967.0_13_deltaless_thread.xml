    <title>CMV: Modern marriage in the US brings more harm than benefit for men.</title>
    <original_poster>cannibalstreudel</original_poster>
    <original_post>I believe based on marriage laws and divorce practices that marriage no longer has more benefits than harm for men.

For women it's the opposite. I believe this because whether laws state this or not, practices in divorce court often grant kids' custody to the mother from the father when they aren't more dangerous to their kids than their wife. And often men have to give up half their income/assets in divorce when they often make most of the income of the household.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Sure there are emotional benefits to a long term relationship. But there aren't extra benefits for men on top of an emotionally committed relationship that exclusively comes with marriate.

The security marriage itself brings is only for the woman. She gets to enjoy financial guarantee of sharing income when men often make more than women, and she can be assured of his fidelity - it's backed up by government enforcement... women rarely are punished for fucking another guy and being impregnated at the level men are, and often the man in the marriage gets cucked and is made responsible for raising another man's child.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Men are bringing unnecessary vulnerabilities on themselves when they marry a woman in modern US courts.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

If someone can reliably demonstrate that marriage gives more potential benefit to men than potential harm, I would believe marriage brings more benefit than harm to men. And to be clear, I'm not talking about long term relationships, I'm talking about specifically signing a marriage document and putting the law behind the union.</original_post>

    <text>&amp;gt; practices in divorce court often grant kids' custody to the mother from the father when they aren't more dangerous to their kids than their wife. 

It is fairly uncommon that child custody is even contested, making up only [8 to 13% of custody cases](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b8c4/89d04fa2e9de06c77e3dc40209499debc146.pdf).  The other cases both parents agree to the custody arrangement.

&amp;gt; Contested custody case estimates range from eight to thirteen percent of all
divorces involving children. In the remaining 87 to 92% of the cases, the mother is
overwhelmingly agreed between the parties to be the parent with physical custody.

And when couples agree, they overwhelming agree that the mother is the one that should get custody.  Is it that odd that in the uncommon situations where it IS contested, that the courts come to similar conclusions as many couples come to on their own?

&amp;gt; And often men have to give up half their income/assets in divorce when they often make most of the income of the household.

It often makes sense for one parent to be stay at home and often both people in the relationship agree for the wife to truncate their career and become a full time parent.  If this is really that much of a concern to you, go find a women that makes more money than you.

Or if the handling of kids is a problem for you... don't have kids.  Sounds like you don't want kids anyway and there are plenty of women that don't want kids either, and then you wouldn't have to worry about child support payments either.</text>

    <text>I am not decided on kids. I know I'd find it very fulfilling to be a father but I'm not sure if it's a responsibility I'm willing to take. I don't see how you're refuting any of my points though... It's a financial risk for men. I'm not saying there's no reason for it I'm saying marriage comes with deep risks for men which outweigh the benefits.</text>

    <text>Those are risks inbedded in having kids, not marriage, and women are taking the bigger risk by giving up their jobs, which self destructs their career and means they'll have take a few steps back if they decide to start working again.

Kids are absolutely a financial risk that BOTH people in the relationship are full members of that risk.

Women are absolutely taking just as much of a risk, if not more, especially if you start dating someone at a similar professional level as yourself.</text>

    <text>Women do take risk for sure. I'm not downplaying this in any way. I'm saying that there's no benefit for men in marriage. I've heard it's a way to mediate risk so the men's risk equals the women's risk and this is a compelling argument... It almost proves my point that there's no benefit for men. It means men are willingly putting themselves on the line for their women... sticking their necks out if you will to equal the woman's vulnerability with her body and being abandoned and stuck with the child.</text>

    <text>So if you're saying that's the purpose of marriage - to mediate the risk women take biologically, then sure. I can understand that point of view, and as long as laws and courts in practice are fair with custody rulings, financial rulings etc. in divorce then I can see the benefit of marriage to a relationship when a couple plans for kids.</text>

    <text>That's a very specific situation - having kids, and still requires a few things to be proven to me specifically the laws and their implementation being reasonable. If they're reasonably applied, then I can see the utility of marriage in making a woman more comfortable allowing herself to be vulnerable biologically and to form a stable family unit for the whole, but if they're skewed towards favoring women then it's a net detriment for the man. I'd also need to see that women are punished for infidelity just as a man is.</text>

90% of custody arrangements are decided through mutual agreement.  What more do you need?  The vast majority of people just get the custody arrangement they decided on.

&amp;gt; I'd also need to see that women are punished for infidelity just as a man is.

The courts don't punish infidelity.  The only time that is even relevant is when there is a prenuptial agreement which has a fidelity clause.  Otherwise it doesn't matter at all why you're getting a divorce, who did what, or who instigated the divorce proceedings.

Each person is still entitled to 50% of the marital assets, 0% of the other person's pre-marital assets, and 100% of their own pre-marital assets (unless you have a prenup that states elsewise).

[95%](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-divorce-process/) of divorces don't go to trial.  That means you  (and your lawyer) and them (and their lawyer) just work together to figure out how to divide up your assets. It's really hard to accuse the courts being unfair when they're only even involved in 5% of divorces.</text>

    <text>Exactly. If the man divorces the woman for cheating on him, he still has to pay her half of his shit if there's no prenup. I've seen statistics showing that when controlled for other variables like financial standing, men are given much less respect in divorce court than women. I'd need this disproven to believe divorce is financially fair to both parties and based on merit rather than a responsibility put on men's shoulders primarily.

And while 1/20 of divorces go to trial, I'm talking about potential harm here. My claim as I stated above is that marriage brings much more potential harm to men than potential benefit if she changes in the marriage, which happens quite often. I've heard time and time again "she was so supportive until..." and then she takes everything from him. Marriage leaves men open to this in ways it doesn't make up for with any benefit.

Also 1/20 is a large risk to take.</text>
