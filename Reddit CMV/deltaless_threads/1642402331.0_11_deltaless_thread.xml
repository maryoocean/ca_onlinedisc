    <title>CMV: The onus of sustainability is excessively placed on consumers and the obligation should instead be placed on corporations.</title>
    <original_poster>Fluffy_Owl4316</original_poster>
    <original_post>Much of the media we read today about sustainability is focused on what consumers should be doing to move the needle. This includes things such as recycling food containers, composting food scraps, repairing and reusing clothing rather than purchasing new, etc. As corporations continue to produce these items, the proper disposal and thus environmental impact, is placed on the consumer. 

On the other hand, corporations are publishing lofty goals about recycled materials and reduced carbon footprint by 2050 or other far-off timeframes. Yet, there is little regulation to ensure that these goals are achieved. There isn’t a single governing body which is responsible for measuring the attainment of these statements, which doesn’t hinder the goodwill of creating the goals, but does little to hold corporations accountable for achieving them. 

At the end of the day, large corporations are responsible for much of the waste which harms the environment and should have a greater obligation and more enforcement of sustainable methods and materials. While end users are also responsible, humans fall victim to common errors and shortcomings which make true environmental impact, one that moves the needle, nearly impossible for individual users, even collectively as compared to large businesses. While the responsibility for sustainability and carbon footprint is often targeted towards consumers, the narrative should instead be on large corporations and how to hold them accountable to finding sustainable solutions.</original_post>

    <text>Corporations are merely conglomerations of people. Corporations are made up of people making the decisions. You need individuals to make the changes and the decisions to make the changes.

More companies have gone broke because of not responding to consumers (the market) and bad decisions than by regulations which should imply that its way better and effective to change corporate behavior by customer behavior.

At the same time when people say that corporations have all the propaganda and media tools at their disposal they often fail to recognise others also have this tools to use against competitors who are not sustainable. ie; it becomes an incentive for companies to differentiate if thats what customers want.

Yes, regulations have their place but 1 individual can do more harm than a lot of sustainable regulated corporations. We need to change behaviors not just regulate bad behavior.</text>
