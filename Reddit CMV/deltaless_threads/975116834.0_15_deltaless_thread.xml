    <title>CMV: Racism towards white people exists</title>
    <original_poster>OnlyNineteenLetters</original_poster>
    <original_post>Racism by definition is prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.

People throw around that racism is based off power+prejudice but that is incorrect according to the definition. They seem to think that because white people are 'dominant' in society that you can't be racist to them because of their position, but that is not true. People who say reverse racism does not exist are right, because it is normal racism. Racism is based purely off that: Race. Not power or position in society. 

The power+prejudice argument was invented so that certain parties could espouse racist views without the negative stigma of the term.</original_post>

    <text>To anyone in this subreddit thinking that you cannot be racist to white people. Come to South Africa. You can get a tour to all the farms where the white owners were tortured and killed because of the color of their skin.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

There was an incident in South Africa where they put a white child in boiling water to torture him, they raped and tortured his mother to death. They tortured and killed the father. if you think this is not true, look at Lauren Souther's farmlands video on youtube. She did a documentary, the government here tried to suppress it and wanted to kick her out of the country when they found out that she is exposing farm murders based on skin color</text>
