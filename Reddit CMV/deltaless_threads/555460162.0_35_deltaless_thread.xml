    <title>CMV: Most people are not well read enough to reasonably advocate for political or economic change</title>
    <original_poster>I_am_Norwegian</original_poster>
    <original_post>**Edit: "Well read" was a poor choice of words. I think "have done their due diligence" might be more accurate.**

I'm writing this because I want to be proven wrong, because people saying political things, especially as if obvious has started to annoy and anger me more. Especially if they're making fun of someone for their political views, even if I disagree with those views. I hate feeling angry, so hopefully writing my thoughts out will help.

In trying to figure out my own political views, I've come to realize that I can't reasonably hold the views I held, or any other views. I studied economics, mainly the school of thought that appealed to me. But then more and more I came to realize that I couldn't say if the Keynesian or post-keynesian or the Chicago school or MMT etc. were correct, and that even people who devote their lives to the study of economics struggle with the same thing. The same thing happened in philosophy, especially as I came to realize the importance of epistemology and ontology.

And you can't reasonably expect people to put in the effort and time that it takes to sort through these fields. And that there is still such debate among the experts that even if you become and expert, the truth will not be obvious. I've come to understand what Socrates meant when he said something like "I only know that I know nothing".

I've also come to believe that people hold the beliefs they do more for social reasons. Less for the truth of the beliefs, but more because their reaffirm their identity, and their social bonds.

I can't blame them for that, or for not spending thousands of hours sorting through political thought, philosophy and economics. But a part of me still believes that they haven't done their due diligence, and I get angry that they can affirm themselves and their beliefs, while I sit here uncertain, unable to succinctly articulate why, or how to get this across properly.</original_post>

    <text>People who advocate for political or economic change are doing so because they are a participant in the political system, and the policy/laws will effect them. Just because someone is not “well read” does not mean they may not hold fundamental beliefs, and that policy could enforce/negate these beliefs. 

Also, I think it’s important to remember that advocation does not mean policy change. From the stance of the policy makers, in an ideal system, wouldn’t it be valuable to them to hear the voices of all those they represent, including the educated and the uneducated? Take minimum wage employees advocating for 15/hr... little of these people are “well read” on economics or politics, but their advocation is important because it highlights a problem in the current system for those who are “well read” who might actually be willing to fix it. 

It’s important to remember that there is no correct or incorrect system of politics or economics... every democratic government in the world is pretty much built on the principle of trying different ideas and seeing what sticks. </text>
