    <title>CMV: the US General election is a fantasy, there is no "better" candidate.</title>
    <original_poster>NotAnthonysThrowAway</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm not heavily involved in politics, I'm a lurker at best. So I won't pretend I know a tremendous amount about policy, economics, foreign affairs or any of that stuff. But what I see is a popularity contest between two people who are effectively identical in their arrogance, egocentrism, stupidity, and ability to sway masses of idiots. For the purpose of this argument, we'll say the race is between Donald Trump and Joe Biden and that's it. If Trump wins we will probably be stuck in some weird dystopian authoritarian oligarchy where the entire paradigm of federal government will become something completely alien and astronomically oppressive on America, its people, culture, policy, freedoms, etc. On the other hand, if Biden wins, we will have another Obama presidency where the vocal minority on the liberal end will scream in celebration of "all the great things democrats are getting done" when really its just more of the corporate elite and the political elite robbing working class people, starting illegal wars, caging children because they're immigrants and ignoring the needs of the american people. Honestly, The only reason I can possibly imagine somebody looking at this race and thinking one side is better or that America will be better off with one or the other as the POTUS, is because they aren't looking at the full picture. This isnt about Democrats vs Republicans, or Progressives vs Conservatives, or Leftists vs Neo-Liberals. It is about the same thing it has always been about since Bush. Its about the rich finding more ways to screw the poor. The only way we as a nation are going to shed our divisiveness and stand on the grounds of logic, critical thinking, and problem solving, is if we stand together and overthrow the current paradigm of administration and create a new party by force. There is no such thing as doing it legally, or going through official channels, or negotiating with legislators/public officials. If you give them an inch, they take a mile. Change my view.</original_post>

    <text>I think we need to level set here a little bit.  I'm 34 years old, and i can clearly remember my life under 3 presidents.  Trump, Obama, and Bush.  I was a child when Clinton was in office.

how much did my life change when bush was elected?  Not at all.  How much did my life change when obama was elected?  Not at all.  How much did my life change when Trump was elected?  you guess it, not at all.  4 more years of trump will be just like the last 4 years of trump.  It'll be business as usual in a country where the private sector has way more influence on peoples lives anyway.

I say all that because...

&amp;gt;If Trump wins we will probably be stuck in some weird dystopian authoritarian oligarchy where the entire paradigm of federal government will become something completely alien and astronomically oppressive on America, its people, culture, policy, freedoms, etc.

no.  I trump wins.  December 2020 will be just like December of 2016.  or at least the differences in your life won't be related to polictics.  Maybe UHC will be delayed by another 4 years.   That's bad but its not astronomically oppressive or alien.  Its business as usual.

Both candidates are more or less business as usual.  Things are pretty okay in america.  Our houses have electricity.  They have heat and AC.  They have running water.  we have access to low cost food.  are kids have pretty good schools. If you work your butt off and are clever you can earn a good income. Americans don't want radical change because radical change means risk.

While neither candidate is proposing radical changes, they're are big differences.  One is going to open up more immigration and treat illegal immigrants more humanly.  One wants campaign finance reform.  One wants to expand obama care and the other wants to tear it down.  This things wont' affect my life, but they'll affect some people.</text>
