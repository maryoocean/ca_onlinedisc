    <title>CMV: Democracy can be saved if the left learns to LIE better than the right</title>
    <original_poster>Preaddly</original_poster>
    <original_post>There are numerous challenges for which effective solutions are yet to be found. Individuals who hold the belief that a world without solutions is not acceptable may find themselves disillusioned by the lack of offerings of the left. Similarly, the right does not provide viable solutions, although it is inclined to fabricate false remedies that instill hope. While the left may easily disprove these proposed solutions, it often fails to provide alternative avenues, resulting in a sense of despair. 

For example, there is presently no established legal framework to enable individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds to accumulate sufficient wealth to secure financial independence. The right suggests curbing immigration to create job opportunities for Americans, but this solution is not feasible. However, the only alternative is enduring an arduous existence of living paycheck to paycheck for a staggering sixty-two years. 

Choosing not to address this issue isn't doing the left any favors. It's now to the point where right-wing charlatans are now waging war on democracy itself. They never would've been able to gain as much power as they have if not for the willingness to lie. 

Although the left may lack immediate solutions, there exists a cohort of opportunists ready to exploit this vulnerability. In order to inspire hope, the left must also be willing to present alternate narratives, even if they deviate from the truth. A demoralized population will be more prone to believing unfounded claims made by just about anyone, including the idea that democracy is ineffectual.</original_post>

    <text>What democracy is there to save? When was the US ever a democracy?

But to address your full post. America makes the most billionaires and millionaires. 
People from almost a lot of poor countries come here and do better than the average American.

People from almost all African and Asian backgrounds are higher earners on average than white Americans. 

Is America the *best* at financial mobility? No. But it is better than most places.</text>

I agree. But the people it's not going to work for aren't just going to go away. They're going to get desperate. They're going to be susceptible to anyone or anything that will inspire hope.</text>

    <text>That’s with any place though. Name a place that doesn’t have its poor and needy. 

Name a place that doesn’t have that an let’s in millions of people a year. 

You’re wishing for the moon honestly. 


On top of that, most issues that plague the US need to be handled on the local level, not the federal level. A complete overhaul on education could make a huge change.</text>
