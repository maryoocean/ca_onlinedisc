    <title>CMV: Astrology is nonsensical.</title>
    <original_poster>GSGhostTrain</original_poster>
    <original_post>To head off some initial arguments, I want to be clear that I understand many, many people engage in astrology as a sort of fun "horoscope only" type of activity. That's fine, and I don't begrudge anyone that. However, having encountered some people who buy further into it, including star charts for significant others being required, or making decisions based on astrological positions, I have always struggled to understand this belief. 

To date, I have never heard an explanation of *why* the position of the stars and planets would have any bearing on mood, personality, behavior, or anything else beyond potentially the weather -- only what the supposed effects *are*. I would like to better understand what the supposed causal chain is between the positioning of the planets and verifiable outcomes.</original_post>

    <text>I guess its not really about racional or scientific causal correlations you know? Its about a structure of meaning and a deep comprehension of human personality. Astrology is more than 2000 years old. To do a profound analysis of of an astrologic chart is quite a technical and intellectual challenge. Have some respect, even if you dont think it can be considered knowledge, value it at least as culture.</text>
