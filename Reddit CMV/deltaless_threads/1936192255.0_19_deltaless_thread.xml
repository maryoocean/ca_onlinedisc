    <original_post>I'm sorry but as an artist and painter it grinds my gears when I see all these tik toks with artist wasting paint. I understand splatter painting to a degree. A few droplets aren't going to kill anybody but when it is just people throwing paint cans and it ect it's ridiculous. It's pretentious and honestly your not really making art. Your making just a mess and it's incredibly wasteful. 

In the age of environmental destruction paint is one of the worst and most toxic things you can emit into the world. There's been multiple articles and studies on how it facilitates climate change and all manner of other issues! If you're going to use a resource like paint use it efficiently!

If you don't you're kind of an ass.

Shit my link wasn't saved. What I mean by wast is this art trend https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRM7gN4y/?k=1</original_post>

    <text>"Art" is the joy of changing the world around us in ways that make us feel alive. Sometimes art is pleasing to others. Sometimes it takes skill and time to accomplish and carries hidden meanings. Sometimes someone just wants to feel alive and make a mess, and to me that also is beautiful.

We are here to touch the world and feel joy, not to make money and impress strangers with dye and cotton stretched over wooden frames.</text>
