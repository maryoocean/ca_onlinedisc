    <title>CMV: Pregnant women should be automatically registered to donate their afterbirths for stem cell research (with an opt-out option).</title>
    <original_poster>Ragdoll_Proletariat</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm a Catholic and my father received stem cell treatment a few years ago. It massively improved his quality of life. I learned shortly beforehand that a woman's afterbirth and its core blood contains a lot of stem cells which can be used, to the point that women can actually donate them. I think this should be made an automatic process because of the following reasons:

1. There's no religious debate about harming an embryo because the baby has already been born, meaning that Christian women could help move this forward.
2. Afterbirths normally go in the bin which is a waste of stem cells.
3. Most women don't know this is an option so wouldn't opt into it.

I believe this would hasten research opportunities and consequently medical developments.

I write this with the caveat that women who want to eat it/frame it/etc can opt out in the same way as with UK organ donation. I'm not a doctor of course so I'm wondering if there's anything I'm missing here. I'm interested in seeing people's thoughts on this.</original_post>

    <text>Placenta donation costs a hell of a lot of money - the only way this would work? Making it not cost money.</text>

    <text>I'm in the UK where we still have the NHS for now so in theory it wouldn't be expensive to the donor.</text>

    <text>Even in the UK, placenta donation can cost money as it’s normally a private, ‘nonessential’ service (I’ve had UK friends who wanted to but couldn’t because the cost is so prohibitive). I’m in the US and it would’ve cost my husband and I double his YEARLY salary.</text>

    <text>Is this to donate the placenta or to retain it and release it for their children later in life?</text>
