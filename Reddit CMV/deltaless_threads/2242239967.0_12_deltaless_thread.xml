    <title>CMV: Religion is just Peer Pressure from Your Parents</title>
    <original_poster>siddharth_pillai</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't think most people believe in their religion. Nor do they believe in the gods they worship. They simply believe in whatever their parents believe. If you're a theist reading this, ask yourself whether you'd still follow your current religion if your parents were Islamic?

You can speculate yourself, don't you think its more likely that you would be Islamic too? If your parents were Hindus, wouldn't you be a Hindu? If your great grandparents were Sikhs wouldn't your parents and in turn you also be a Sikh?

It may not be true for all but its true for an overwhelming majority of people.

Edit: I'm getting some answers asking about people who convert or have non religious parents, my views don't apply to these people</original_post>

    <text>Then you’d have to ask yourself about ex cons or drug addicts who changed their lives for the better by finding religion. There was no pressure from parents in those cases. Only the will to want a better life. I’m not religious anymore but I do understand the benefits of it. There are also downsides as well but that’s the case with any belief system. Fanatics will give any group a bad name.</text>
