    <title>CMV: Kink and BDSM should not be at public pride events and should be kept for 18+ ones</title>
    <original_poster>akoudagawaismywaifu</original_poster>
    <original_post>To start, I am a lesbian. And I've been seeing recent controversy about this topic. 

Look, no denying that kink plays a big role in the creation of pride. It is a part of embracing sexuality and shouldn't be excluded from the community. 

However, it should not be at public pride parades. Pride should be for everyone of all ages. Many people say "stop catering to the straight capitalized ideal of what pride should be" and "pride isn't a party, it's a protest don't police us" and "children should go to disney if they want family friendly" This has nothing to do with straight rainbow capitalism. I figured out I was LGBT at age 11 and trust me if I saw a kink act in public I would be kind of disgusted. I'm still a minor now, and I'd be less disgusted but still. I know people say that it's up to you to bring your children to pride, but by making all pride events "wear whatever you want even if it's nothing" we are also kinda excluding minors from it. It's also non consensual to anyone who is exposed to such acts, because nobody wants to go to pride to see naked people right? The "think of the children" phrase holds true here. Young children and teens embracing their sexuality shouldn't be forced to see adult acts against their will. 

Again, no denying the role kink plays in the community, but it should be kept at 18+ events. There should definitely be a separate pride for people who just want to do leather and other kinks. That way, you can do whatever you want in a safe space where you know you won't offend others, and because people consented to come to an 18+ event, it's all good. 

That's just my personal opinion on it, but it seems to be the minority. I'd like to see how you guys think about this.

Edit: it appears after reading and responding to several comments, I don't really have a problem with kink, but more with public indecency. I don't care if you wear a collar or leather pants. But I'd rather not see things that could get you arrested or questioned for doing in public.</original_post>

    <text>I've read in other similar threads that the Kink community was one of the first to support Pride and LGBTQ rights. Both were considered "perverse" by a lot of the public way back, so I guess it was a matter of having a common opressor. I don't think, with that it mind, its fair to say that Kink isn't part of the protest.</text>

    <text>They were oppressed because in the 60s and 70s people were literally being arrested for dressing as the opposite gender (one example of many). That's why pride started. Because it was the one day they could be who they were, in numbers large enough that the police couldn't do anything.</text>

    <text>Engaging in consensual kink could still get you blamed for your own murder, get your kids taken away, or land you in jail.

    <text>You’re really not helping yourself. In one of those links a girl died being choked by her partner during sex. In another a man is being investigated for showering with his daughter. Another one talks about laws that make domestic abuse illegal being discriminatory against BDSM. Like what even?

You’re not helping your case. You’re showing how dangerous those activities are, especially involving children.</text>

    <text>My "case" had nothing to do with the safety of BDSM or exposing children to it, it was in response to your claim that people practicing it aren't facing any bias as a result.</text>

    <text>The bias that child molestation and killing your partner during sex is wrong? Yeah, I’m pretty okay with that.</text>

It's not a protest anymore.  We're ALMOST to the point where people think nothing of it at all, as it should be.</text>

    <text>Lol say that to all the trans people still fighting for their right to use the same goddamn toilet.  

Say that to all the intersex kids being put through unnecessary surgeries to 'normalize' their bodies.

Say that to LGBTQIA+ people of color, who are less likely than their POC peers to be able to find work and housing and are WAY more likely to be killed.

The right to get married isn't the end of the fight, it was just one of the first legal victories.</text>
