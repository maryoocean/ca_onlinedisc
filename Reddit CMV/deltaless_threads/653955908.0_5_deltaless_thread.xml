    <title>CMV: Equastrian sports should not be part of the Olympics.</title>
    <original_poster>LarryAndBarry</original_poster>
    <original_post>The Olympics in my opinion, is to challenge the boundaries of a humans physical abilities and see who is the best of the best. Its amazing what the human body is capable of when pushed to it limits.

I understand the same level of commitment goes into being a horse rider, but I feel as though equastrian sports is more a test for the horses. In theory, a javelin thrower can use any type of javelin but still throw a winning shot, but a rider can't really do the same with which horse he/she will use, therefore relying heavily on the horses ability to perform as well as their own. In the same vein, why not include the traditional horse racing with jockeys into the Olympics. </original_post>

    <text>I think you'll find that both historically and currently, the Olympics have been about more than just pushing the boundaries of human physical abilities. Historically this is really easy to see: there used to be medals for sculpture and literature and other arts. Today there are plenty of Olympic events where choreography or skill or strategy matters at least as much as physical ability. Hell, there's been a push to add chess as an Olympic sport and it probably would happened long ago if they could distinguish amateurs from professionals.</text>
