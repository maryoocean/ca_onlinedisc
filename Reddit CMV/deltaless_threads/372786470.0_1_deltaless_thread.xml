    <title>CMV: Kids today are losing the ability to express themselves effectively</title>

    <original_post>Since writing is an important tool of communication it is important to learn the process without the help of paraphrasing from the writings of others and arriving at ideas naturally. most kids don't write using their own ideas, they search the internet and arrange the writings of other people into an essay. The effect of this method of writing papers is harmful because if they don't arrive at ideas naturally and write them in their own words they will not be able to write or know proper grammar without the help of technology. </original_post>

    <text>Is expression purely written? Can an artist or musician not effectively express themselves?</text>

    <text>When I use the term "express" I mean it in the sense of conversing with another person and getting your point across in an effective manner. I believe writing out your thoughts is a skill that helps you speak to other people more effectively but only if you write using your own thoughts and knowledge on grammar. Since most kids essentially arrange information written by other people when they write papers the skill of effective communication isn't as well developed.</text>
