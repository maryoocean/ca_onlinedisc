    <title>CMV: The "root" of the US healthcare crisis could simply be the food we eat.</title>
    <original_poster>godlike_hikikomori</original_poster>
    <original_post>Yes, we do have a crisis with healthcare costs/medical bills. Insurance and pharmaceutical companies are major players. However, I believe the root of the "health crisis" in America is in our food/diet. Many peer reviewed studies have shown that the US population's obesity, diabetes,and cancer rates are at multi decade highs, compared to other countries. Policy experts must focus on making the whole medical system more cost efficient and more focused on functional/holistic health. Enforcing food and environmental regulations are a must. Also, many low income communities do not have the money to afford healthier foods, and some of them live in food deserts. Society should encourage people to avoid and overcome chronic illness so that they can avoid the hospital beds in the first place. This system may allow Americans to actually rely less on healthcare, and this could decrease the amount that taxpayers have to pay for Medicare. Heck, the life expectancies in Korea, Japan,and Singapore are much higher than in the states. Their cultures all promote good diet and exercise. The conversation of reforming healthcare should boil down to this question: Would you want to live a life where you constantly have to rely on pills and hospital visits, instead of improving your overall, long term health?

You can disagree with me on this view,and I may be wrong. However, no one can deny that there are many studies that support the claim that US leads the world in chronic illnesses, and something has to be done about this eventually. In my own spare time, I have studied deeply about how the advent of fast food/junk food actually came about. The history of fast food in the states actually spans from gaining mid- Western farmlands during Manifest Destiny, to the gov't allowing more food to be produced from more acres of land during the post WW2 period, to Big Agra and Food constantly lobbying the gov't, and to the rise of fast food joints in all 50 states. If you study the effects that junk food and food additives have on the body, you would come to understand that it's really not a pretty picture. I just believe that we should be more focused in actually making people healthier in the long-term. To be frank, I strongly disagree with many of the policies put forth by virtually every politician with regard to healthcare. They all seem to ignore how the food we eat can impact our long term health, even though they all have their own merits when discussing the other aspects of the healthcare crisis.

What are your thoughts on how we solve our health crisis?</original_post>

    <text>Food obviously plays a huge role. But other factors are also dramatic, albeit less clear to identify. I'm going to point out three of them.

First:

&amp;gt;U.S. infant mortality rate is 5.9 deaths per 1,000 live infant births, while the average rate of infant mortality among the OECD countries is 3.9 deaths per 1,000 live births.

[https://www.americashealthrankings.org/learn/reports/2018-annual-report/findings-international-comparison](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/learn/reports/2018-annual-report/findings-international-comparison)

See also [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_infant\_and\_under-five\_mortality\_rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_infant_and_under-five_mortality_rates)

&amp;gt;The US has the "highest rate of maternal mortality in the industrialized world."

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal\_death#:\~:text=The%20US%20has%20the%20%22highest,17.8%20per%20100%2C000%20in%202009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death#:~:text=The%20US%20has%20the%20%22highest,17.8%20per%20100%2C000%20in%202009).

I take it to be rather obvious that infant mortality is not directly linked to food unless you are literally starving and it seems unlikely that maternal mortality is linked to it very strongly, unless maybe we are talking about severe obesity. It is most likely more related to ***access*** to healthcare, i.e. getting proper testing and safe medical procedures.

Second: Another point would be driving. All other things being equal: the more you drive, the more often you are in danger of getting into a potentially crippling accident. The US has not only more drivers than the rest of the western world, but also much longer distances traveled per person. Since there are multiple factors at stake (traffic systems, quality of cars available etc.), my brief google search has not yielded a decisive statistic on this topic, but I would bet that driving is a major of decreased life expectancy, increased health care costs, and chronic illnesses.

Third: The military. About 20k soldiers have been wounded in Afghanistan, about 30k in Iraq. Taking often undiagnosed PTSD into account, the actual number would be much higher.

Food would be a big factor here as well, but how decisive is it in contrast to lack of proper healthcare in the first place and the other two factors? That seems to be a question that only actual experts could answer.</text>

    <text>Also, more driving in general tends to be linked to a sedetary lifestyle, which ain't good.  Even bussing means you are probably walking to/from the bus stop.</text>
