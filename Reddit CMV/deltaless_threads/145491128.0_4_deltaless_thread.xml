    <title>CMV:Segregated ( by gender) workplaces would lead to improved productivity.</title>
    <original_poster>hastyanon</original_poster>
    <original_post>I created this throwaway as I know this is a controversial and sexist opinion but it is one I have built up after 15 years of working in various environments. I would love someone to show me how I am wrong on this (preferably with some research to back it up) but in my experience, male-only (or almost male-only) work environments have been more on-task, have fewer issues of bitchyness and non-work related office disagreements, and generally more professionalism. I have worked in software development where teams/departments have frequently been 99% men and also worked in other office environments with a more equal mix. I see office politics in both situations but in offices with a greater number of women I have noticed a significantly greater quantity of personal issues becoming involved (relationships/friendships/personal disagreements etc). These frequently affect staff turnover and productivity. I can't comment on female-only environments as I have never worked in one, but would love to hear from those that have. I don't think women are any different to men in terms of productivity but from what I have seen the combination of men and women at work in an office is less than ideal. I'm looking forward to hearing your arguments and opinions. Please help me to change my view!

    <text>Just as I wouldn't trust a group of older white males analyzing the next hot hip hop / pop music acts, I wouldn't want an all male company trying to interpret a world made up of 50% male/50% female. 

Also not sure where you work, but where I work at (I'm a finance analyst) the women are just as professional, insightful, and productive as the men here. There are no differences. I'd say we have an equal mix of female and male upper level leaders as well, and both sexes contribute to the company equally as effectively. 

What is your evidence that your experience applies to all?
