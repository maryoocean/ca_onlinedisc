    <title>cmv: Canada should install dirty atomic bombs in each big lake as an invasion deterrent.</title>
    <original_poster>maxi1134</original_poster>
    <original_post>With the upcoming climate changes and the fact that Canada has 20% of the freshwater reserve in the world. Russia, America, and other states might have an interest in invading Canada to access the water reserves and the Canadian north that will taw out and become available for crops.    
  

With this information, I believe that rigging the water table to be radioactive for eons in case of invasion would be the perfect deterrent to prevent the invasion from any other state.   

  

Especially America, as their water table would then also be contaminated</original_post>

    <text>You... want to destroy the water supply for future generations, destroy the environment for eons, kill millions of people with cancer, kill millions of animals, and reshape the world... to keep the water to yourself that... won't be usable anyway? 

The phrase "cut off your nose to spite your face" comes to mind. 

I'm picturing a cartoon villain a la Dick Dastardly rubbing his hands together and cackling while saying, "If I can't have this water, NOBODY CAN! Muahahahahaha."</text>
