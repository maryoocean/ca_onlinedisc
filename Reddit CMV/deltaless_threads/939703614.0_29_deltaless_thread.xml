    <title>CMV: Where your born doesn't matter and country pride is pointless</title>
    <original_poster>Blank-VII</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't think I belong to a country and I think the concept is odd. I was born in the UK and have lived here all my life, but I fail to understand why people are so hard-core about being a 'proud brit' or anything. Where I was born isn't something I was able to decide for myself, and I want my life to be what I make out of it, not what it decides for me. I believe the only way to belong to a country is to find one whose culture is similar to your own tastes and opinions, and to move there. What's the point in being proud of a country I was born in if I feel no attachment to how it's run or anything else?

*you're

*View partially changed. Country pride is not pointless.

**Main view unchanged, it seems no-one can quite convince me. I've had some fantastic conversations and I'm really happy with how many of you engaged without being toxic. Stay safe y'all. Thanks so much!**</original_post>

    <text>Where you're born absolutely matters.  If you're born in the US life sucks but you'll live; if you're born in Somalia life doesn't suck, it's straight up life and death.</text>
