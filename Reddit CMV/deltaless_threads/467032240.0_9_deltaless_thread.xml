    <title>CMV: Dating is like finding a job, it isn't good to put all your eggs in one basket.</title>
    <original_poster>nerdywiththeword</original_poster>
    <original_post>To start off, dating is pretty like the job interview in a relationship. you guys are conversing to see if there is a potential fit for each other. If it is successful then there is going to be an offer for a relationship; if not then either the two is going to be friends or merely walk away and say goodbye without staying in contact.

Like job hunting, one should always be vigilant. When it comes to finding a relationship, one should focus on scheduling as many dates as possible to maximize their chances of being in a relationship. It is not wise to only stick to focusing all your attention onto one person because there is a big chance it wouldn't work out. Instead by talking to as many people as possible you are spreading your eggs in multiple basket and improving your chances at beating the numbers game.

This resonates well with job hunters since doing so many interviews (Or in this case talking to many potential people) will give you more opportunities to improve and sell yourself better down the road. I remember doing like 10 interviews before getting my first job. Each interview I improve upon one another and I feel this could be applied to dating.

Another reason not to put all your eggs in one basket is to be better mentally prepared when the date doesn't workout. You have another person to look forward to meeting so you won't feel too down.

    <text>Dating requires dedication, to really get to know each other. You're comparing dating to interviews, whereas it is more like internship. How do you think you'd fair taking on 3 or more internship at once?</text>

    <text>No one really commit to 3 internships at the same time. You would get burn out on top of school. You do one internship at a time while you are at school. That is not the right comparison in my opinion.</text>

    <text>Exactly, no one really commit to 3 internships at the same time because you can't and was exactly my point.

You can start many friendships at once, which is closer to the interviews you stated. No strings attached, getting to know each other.

In dating, you'd also get burnt out. You go out with this girl at lunch, that girl for dinner, and if you happen to meet the other girl you're dating while on a date, they'd both question your motives, which is exactly like internships. Bosses will also question whether you're serious about working there and most likely not bother and teach you.</text>
