    <title>CMV:Stalin was a bad leader</title>
    <original_poster>BRINGITSISTA</original_poster>
    <original_post>Hello! I have recently become a communist, or more specific a marxist leninist. But that is not what you will be changing today.

I hear many leftists and communists proclaim that Stalin was actually a really good leader and his negatives are exaggerated or fake....

Despite this, I still seem to have a somewhat negative view of Stalin

Yes, my image of Stalin has been improved by some communists I have encountered, but int quite there yet...

Instead of small one liners, I would like someone to write me a good, well rounded summary of why I should like Stalin

I know this might be controversial, so lets keep it to just communists and pro-Stalin people to answer this one...
