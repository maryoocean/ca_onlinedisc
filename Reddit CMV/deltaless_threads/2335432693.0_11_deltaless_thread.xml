    <title>CMV: all (US) roads that are not highways between cities or states should only have a single, one-way, lane of civilian traffic or less.</title>
    <original_poster>Square-Dragonfruit76</original_poster>
    <original_post>The main reasoning for my argument is because there at this point has been consistent, replicated, research finding that the more roads you add, the more traffic is actually _increased._ It would be a rough transition at first, but in theory, traffic would be diminished if you cut down the number of roads and the number of lanes. This would be great for the environment but it also would be great for everyone driving because there would be less traffic. The lanes that are no longer in use could be used to improve our society in a number of ways. They could be made into trees or park area. They could be restricted to only delivery vehicles and/or public transit or emergency vehicles. Or they could be made into bike paths. And if all goes well, perhaps people would even be open to eliminating some roads for civilian traffic all together.

Edit: Again, to reiterate, according to all the current research, more roads actually _create_ more traffic. So if anything, this would reduce traffic, maybe not immediately, but over time. A lot of people seem to not have read that part, so I'm not going to respond to repeats of people who clearly did not read my argument.

    <text>Could you clarify whether more 'traffic' here means more vehicles (or vehicle-miles), or more congestion?

Your linked is paywalled btw.</text>

More congestion

Sorry about that. I linked that specific one because there are multiple news articles about this phenomenon, but many of them cite that study so I figured it would be better just to give the study.</text>

    <text>Cool, thank you. It looks like the phenomenon studied is *urban* road capacity, and possibly urban roads specifically in places with congestion issues.

Most roads here in the US are rural and don't face congestion issues. Many urban areas don't have congestion issues either. Personally, I've never lived somewhere in the US with congestion issues**. It's difficult to imagine that fewer roads would be an improvement in most places, even if it would work in, say, LA or Chicago.

**actually, in the town where I currently live there are congestion issues on about four roads for two three blocks for a few hours on Saturdays there's a college football home game. It seems doubtful that eliminating one or more of those roads would help, since they're the four surrounding the stadium.</text>
