    <title>CMV: It's stupid to care about the environment in space.</title>
    <original_poster>MostRecommendation84</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm a big proponent of space colonization/exploitation and every time I bring it up there's someone who says something along the lines of "Oh we're gonna trash the Moon like we did Earth?" "Oh good more mining!" "Humanity won't rest until we've exploited everything we can!" and other snide comments to that effect. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Honestly, it just sounds like the dumbest argument to me and I wouldn't even be bothering with a CMV if I hadn't heard it so many times. *It's rocks. Uninhabitable barren rocks floating through vast chunks of literally* ***nothing****.* There's no space squirrels to worry about, we haven't found any aliens and we really have no reason to assume any are out there, let alone that they give a shit what we do to Mercury. Furthermore, you want to stop desertification or the human rights violations of cobalt mining, you're gonna be hard pressed to find a better solution than the absurd volumes of water and cobalt from here to the asteroid belt.</original_post>

    <text>There is definitely a difference between Earth and the moon - as you say, the latter is barren rocks.  However, that doesn't mean we want trash and industrial waste everywhere, even if we never terraform it.  The fact is that we need to learn how to do things with minimal impact not for its own sake, but because our current ecosystem requires it and because we are eventually going to settle on other worlds which might have their own ecosystems (whether we create it or not) that will need protecting.  If we're in the habit, as we are in large part today, of just blasting what we need out of the ground and leaving the mess it will be a lot harder to argue for restraint and conservation on those later worlds.</text>
