    <title>CMV: women are not going for the 'upper tier' of men</title>
    <original_poster>BadgerSame6600</original_poster>
    <original_post>I see this rhetoric over and over and over online, and hear it IRL sometimes.  It drives me crazy tbh. I am a man out in the world, living life, 35 years of it now. I have friends who are all over the spectrum of physical attractiveness. Some are single, most aren't. Their gfs/wifes are also across the spectrum. In most couples I know, friends and acquaintances,  the woman is better looking, earns more, or has more social skills ect. 

Now I know this is my experience, so it is anecdotal, but at the same time I just don't buy this whole women are too choosy. My opinion is that the dudes who say this are refusing to address their flaws and accept them. If these men believe this and they go out into the world feeling hard done by, fighting a losing battle, then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Most people can smell that level of victimhood a mile of. 

OK, open to have this challenge, so- change my view, Redditors! </original_post>

    <text>Your phrasing makes you seem wrong, even if you might be correct in your observations.

It seems you're assuming physical attractiveness is what is measured. For most people, especially for most women, that is not going to be accurate. A person is much more than a face and body. 

Another problem is that you seem to think talking about this tiering effect is some kind of complaint by men. That may be true coming from whining men, but they're still just talking about real phenomena even though they come from a weak place. The most widely attractive male in the world can also point out this tendency and it won't seem whiney, because it is to their advantage.

Another issue is that the context is mostly intended for online dating, where the top few percent of male profiles receive 90%+ of female interaction. This has always been true in dating, to a lesser and more hidden extent, but now it is well documented and amplified.</text>
