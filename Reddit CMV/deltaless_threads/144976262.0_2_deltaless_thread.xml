    <title>CMV: We could better manage agricultural resources if safe appetite suppressants were recommended (even supplied) by the FDA.</title>
    <original_poster>Soycrates</original_poster>
    <original_post>If the government began to suggest that appetite suppressants were a normal, healthy, and even recommended part of the daily diet for teens and adults of all ages (save extreme seniority), we would consume less agricultural resources on average, learn to better manage these resources to reduce starvation and hunger (when applied with humanitarian interest groups), the US populace would spend less money on healthcare, and people would choose their meals more wisely, opting for fresh and non-greasy food choices.

This is not motivated by a hatred or disdain for the image of people considered overweight or obese - some people would still appear to be overweight due to genetic and environmental factors, as well as the possibility for lack of exercise - and should not be considered a "the world would be better without fat people" opinion. The world would be better if we could learn to eat primarily for sustenance instead of pleasure. [Being overweight has been identified as a cause of cancer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight#Health_effects), and is projected to overtake smoking as the primary cause of cancer in developed countries as cases of cancer linked to smoking dwindle. Our health and finances would greatly improve.

We would reduce the amount of environmental damage that is caused by the agricultural industries as well, preserving land and water and creating a culture that could more easily foster eco-friendly practices and biodiversity.

The only people not expected to take appetite suppressants would be those whose RMR (Resting Metabolic Rate) was below normal.

    <text>The root cause of obesity is not necessarily ravenous, unstoppable hunger. Haven't you ever been bored-hungry? Where you want to eat, but aren't actually hungry? For people who've lost control of their diets, that's the root cause. The question is, then, why do they want to eat, if not because of their appetite?

There are a lot of possible answers. Some eat to distract, the same way a Redditor keeps scrolling. Some eat because it's behavior that's been normalized by their family members. Not many eat because of an honest-to-goodness hunger. Appetite suppressants wouldn't solve a thing; they'd eat straight through them.</text>

    <text>You might be able to argue that some people would "eat straight through appetite suppressants", but I think there's very little evidence to suggest that it wouldn't make a noticeable impact.

You don't just avoid doing something because it won't affect every single person on the planet as you want it to. I'd say it would affect *enough people* for it to be a worthwhile endeavour.

Also, I am not strictly talking about "obesity" here. And anecdotally I'd argue that plenty of people don't bored-eat unless they have some sliver or semblance of minute hunger. It takes the willingness to consume for most people; with a suppressed appetite, that willingness is diminished.</text>

    <text>As a fat guy who has been on ADHD meds that suppress your appetite for 9 years, I can tell you that what makes most people fat is their limitless stomach. Appetite suppression makes it much more limited. Being bored has very little to do with it over the long run. </text>
