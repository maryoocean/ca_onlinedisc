    <title>CMV: Sustainability, from a philosophical perspective, is misguided</title>
    <original_poster>Pyropeace</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've been an advocate of sustainability for a while. However, I've recently begun to question the underlying assumptions behind the sustainability movement. 

Nothing is truly, infinitely sustainable. The sun will eventually go nova, killing everyone on earth (if humans haven't already gone extinct by then). If humanity manages to escape Earth, then the universe will likely perish as well, depending on what model you accept. The universe is in a constant state of change, and nothing lasts forever. Is it better to be moderately happy for a long period of time or extremely happy for a short period of time? When talking about entire societies, I tend towards the latter, though on an individual basis I tend towards the former. 

Essentially, my question is this; what is the value in things that last a long time in a universe where nothing is eternal?</original_post>

    <text>You are misunderstanding the sustainability movement. Being sustainable is about earth in the near-ish terms (maybe hundreds to thousands of years), not on the millions or infinite scale. Being sustainable is about context, and for most people, the context is earth. But for example, in the ISS, being sustainable is including recycling pee, because they are on a space station where all water has to be brought up there. Why do astronauts recycle pee when eventually the universe will end? because bringing up extra water is hecking expensive. Why do us earthbound humans use less plastic when the universe will eventually end? Because oil (which is what plastic comes from) is a finite resource, and consuming it degrades the environment in which we live. 

You saying "sustainability is philosophically misguided" is liked saying "going to a doctor for cancer screening is philosophically misguided", it is nothing to do with abstract philosophy.</text>
