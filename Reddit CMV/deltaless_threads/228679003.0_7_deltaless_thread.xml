    <title>CMV: It should be illegal for the police in unmarked vehicles to pull people over for traffic offences</title>
    <original_poster>joelzundel</original_poster>
    <original_post>**Argument 1**


Imagine two cop cars driving along a motorway in opposite directions. One of them is marked, while the other is not. 

The unmarked one is going with the flow, which is usually a couple km/h over the limit, pulling people over. They only pull over maybe 4 cars an hour, and everybody else is not slowing down, simply because they can't see the police. From a civilian standpoint this creates a paradigm: the police are there only to collect money for the government. 

On the other side of the motorway, the marked police car is driving normally, and obviously nobody is overtaking them. Everyone stays safe and happy.

IMO: The police should do it's best to keep people safe, not collect money.

**Argument 2**

Some jackass buys a used police car, some lights a siren, and a uniform off Ebay. Drives around in unpopulated areas, pulling people over and robbing them/killing them/whatever other crime. The victim can not refuse to pull over - it's a very serious offence in most countries. It wouldn't be such a problem if traffic police would only use marked cars.

This is not accurate. It is not at all inappropriate to call the police station if you're being pulled over and ask for verification. Also, driving towards a more public and well-lit area is not impermissible.  As long as you are not attempting to flee or elude you do not have to stop right away. </text>

    <text>Drive until you get to a well lit place (i.e. a gas station) and pull in. If you call, then dispatch will rely the call to the officer. The police are not the deciders of guilt. If it gets as far as the court, simply tell the judge why you did what you did and it'll be fine.</text>
