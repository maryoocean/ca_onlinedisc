    <title>CMV: Democracy can be saved if the left learns to LIE better than the right</title>
    <original_poster>Preaddly</original_poster>
    <original_post>There are numerous challenges for which effective solutions are yet to be found. Individuals who hold the belief that a world without solutions is not acceptable may find themselves disillusioned by the lack of offerings of the left. Similarly, the right does not provide viable solutions, although it is inclined to fabricate false remedies that instill hope. While the left may easily disprove these proposed solutions, it often fails to provide alternative avenues, resulting in a sense of despair. 

For example, there is presently no established legal framework to enable individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds to accumulate sufficient wealth to secure financial independence. The right suggests curbing immigration to create job opportunities for Americans, but this solution is not feasible. However, the only alternative is enduring an arduous existence of living paycheck to paycheck for a staggering sixty-two years. 

Choosing not to address this issue isn't doing the left any favors. It's now to the point where right-wing charlatans are now waging war on democracy itself. They never would've been able to gain as much power as they have if not for the willingness to lie. 

Although the left may lack immediate solutions, there exists a cohort of opportunists ready to exploit this vulnerability. In order to inspire hope, the left must also be willing to present alternate narratives, even if they deviate from the truth. A demoralized population will be more prone to believing unfounded claims made by just about anyone, including the idea that democracy is ineffectual.</original_post>

    <text>&gt; Democracy can be saved if the left learns to LIE better than the right

They already lie more than the right wing. The left pretends that the government cares about the poor, or that millionaires like Bernie Sanders are not billionaires and therefore have the same interests as the poor.

Right wing goals always pretty straightforward, and right-wingers can actually deliver on what they promise. You want to fuck illegal immigrants over, you get fewer of them. You want abortion ban, you will get abortion ban. You want lower taxes? They will lower the taxes.

At the same time, the left lies about caring for the people. They lie that net neutrality is to protect the average Joe, while in fact Net Neutrality is Google/Amazon vs AT&amp;T/Comcast. They lie that they want more migrants because freedom of movement is good, in fact they want it because the capitalists want more labor. They lie that medicare for all is there for your average Joe, but in fact medicare 4 all is gonna allow privately owned healthcare organization to make much more money than they can. You collect taxes more taxes from the people, and give all that to a privately owned hospital. They talk about free education being a right, but what they actually mean that the government is gonna raise more taxes and pay it directly to universities, allowing more private corporations with a proper license to get more money.

Honestly, the real leftists can't be found in a government building, the real leftists are hiding in jungles and starting revolutions. Because a real leftist would never achieve anything in a capitalist country</text>
