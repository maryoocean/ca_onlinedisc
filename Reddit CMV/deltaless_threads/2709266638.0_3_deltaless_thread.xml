    <title>CMV: Gaza could be free if Hamas would stop attacking Israel</title>
    <original_poster>Ok_Contribution_6321</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm not trying to debate the whole Israel-Palestine conflict but just a small part and I'm very open to changing my view. My thought process is:

* Israel is not trying to settle/colonize/etc Gaza - quite the opposite given that they pulled out and removed settlers in 2005
* The blockade, border wall, and bombings are a response to attacks by Hamas (even if you consider them disproportional)
* Without giving up its territorial claims for all of Israel, Hamas could truly disarm, stop firing rockets and building tunnels, renounce genocidal claims, etc, and instead focus on putting all the aid money toward the people of Gaza
* If they did that in a verifiable way, Israel would have no justification for the blockade or attacks and Gazans could live in peace rather than an "open air prison" as some like to say

tldr; Gaza could have peace and prosperity if Hamas would stop attacking Israel. This would be without renouncing their territorial claims over all of Israel.

    <text>If they don't renounce their territorial claims over all of Israel, then Israel would still see them as an existential threat to their existence (Because, you know, they still say they want to conquer all of Israel) and would therefore likely keep at least some of these measures in place. Like, sure, you could argue they would have 'no justification', but people have been arguing they have had no justification to do the stuff they do for a while not. It hasn't stopped them before. 

More to the point, Gaza/Palestine would still not be a country even if Israel did remove everything, so I think most people living there would argue that they are not, in fact, free.</text>

Hamas is not claiming over all of Israel, there's nothing to renounce there.</text>

    <text>Which measures specifically would they leave in place though? I don't doubt they would still have the wall, iron dome, etc. The blockade began because Hamas was conducting arms shipments.</text>
