    <title>CMV: Public transportation should run 24/7.</title>
    <original_poster>Keep-reefer-illegal</original_poster>
    <original_post>We live in a world that is no longer 9-5. Businesses stay open later, friends can reach us with a portable device simply by typing on a mini keyboard. It doesn't make sense that public transportation isn't 24/7. Here are some reasons why it should be 24/7:

1. Very few buses run at 2 am for last call, I feel like if nothing else, running buses later let's responsible drunk people take public transit instead of driving home. 

2. It would benefit the working poor who may work night shift 

3. As mentioned before our world is now 24/7 

Those are my arguments. 

I encourage you all to change my view 

Edit: by transit I am including trains, buses, all forms of public transportation, not just buses.

    <text>San Francisco experimented with this. They found that they need a roughly 4-4.5h window to do maintenance and cleaning without service running. If they don't do that, then the work would take roughly three man-hours for every one man-hour if the system was shut down entirely. Not to mention that without that maintenance, the chance of equipment failure during peek hours tremendously goes up. This is because it is much less efficient to try to run daily maintenance while also running a functioning system. 

So, having established that a 4 hour window is needed, they looked at when to best do that shut down. They found that moving the window later, so that trains were available for those at last call, actually *decreased* ridership. The number of people that needed to get home from the bars is less than the number of people who need to be to work very very early in the morning. So while you and your demographic might like to have full service when the bars close, they found that an even larger number of people need to be to work at 6am. 

Have you ever heard of the adage "a stitch in time saves nine?" Well it's true. And when it comes to public transit, a few hours of aggressive maintenance will save triple the amount of maintenance done if the system is 24/7. </text>
