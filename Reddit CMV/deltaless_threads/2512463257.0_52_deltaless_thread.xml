    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>You may be justified in saying that the school shouldn't support a particular religion, but in a democracy with freedom of religion, if students are compelled by law to attend school up to a certain age, they should be allowed to dress religiously as long as it is not blatantly offensive and does not interfere with the rights of others to express themselves.</text>

    <text>Québec in no way prohibits students from wearing religious garnements. This thread is about allowing/allocating a dedicated space for prayer rooms.</text>
