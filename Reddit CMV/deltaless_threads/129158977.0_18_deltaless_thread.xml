    <title>CMV: I believe that abortion as a result of consensual sex (without contraception) is wrong.</title>
    <original_poster>BreakinMyBallz</original_poster>
    <original_post>I feel as though women who choose to have sex without the means of contraception, simply don't care if they get pregnant. They put their pleasures over the risk of having a child and having it terminated. 

I feel as though, when the sperm and egg mix, they create a completely new set of DNA, DNA that has never been the same in the entire history of our species and is a completely unique person (I'm not Theist, I try to base my arguments on the uniqueness of each person)

I don't see any way for someone to justify abortion when it is the result of sex without contraception. That woman simply did not care that new life was created within her, and chose to have sex in the first place. We argue it's a woman's choice for abortion? No, It's a woman's choice to have sex without the means of contraception.

-------
Clarification - I believe contraception is OK because new life with unique DNA and a unique person has not been formed and therefore will not be removed from the world.</original_post>

    <text>I think most people would agree that proper contraception is better than women getting abortions after the fact.  However, this is only a valid comparison *before* the start of the pregnancy.  

Once contraception is no longer an option, the comparison is between an abortion and carrying the unwanted and unplanned child to term.  Once you are comparing those two options, it becomes a lot harder to condemn the choices that others make.

I believe that having unprotected sex is wrong, but an abortion can be the best option left once the pregnancy has already started.  </text>
