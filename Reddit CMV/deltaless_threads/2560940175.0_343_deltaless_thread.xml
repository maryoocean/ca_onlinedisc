    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>I'll try to change your view:
I have been in this situation before, where someone called themselves an American and the person next to them called themselves a Native American and the next said "I am a US American". Now I am standing there, trying to fill in the nationality of everybody for the survey (some University Project). I am thinking, ok this is important, it should be correct and is getting graded, so I'll go full insensitive german and ask; "So everybody's from the USA?" And the answer is No. The Native American was from Mexico, iirc.
I am still not sure, if they were trolling me, but that is why I preferred the "I am US American." guy.</text>
