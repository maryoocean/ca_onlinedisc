    <title>CMV: "-but president Pense!" is not a good argument against impeachment.</title>
    <original_poster>Dr_Scientist_</original_poster>
    <original_post>This post assumes that Donald Trump has been found guilty of committing an impeachable offense. **A standard which hasn't been reached**. This is a purely hypothetical universe, different from our own, one in which Trump is conclusively guilty of committing crimes which would normally eject a person from being the president. 

I only bring this up because I often see people bemoaning, 'Oh but then *Pense* would be president' as if that would not be a dramatic upgrade from a convicted criminal. Pense seems to have no spine, abhorrent views, and his tenure as vice-president seriously undermines his credibility as a moral thinking person. His willingness to fly out to a football game, *just to leave it*, is hardly better than a humping lapdog. I don't think he belongs anywhere near the office.

However Trump has proven himself to be so disastrous, it seems inconceivable to me that Pense could be worse. It just doesn't seem plausible that Pense would surround himself family members as top advisers, pull dumbass stunts like a travel-ban without consulting legal council, resort to playground bullying like trying to illegally withhold federal dollars from sanctuary cities, get himself caught up in some Russian scandal, or some pornstar scandal, golf at his own resort every weekend, suggest doing away with due process, start a trade war, make asinine tweets threatening world war at 3am, fight illegal immigration with baby cages, or open his administration to the likes of Scott Pruitt and the whole goddamn swamp of lowlifes Trump has brought with him.

I totally get that he would likely appoint ultra-conservative supreme court picks, push back LGBT rights to the stone age, and may have chosen to abandon the Paris Accord /  Iran Nuclear deal all on his own. Again, he's not someone I would vote for. 

**BUT** *if* Trump ever were on the verge of being impeached, "-but what about Pense????" is not a good argument for tolerating a known criminal in office. 

This is something I feel pretty strongly about but whenever I try talk about it, I don't feel like I get much/any support for my view. 'Oh but what about Pense' is something I hear often from people whose opinions I respect. **Is there something to that argument?** Should I be more concerned about Pense maybe being a bad president if it's known that Trump already is one?

    <text>It's not an argument against impeachment. People bringing up Pence is more a reminder that the ultra conservative administration doesn't magically end if Trump is impeached (not saying whether it's good or bad, that's not my argument here. Every one can make their own opinions)</text>
