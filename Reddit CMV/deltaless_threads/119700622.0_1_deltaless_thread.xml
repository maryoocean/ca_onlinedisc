    <title>A warmer earth will be better for humanity CMV</title>

    <original_post>Here are my basic thoughts laid out.

I'd rather live on the equator as compared to antartica.

A warmer earth will be caused by the trapping of heat which means that antartica should heat up faster than the equator as heat flows from the center of the earth and less goes into space.

So even if some land is overtaken by rising sea levels more land should be livable.


Now to be clear this is not an argument against attempting to slow down and eventually stop global warming.  My main argument is that today's temperature is not the best temperature and that the "best" temperature would be higher than it is today.</original_post>

    <text>So, basically the argument is going to resolve around how much heat will increase the productivity of how much land, versus how much will be lost?

That seems more an argument of detail than a view to be changed.  

Assuming you do acknowledge there is a balance point, anyway.  

However, the real problem with the idea is that we don't have the control or understanding to do it.  It'd be like starting a fire when you have no idea what you're burning, and have no clue what the temperatures are around you.

Any change will be like that.

For example imagine if all global warming suddenly stopped today due to some unforeseen effect and the trend was reversed into global cooling.  Do you think that would be a good thing?</text>

    <text>I'm sorry, did you think I was unaware of that?   I just didn't think mentioning a refrigerator would be necessary, you weren't asserting that a cooler earth would be better, nor was I.
