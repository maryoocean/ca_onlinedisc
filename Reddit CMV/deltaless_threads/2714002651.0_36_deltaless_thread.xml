    <title>CMV: Capitalists hates the free market</title>
    <original_poster>SulemanDawood</original_poster>
    <original_post>Big businesses hat the idea of smaller companies rising up and challenging their market dominance which is why they try their absolute hardest to buy out every single startup they can. FAANG companies are notorious for this. They spend absurdly large sums of money which could be used to innovate on pointless mergers and acquisitions to avoid having to deal with the 'free' market. This is true even in the EU. The recent rise of Chinese EVs is driving european EVs out of the market and these companies are actively seeking to get them banned to save their own skins. Google, Amazon and Apple all continuously engage in anti-competitive practices to drive out competition because they can't deal with the fact that they can not innovate like smaller firms can. In the end capitalists are the ones destroying capitalism.</original_post>

    <text>I think OP understands the concept of competition, but not of free market.  


Free market just means companies can do whatever they want. That's an overgeneralization, but think of a black market--the ultimate free market.

If a company can get away with doing something, that's the free market in action. Pollution, murder, sabotage, companies have done these things multiple times in the past and getting away with doing it just means that the market is free.

Big companies pushing out little companies is free market because a powerful rich guy is going to get his way over anyone not as powerful or rich.

Companies HATE competition, but a "market" where they can do whatever they want? Love it.</text>
