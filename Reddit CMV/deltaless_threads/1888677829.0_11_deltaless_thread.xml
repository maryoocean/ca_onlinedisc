    <title>CMV: It's stupid to care about the environment in space.</title>
    <original_poster>MostRecommendation84</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm a big proponent of space colonization/exploitation and every time I bring it up there's someone who says something along the lines of "Oh we're gonna trash the Moon like we did Earth?" "Oh good more mining!" "Humanity won't rest until we've exploited everything we can!" and other snide comments to that effect. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Honestly, it just sounds like the dumbest argument to me and I wouldn't even be bothering with a CMV if I hadn't heard it so many times. *It's rocks. Uninhabitable barren rocks floating through vast chunks of literally* ***nothing****.* There's no space squirrels to worry about, we haven't found any aliens and we really have no reason to assume any are out there, let alone that they give a shit what we do to Mercury. Furthermore, you want to stop desertification or the human rights violations of cobalt mining, you're gonna be hard pressed to find a better solution than the absurd volumes of water and cobalt from here to the asteroid belt.</original_post>

    <text>when people say such things, they usually dont really care about space littering. they just care about displaying their allegiance to whichever side is popular in their monkeysphere, spouting shit that will give them validation from strangers on the internet. like reddit's karma system but more abstract. if youre expecting well reserched conclusions from anyone, youre dreaming. you yourself probably dont have a solid background on space debris and its possible impacts on future humans, partly because we havent fucked up space junk enough that its a problem, and partly because youre not a space junk technician. 

your assumptions, the ones youre aware of and the ones youre not, are not any more or less valid than those of the people you disdain so much. im almost certain that neither you or these people are experts, or even somewhat informed in tangential industries. 

lets say people colonized mars, and littered everywhere. would you want to live in a colony where there's shit everywhere? ok, lets say they litter away from settlements. what if the metal detector tech they use to find metals to mine get confused from foreign metals introduced by just throwing shit everywhere? what if heavy metals leach into the ground, and Mars farmers in the future have to deal with more shit in their land just because some ancestor was lazy and perhaps even left snide comments about how littering is actually ok. what if some dumbass takes pictures of 'signs of intelligent life' and it turns out its just some weirdly-shaped space junk someone left somewhere? what if its an asteroid and no ones there but the miners, but the miners just want a neat workplace and not have junk everywhere? ok lets say a planet has been mined to the bones and everybodys leaving. maybe it would be ok to litter then because nobody would be left to care. what about future historians, returning hundreds of years from now? what if some previously useless material becomes integral to a new industrial process, and now the shitty planet becomes a desirable planet to live in again. now they have to sort out the trash first. what about nuclear trash? 

this is just from ten minutes of thinking. theres a bunch of reasons why someone might want a neat place. Even just a designated landfill of planetside junk would be better. Why are you so opposed to the idea of keeping trash neatly in one place instead of the marginal, selfish convenience of throwing shit anywhere?</text>
