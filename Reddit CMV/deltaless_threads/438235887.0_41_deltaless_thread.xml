    <title>CMV: If gender is a social construct, then so is race</title>
    <original_poster>BoppeBoye</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let us take, as a given, that gender is divorced from the circumstances of your birth, that it is not a mental illness, and that there is no biological basis for what gender identity someone should express. Have I phrased that effectively? I'm trying to be concise, but I want to portray that premise correctly.

Why, then, should race be different than gender? If race carries with it "shared experience" and "lived experience", etc - that assumes that the only way you could understand what it's like to be a minority is to have lived your entire life as that particular minority. I'm not arguing against that, I agree that there are certain experiences that I could not comprehend - for instance, overbearing &amp;amp; strict Asian parents with exceedingly high expectations. 

But, if someone can change their gender or decide (?) that they identify as a different gender without having the prior lived experience of said gender, then why can't someone identify as a different race?

I'm not able to encompass all the variables which could lead someone to identify as another gender, but is it not possible for someone to come to the same conclusion with their race? What if an Indian man grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood, saw or experienced the same (or similar) discrimination as them, had minimal exposure to Indian culture; and this led him to conclude that he identifies more closely as a black man, rather than Indian? 

I would also like to cite Rachel Dolezal, who was uniformly mocked for being (afaik) the first trans-black woman in the public eye. It seems similar to transgender discrimination to me, assuming that there is something wrong with her mentally for deciding to become a black woman... Anyway, I'm not really defending her because that's not really in line with what I described in the previous paragraph (she grew up privileged IIRC), but the public reaction of mockery goes against the leftist belief of acceptance, by my perspective.

So, in short, why can there be no such thing as trans-racial people, the same way there are transgender?

    <text>Well, gender (at least in the way relevant experts use the term, as well as most on the left) is by definition a social construct.

I will explain. You have to agree that there is a collection of behaviors/characteristics linked to each sex that are caused by biology but rather the society we live in; there's mountains of evidence for this, and it goes pretty deep. An easy example of this is structural brain differences between males and females: older studies tend to show pronounced, predictable differences in certain capacities, such as spatial understanding. These differences have diminished over time, and now most of us have capacities that are mixed between what was considered to be a strong trend just a few generations ago. Another example is a study in which women performed worse on a math test when they were reminded that they were women (and without any implication that women were bad at math).

These characteristics and behaviors that are not caused by biological factors, and the amount of influence that social factors contribute to characteristics associated with either sex, are referred to as gender.

So when people say things like "sex is identical to gender", anyone with an understanding of the issue will read it as "all differences in male and female behavior and traits are caused by biology", which is easily demonstrated as false.

Frankly speaking, social conservatives simply need to accept the word gender to mean "the set of male and female behavioral and characteristic trends that are not caused by biology", because they don't have a word for it, which makes talking to them about it rather difficult.

On the race part of things, race isn't considered an important factor in genetics, since genetic variation within any racial or ethnic group is insurmountably greater than the differences between groups. Humans on the whole are remarkably similar genetically compared to other species as well (which is probably not good for our long-term health); our biological distinctions are minimal. Race simply isn't a valuable biological distinction, so I would lean towards any meaning it has being the result of a social construct, like culture, national borders, and any religion you don't happen to believe in.</text>
