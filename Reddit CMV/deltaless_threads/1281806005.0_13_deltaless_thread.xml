    <original_post>The GameStop squeeze carried out by r/wsb and others demonstrated the power of retail traders and seems like a fair punishment on market makers and hedge funds that have taken advantage of the stock market for ages, but there is no way that it will end well for them. Sure, a lot of stock brokers have lost millions on shorts because retail traders refuse to sell and are still buying, but they can afford to do so because they have enormous amounts of cash to rest on and because GME is clearly overvalued. GME’s market cap is several times its revenue, and the only reason it is that high is because of the artificial demand created by internet communities. At some point, sellers are going to fold and GME is going to collapse, and everybody that purchased it when it was overvalued is going to lose massive amounts of money, while Wall Street short sellers laugh their way to the bank.</original_post>

    <text>I am no expert so correct me where I have it wrong.

Let us pretend that there were 100 shares of GME outstanding in the market.  

The hedge fund Melvin (yes there were several but for this example I will make it be just one) short sold 136% of the outstanding shares.  They shorted 50 shares at $20, and 50 shares at $10, and 36 shares at $5.  This entire process cost him $1630 ($1000 + 500 +160).  Melvin only has $9000 left in account.

Internet randos of WSB said "dude!  lookiehere!" and they decided to start buying the shares.  the price goes from $5 to $30, and the Melvin does not want to complete his short sells because at $30 he loses money, instead he pays some interest to the people he borrowed the shares from for him to sell and waits.  But the price does not go down instead it goes up.  It goes up to $70 a share.  At this point Melvin would need $9520 to cover his short position and he does not have that much.  So he gets a loan from his friends for another $5000.  Melvin is sure these retail poor investors are about to lose it all here soon and he will still make a bunch of money.  Except now Elon Musk tweeted #gamestonks and now EVERYONE is paying attention to this.  The price goes to $250 then $300 then $350.  Wallstreetbets denizens are buying this stock.  Melvin and all of friends are on CNBC saying this is not fair.

So now we get **CMV: While the GME squeeze is a  powerful display of retail trader’s power, there is no endgame that  doesn’t result in them losing massive amount of money.** 

From here Melvin still has to complete his short sale, he must buy 136 shares.  At $300 he loses so much money he goes out of business.  Large investors that simply had GME shares sitting around might say "Wow, look at this, I am going to sell my 10, or 20, or 30 shares.  The problem for Melvin is that there is still a huge demand for those shares.  So much so that trading apps stopped allowing people to buy $GME.  There is still demand.  More demand means the price will still go up.

The price of $GME might jump to $400 or it might jump to $1000.  A some point, let's call it X, the price will be high enough that people with shares to sell will outnumber the WSB randos and their followers that want to buy.  Indeed it is something of a prisoner's dilemma in that eventually some of the WSB types will say "wow the price is so high I am going to sell now".  

Once the sell off starts I expect that the price will come down quickly probably around to where it was two weeks ago.  But during that sell off many of the WSB types will make some significant money.  Some will lose.  Some that lose money will not care.  They will be happy to put the screws to Melvin.</text>
