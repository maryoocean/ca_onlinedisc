    <title>CMV: Every straight girl out there secretly wants to date a rich guy</title>
    <original_poster>windmill230</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let's be honest here. Some girls say that they have no desire to date rich guys as they are looking for true love but really they are just lying. And as for girls who don't pursue rich guys, they secretly want to do this and the only reason why they did not do this is because they know that rich guys are out of their league.

Some people say that money is not a priority but really it is. Who doesn't want a rich husband who treats you nicely? "Money cannot buy happiness" is just a myth propagated by not-so-well-off people with a sour grapes mindset. The truth is deep down, everyone values money and secretly desires to be rich. I don't believe it when a girl says that she has no particular desire to date rich guys.

    <text>Lets not be explicitly sexist here, every person looking for a partner is looking for a partner that meets some sort of preference criteria.  In a very rough metric, intelligence, personality, attractiveness, and wealth do all play into many peoples' criteria, but how they weight those metrics will depend on the person.

To remove people from the equation entirely, think of it like looking for a place to live.  For some people, they want to live in the city, other people want to live in the country.  Some want houses - the bigger the better.  Some would prefer a cozy apartment that is near lots of bars and clubs.  Some would like a town home near the local park.  Some need a place they can host parties in, and some need a giant yard for their pack of dogs.  All things being equal, most people will go for the cheaper option, but things aren't all equal.

To bring the analogy back around, it doesn't matter if the house is 100 rooms, has a 50 car garage, in the middle of a country club, and completely free if you really want some place that you can walk to the bar and your office from.

Money is one element of a potential partner.  Having more money does make many parts of life easier, but if that partner doesn't meet your other criteria, it may be a complete nonstarter.</text>

    <text>I suspect a lot of women secretly want to "settle" with a rich guy who is not a douchebag though, and the only reason why they are not doing this is because they are out of their league.</text>

    <text>Are you talking what people fantasize about or what people are actually willing to cheat on / leave a relationship over?  The thing is that real life isn't like an RPG character creator where you get to build your perfect mate.  Real life people all have their upsides and their downsides, and there's some major transaction costs for abandoning one relationship for another.  Sure, there may be a rich non-douchebag appearing guy, but maybe he works 100 hour weeks when he's home and is on the road 70% of the time.  Maybe he seems non-douchy in the first few dates, but turns out to be a crazy control freak or gets bored of women after a few months.  For a long-term relationship, most women do want a guy that is able to be a good provider for the family, but they also want a guy they can connect to emotionally, trust implicitly, and be a good father for children.  If they can find a guy that meets all those criteria AND is rolling in cash, bonus.  Otherwise, it's not like most women will sit around trading up on men who make more money whenever they find one.</text>

    <text>Getting your fantasy or top goal in a relationship is not settling. Settling means accepting something less than what you would prefer. </text>
