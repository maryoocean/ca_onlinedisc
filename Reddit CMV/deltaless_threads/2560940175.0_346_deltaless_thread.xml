    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>I've heard the exact same thing from South American classmates, friends and coworkers over the years.

Not sure where that idea comes from. It's not like anyone else on the planet is out there wanting to call their selves "American" but can't because of the US. What would it even mean if everyone on an American continent called their self "American?"

Also, that version they're talking about is the name of two continents. Continents aren't culture. They aren't society. They aren't governments. Just hunks of mostly contiguous land. Taking umbrage with people from USA being called "American" doesn't make sense.

It causes 0 confusion in anyone.</text>
