    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>I'd like to add to the excellent points here by asking a question. ACAB is primarily an attitude in the United States, where police are especially unaccountable and where the highest rates of brutality against non-aggressive people are happening. If there is a VETERAN officer (has been on a force for a few years) anywhere in the USA who is still advocating against police brutality and corruption, what is that person's name? That person may be a "good cop" but I've never heard of such a cop even though I follow police accountability news.</text>
