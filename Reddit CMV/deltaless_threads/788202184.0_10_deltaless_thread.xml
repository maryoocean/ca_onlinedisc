    <title>CMV: Muslim is the superior ideology</title>
    <original_poster>eltrutekili</original_poster>
    <original_post>First off I need to preface this by saying that I am a straight white male who was born, baptized, and raised Christian. I've held various thoughts throughout my life, ones you could even consider "Islamophobic".

That being said, I've read and watched a lot of content on the internet about the supposed "decline of Western civilization". Basically, it is the concept that feminism and white displacement is causing the downfall of society. This is due to a variety of factors, not limited to but including single motherhood, promiscuity, and drug abuse.

One of the major side effects of such societal issues is the formation of niche, extremist groups such as incels and MGTOWs. I'm not saying MGTOW = incel, but their core foundations are rooted upon the same premise; pure frustration.

Now here's the kicker, everything I am mentioning is fully solved within majority Muslim populations.

Allow me to explain. I thought about this a while back and was reminded of it tonight. I had just finished watching the UFC fight (Dustin Poirier vs. Khabib Nurmagomedov), and was reminded of Dustin's last fight. After Dustin's last fight, his wife graced the stage to show support for her husband. I just need to say, this woman was wearing an open cut dress showing off her...how shall I put it..."melons".

I got curious, being the testosterone driven young man that I am. I Googled her and found her Instagram. Her Instagram is filled with photos of her wearing very little clothing and receiving a lot of male attention. One comment, however, caught me off guard. It was written by a Muslim who had pointed out that Dustin allows his wife to post all of these sexual photos for attention, but nobody has ever even seen Khabib's wife. Well, you can find pictures of his wedding, but she is in full garment covering everything including her face. This individual then said that this is how it should be, that Khabib is the only man to see her half naked, and you know what? I agree.

Now about my previous statement; the majority Muslim populations solving issues which can be attributed to the "downfall" of our society. Muslims have, for a long time, enforced very strict rules which attempt to not only subdue but control biological urges that are rooted in hedonism, deprivation, and outright evil.

For example, I mentioned incels. Well, arranged marriages not only remove the societal pressure of having to find and court a woman. It also ensures that both parties are pure, and their pair boding has not been demolished by one night stands and "hypergamy". Not to mention removing a lot of the social anxieties around said relationships.

MGTOW? Most of them ended up in this boat because they were completely fucked over by the family court system, or "divorce rape" as they call it. Yeah, divorce isn't a thing in Muslim countries. Once you're married you're married. Cheat on your wife/husband? You're in for hell.

One more note; I also mentioned drug abuse. I watched a Vice documentary on ISIS which followed actual Islamic State militants in order to see how they run things in the various small areas they control. They were riding with one of the leaders through a town. One thing I noticed was that they had stopped to check on a man who was just released from prison for...get this...drinking alcohol. They made sure he was alright and that he was not drinking. They checked his place and everything.

You might be thinking, "this is anti-freedom!", and you might be partially correct. However, I believe this is more a matter of principal. Do you discipline this man for doing something that will clearly destroy him and cause harm to those around him, or do you let him be "free", drink until he has liver damage, and get into violent altercations while intoxicated? 99/100 times I'm going with the former.

Here is where the Muslim superiority really starts kicking in. If you look at major institutions, companies, schools, etc. They all seem to be towing this social justice warrior narrative lately. White males are at the brunt of most accusations, and are being made to feel guilty about all types of things. Things like slavery, patriarchy, etc. It seems weird to me that a white supremacist patriarchal society would allow this type of thing to happen.

The funny part; Muslims have a solution for this too. It's actually quite ironic. All of these different forms of oppression are far more prevalent in these Muslim countries, but you never hear about it from SJWs. Quite the opposite, actually. This label of "Islamophobia" seems to be some type of bizarre shield against any criticism one might have of said cultures.

Which is another point; Muslims would never take this kind of shit. They have their culture locked down so hard that the mere idea of even being criticized by the very people who claim to be oppressed by patriarchy, despite the fact that the Muslim culture is extremely patriarchal, actually causes feminists to rear their heads in defense of said culture. It gets to the point where they even claim that forced garments are "empowering" to women.

That's the thing though. While these women are forced to wear this apparel, there's one thing that is certain; they will never be accused of being raped because of what they are wearing. This is my final point. They've effectively removed male biological urges by forcing the women to cover themselves. This minimizes women being looked at as nothing more than sex objects, and also ensures that their husbands are the only ones who have a truly intimate and unique connection with them.

It is for these reasons listed above that I believe that the Muslim ideology and culture is superior to all others. CMV.</original_post>

Stop watching alt-right propaganda.  It will rot your brain. 

&amp;gt;  ne comment, however, caught me off guard. It was written by a Muslim who had pointed out that Dustin allows his wife to post all of these sexual photos for attention,

The use of the word "allow" implies that he had the option to forbid her to do that.  He doesn't have the power to do that. He doesn't own her body. She can post whatever pictures she wants.  

&amp;gt; For example, I mentioned incels. Well, arranged marriages not only remove the societal pressure of having to find and court a woman. It also ensures that both parties are pure, and their pair boding has not been demolished by one night stands and "hypergamy". Not to mention removing a lot of the social anxieties around said relationships.

Arranged marriages trap women (and sometimes men) in relationships that they don't want. So congratulations, you have solved the incel problem, but you have just created thousands of miserable women who are forced to marry and have sex with men that they aren't attracted to and don't love. 

&amp;gt; MGTOW? Most of them ended up in this boat because they were completely fucked over by the family court system, or "divorce rape" as they call it. Yeah, divorce isn't a thing in Muslim countries. Once you're married you're married. Cheat on your wife/husband? You're in for hell.

No, they just kill the adulterous wife instead. That is so much better than divorce.  Oh, and do you know what happens to the adulterous husband? Absolutely nothing, because there is a massive double standard that exists in muslim fundamentalist societies.  

&amp;gt; You might be thinking, "this is anti-freedom!", and you might be partially correct. However, I believe this is more a matter of principal. Do you discipline this man for doing something that will clearly destroy him and cause harm to those around him, or do you let him be "free", drink until he has liver damage, and get into violent altercations while intoxicated? 99/100 times I'm going with the former.

This is absolutely anti-freedom. Furthermore, drinking is not something that will clearly destroy anyone. Alcoholism and drinking to excess are certainly problems. Drinking in moderation is not.  Lastly, there is the bodily autonomy issue. If an individual wants to destroy their body with excess drinking, then they should have that choice.  As long as they know the risk and consequences of what they are doing, they should have the right to do it provided they aren't endangering others in the process (drunk driving and such).  

&amp;gt; Here is where the Muslim superiority really starts kicking in. If you look at major institutions, companies, schools, etc. They all seem to be towing this social justice warrior narrative lately. White males are at the brunt of most accusations, and are being made to feel guilty about all types of things. Things like slavery, patriarchy, etc. It seems weird to me that a white supremacist patriarchal society would allow this type of thing to happen.

Again, stop watching the alt-right propaganda. 

&amp;gt; That's the thing though. While these women are forced to wear this apparel, there's one thing that is certain; they will never be accused of being raped because of what they are wearing. 

They will never be accused of being raped because of what they wear because rape is not taken seriously in traditionalist Muslim cultures. If a married women is raped, it is looked on as adultery and she is shamed and punished for it.  And by the way, it is completely legal for husbands to rape their wives in these countries.  

&amp;gt;  They've effectively removed male biological urges by forcing the women to cover themselves.

No, they haven't.  

&amp;gt;  This minimizes women being looked at as nothing more than sex objects, 

They are looked at even more as sex objects because their only purpose is to please their husbands. They have no rights or freedoms of their own. 

&amp;gt; and also ensures that their husbands are the only ones who have a truly intimate and unique connection with them.

By giving women no rights or freedoms to choose who they want to be intimate with.  

&amp;gt; It is for these reasons listed above that I believe that the Muslim ideology and culture is superior to all others.

Yeah, it might be superior if you are man who enjoys dominating and abusing women.  If you are a woman or man that believes in gender equality, then you are absolutely fucked over in a society like this.</text>

You're missing the larger point I made which is that using social media in order to acquire sexual attention and validation from other males destroys pair bonding and only creates dopamine highs of empty hedonism, which doesn't benefit their marriage or society whatsoever.

&amp;gt; Arranged marriages trap women (and sometimes men) in relationships that they don't want. So congratulations, you have solved the incel problem, but you have just created thousands of miserable women who are forced to marry and have sex with men that they aren't attracted to and don't love.

I agree with you that there are definitely issues with arranged marriages. However "love" is merely a chemical reaction in the mind. It often fizzles out over a short period of time. The incline of divorce rates in the world is evidence of that.

&amp;gt; No, they just kill the adulterous wife instead. That is so much better than divorce. Oh, and do you know what happens to the adulterous husband? Absolutely nothing, because there is a massive double standard that exists in muslim fundamentalist societies.

Adultery is strictly forbidden whether male or female. What you're saying here is completely innacurate. I've seen videos of men being struck with blunt objects by other men for cheating on their wives. They get socially ostracized.

&amp;gt; Furthermore, drinking is not something that will clearly destroy anyone. Alcoholism and drinking to excess are certainly problems. Drinking in moderation is not.

Drinking causes more problems than it solves. A majority of violence and crime is done under the influence of drugs, and alcohol is among the top of those ranks. Furthermore, alcohol isn't necessary whatsoever. Nobody needs to literally poison themselves to survive. You've also made a glaring contradiction by stating that drinking will not destroy anyone, and in the very next sentence stating alcoholism is a problem. You don't become an alcoholic without drinking.

&amp;gt; They will never be accused of being raped because of what they wear because rape is not taken seriously in traditionalist Muslim cultures. If a married women is raped, it is looked on as adultery and she is shamed and punished for it. And by the way, it is completely legal for husbands to rape their wives in these countries.

If a man rapes another mans wife then he is in for a world of shit. I agree with your second point though. That is definitely an issue.

&amp;gt; No, they haven't.

But to a large degree they have. If you have a society with no pornography or women flaunting their sexuality, this can be directly correlated with a reduction in male urges. For example, if I'm just scrolling through Reddit one day and randomly come across a picture of a woman in a bikini, I'd be way more inclined to jack off than if I had never seen said image.

&amp;gt; They are looked at even more as sex objects because their only purpose is to please their husbands.

This just seems completely incorrect. I was also speaking in a general societal sense, which means you would have to accept that a woman having sex with her husband is not only implied, it is required.

&amp;gt; By giving women no rights or freedoms to choose who they want to be intimate with.

This seems pretty off-putting at first but there are larger implications that may benefit society enormously. For example, STD rates, single motherhood, etc.

&amp;gt; Yeah, it might be superior if you are man who enjoys dominating and abusing women. If you are a woman or man that believes in gender equality, then you are absolutely fucked over in a society like this.

This is more an ad hominem attack than anything else so I won't address it.

Thank you for your reply.</text>

No, it isn't.  It's just evidence that access to divorce makes women less likely to stay married to people who don't treat them well.  Which should be a "well duh, isn't that a good thing?" moment, but every once in a while it becomes a "bad thing" to people who really don't like the idea of a woman being allowed to choose things.</text>
