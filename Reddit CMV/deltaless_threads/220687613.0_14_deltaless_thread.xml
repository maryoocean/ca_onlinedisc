    <title>CMV: Rap Music Sucks</title>
    <original_poster>chronicallyfailed</original_poster>
    <original_post>So it may just be that all the rap I've listened too has been bad, but I really can't think of a rap song or a song featuring rapping that isn't just unlistenably bad. 

The lyrics, even when they're not breathtakingly sexist and homophobic, tend to be boring, unimaginative crap along the lines of "my penis is big and I do drugs" - not that I have anything against songs about penises and drugs, just the way it seems to be done in rap that I've heard is just boastful and repetetive.

Musically, I just hear incessant, grating melodies played over a shitty drumbeat while someone talks over the top of it. A lot of the time I don't really see how it qualifies as music.

Also, the amount of ridiculous, pretentious crap in the music videos just makes it hard for me to take them seriously at all.

But I don't really want to just dismiss rap music like that, so please explain to me how it's not shit, and examples of it not being shit would be nice too.

    <text>Alright I'm going to give you a few songs to listen to and we'll see if they change your view. It sounds to me like you've only really listened to trap and gangster rap. 

These first two are pretty emotional songs

[Unconditional Love - Tupac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47isVenV0-0)

[When I'm Gone - Eminem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wYNFfgrXTI)

Songs with a less intense subject matter:

[My Oh My - Macklemore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvNQWQSwmow)

[Cinemetropolis - Blue Scholars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUidzvutFTI)

Impressive linguistic skills:

[Rap God - Eminem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbGs_qK2PQA) This has a bit of that long dick stuff you were talking about but it's definitely not just "talking." Jump to 4:20 if you've ever wondered what the fastest speed that human's can make words is.

[Through The Wire - Kanye West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvb-1wjAtk4) He actually recoreded this song while his mouth was wired shut after a car accident.

And then there's just funny stuff like [I Love College by Asher Roth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrDrCF-T88g) lol every high school senior takes that song too seriously and every second semester college freshman realizes that you never have the time for that shit.
