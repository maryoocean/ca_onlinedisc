    <title>CMV: The poor are the enemy of the rich</title>
    <original_poster>The_Saracen_Slayer</original_poster>
    <original_post>My contention is simple:  the poor are fundamentally the enemy of the rich and for the prosperity of the later, this maxim must never be forgotten. And whatever “compromises” are established between the two races are simply temporal practical concessions for creating a preferred balanced environment…but this does not solve the ultimate underlying conflict between the two.

I won’t base this claim much on socio-economic research since I find such disciplines to lack the sufficient rigor I value from applied math and statistics modeling (at least for these macro level claims). Instead I will simply use personal anecdotes and maybe some generalized historical events to support my claim.

Being rich is of course an objectively superior attribute. Even as a child I immediately knew the luxuries of the new rich inheritance  were vastly preferable to the environment of being poor. Only an imbecile would think otherwise. But it wasn’t until I lost my innocence did I understand the dichotomy that being rich caused between family and friends. The poor envy, that is universal truth. The poor will always envy the rich, and this alone will always be a destabilizing force between the two classes (for humility is unfortunately a lacking virtue in the vast majority of humans).

Because of this, the poor will inevitably always end up hating the rich and this will lead to violence if left untamed. We’ve seen it in historical events: slave revolts, seizure of property and of course good old revolutionary distribution of wealth movements. Furthermore, ideologies like egalitarianism or communist type theories are indeed weapons that can, and have, be used to seize the assets of the rich. 

The ultimate goal of the rich is to maintain their prosperity, and this requires looking at the reality of the situation. No matter the current system, the rich must always be vigilant for any populist movements…because they will all inevitably be used to take money away from us and give it to the poor.</original_post>

Yes, having valid and data with proper interpretation is very importa...

&amp;gt;Instead I will simply use personal anecdotes and maybe some generalized historical events to support my claim.

...uh wait,  never mind.

It's hilarious that you're simultaneously dismissing entire bodies of research because they lack what you deem to be sufficient validity, while basing your entire view on anecdotes and generalization that have *even less* validity.

    <text>I didn’t feel the need to include such evidence for my position for numerous reasons (see some of my other responses), but I never stated you couldn’t use them for your counter arguments. I just think they’ll be too tedious and time consuming to counter (not that I couldn’t). Nonetheless, if you feel strong about including them for your arguments then you’re free to knock yourself out.

The anecdotes and historical are easier to apply for universal claims that transcend geographical and time based factors. Whereas your beloved “valid data” is gonna be quite difficult to extend its relevant factors to contexts beyond its original research setting. But you know what, just for you…I’d love to see you try</text>

I was responding to the reason you did give:

&amp;gt;since I find such disciplines to lack the sufficient rigor I value from applied math and statistics modeling

which I found ironic when followed up with, "instead I will accept anecdotes and generalizations that have even less of those things I say I value."</text>

    <text>Did you forget to read the fine print: “at least for these macro level claims”. I specifically mentioned the context for you guys and you all just ignore it :(

Such approaches, from my arguments sake, wouldn’t really be that useful since I would have to try and apply them to settings/timelines beyond the original research environment. It’s not impossible but certainly not a easy feat to accomplish. And like wise, I would assume, if you or someone else tried to use them as a counter example.

Again I never specifically disallowed others from using such evidence in your rebuttals, so feel free</text>
