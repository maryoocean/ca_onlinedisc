    <title>CMV: The civil justice system is under-appreciated as a triumph of humanity</title>
    <original_poster>JamoWilliams</original_poster>
    <original_post>For context: I am a lawyer. I often get asked “can you sue someone for X”, “can you sue someone for Y”, “am I at risk of being sued if I do Z”?

Yes. The answer is always yes. You can sue anyone for anything at any time. I can walk into my office, hop make an account on my jurisdictions e-filing system, and sue my mom for emotional damages because she told me that she didn’t like the pants that I wore to her birthday party within 20 minutes. Whether I will be successful in my claim or not depends entirely on the evidence of the case, how that evidence is presented and contextualized by the parties, and the prevailing jurisdictional case law authority on how certain aspects of the claim, the evidence, or the prospective requested remedy should be decided upon or viewed by the Judge.

This is a reality that I feel is often lost on people who do not understand what the civil justice system actually represents: an ability, a *right*, for people to voice their complaints to a higher authority and say “I was wronged. Here is how I was wronged. Here is my evidence. Here is who I was wronged by and here is the remedy that I would like from the court”. The system is meant to be, and designed to be, just. That’s why it’s called justice.

In my view, the vast majority of people who say “the justice system is broken”, especially when meaning to refer to the civil justice system, do not at all understand the justice system, its procedures, or what it aims to do. Despite criticisms that one may have of the system, the fact that it permits anyone to have a chance to plead their case and show evidence is a triumph.</original_post>

Does *everyone* have that ability? Let's say I'm a poor single mom working two jobs and I've been wronged by a corporation. I can't afford a lawyer nor can I afford time away from work or my kids to go to court. The corporation, meanwhile, has experienced lawyers on retainer and basically limitless resources to fight my claim. How much "justice" do you actually think, realistically, I have recourse to?</text>

    <text>In theory, everyone has access to justice. Legal aid exists, and filing fees can be waived in extraneous circumstances. The party that has more money and a better lawyer (or lawyers) can leverage those inherent advantages if they are strategic during civil proceedings, but that does not mean that a blatant civil wrong or tort will not be treated as such by the system.

My above answer applies to situations like what you described - to parties with a big imbalance of resources to tap into. It should be noted that the majority of civil actions at your ever day city courthouse involve regular people or regular businesses suing each other.

Also, I have a background in insurance defence law. I can promise you that gigantic companies, like state farm or allstate, “lose” to regular people all the time.</text>

In theory, yes. In practice, it seems that you even recognize that it doesn't always.

Regardless, the important point in this is that the mere fact of civil justice as something people can access does not in itself garauntee that it furthers aims of justice -- you need a bunch of other things in place, like legal aid, and so on, even if we accept your claim that once you do have those things then the difference between the single mother of two and the giant corporation is entirely nullified.</text>

    <text>Yeah, the fact that justice is effectively up for purchase is a real limitation on how "just" it can plausibly be.</text>

    <text>The difference between the single mother of two and the giant corporation may not ever be able to be entirely nullified - but it is nullified to a sufficient degree such that a relatively equitable outcome is usually served in my experience.

Like I said - I have seen countless disputes where regular people (including single mothers with low income jobs) got a favourable outcome against a billion dollar corporation</text>

I mean, it easily could be. I can imagine in a society in which there are no private lawyers, all lawyers are government employees, with salries paid through taxes, and whose services are free to all.

The capitalist system is what undermines justice, it's not like inherent to the idea of civil law.</text>

    <text>That is a fair point. Many people may hold that fire and I think it has merit.

That being said, some lawyers are just flat out better than others. What you are proposing would mean that random people would get randomly advantages and/or disadvantaged depending on what lawyer is “assigned” by the state to them or to their opponent. That, also, allows the opportunity for corruption just as much as capitalism does.

Disparity in lawyer ability is not a failure of the system. It is a byproduct of doing business in a world where different people have varying levels of capability</text>

    <text>Nothing in what I've said presupposes the state would be assigning lawyers, so I'm not sure why you've made that assumption. They'd be like doctors under a socialized healthcare system -- the state pays them, but individuals still get to decide who their doctor is. 

So yes, that does seem more fair than "the best lawyers go to those with the most ability to pay."</text>

That’s a form of survivorship bias. Of course, the people actively involved in suing each other are typically roughly evenly matched with resources. 

But does that cover the majority of injustices actually perpetrated? Who’s not spending all day in the courthouse? The people who had no chance to begin with. The people who got $20 in the mail after their data was leaked, while the lawyers walked away with half the settlement. The people without access, wherewithal, or plain old time on their hands to get justice. 

Wage theft is the largest form of theft in the United States. In your theory, every dollar could be recouped with a “20 minute” lawsuit filing. Why isn’t it?</text>
