    <title>CMV: It's stupid to care about the environment in space.</title>
    <original_poster>MostRecommendation84</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm a big proponent of space colonization/exploitation and every time I bring it up there's someone who says something along the lines of "Oh we're gonna trash the Moon like we did Earth?" "Oh good more mining!" "Humanity won't rest until we've exploited everything we can!" and other snide comments to that effect. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Honestly, it just sounds like the dumbest argument to me and I wouldn't even be bothering with a CMV if I hadn't heard it so many times. *It's rocks. Uninhabitable barren rocks floating through vast chunks of literally* ***nothing****.* There's no space squirrels to worry about, we haven't found any aliens and we really have no reason to assume any are out there, let alone that they give a shit what we do to Mercury. Furthermore, you want to stop desertification or the human rights violations of cobalt mining, you're gonna be hard pressed to find a better solution than the absurd volumes of water and cobalt from here to the asteroid belt.</original_post>

    <text>The argument isn't about caring for the moon environment but caring for Earth's environment. Taking the attitude that you can trash any place you go without regard for consequences, of which you are mostly unaware, is what is being criticized here. If someone is willing to dump garbage on the moon because they don't care about trashing the moon, why would they care about doing the same thing on Earth?</text>

    <text>Because Earth has varied and multiple delicate ecosystems. Mars does not. It's like asking "why can I play football on a field, but not in my house?"</text>

    <text>How do you know Mars doesn't have systems that would be disrupted by pollution? Or that pollution wouldn't inhibit development of Mars?</text>

    <text>Everything I've read so far about Mars indicates that if anything, pollution might make it *more* habitable because of how thin its atmosphere is, the things killing Earth are precisely what Mars could use more of. However, if you're aware of contradicting material I'm open to it.</text>

    <text>Any human colony would need water. If we are dumping trash and chemical waste everywhere, that would impact the quality of local water sources which don't have any biological filtration systems like Earth's wetlands. What is the point of treating Mars like Earth if we will just end up with the same problems pollution has caused for human on Earth?</text>
