    <title>CMV: It makes sense that police would be more violent on average than other people because the job naturally appeals to control freaks.</title>

    <original_post>(Disclaimer:This isn't an ACAB post. I think many cops are good people doing a job that society needs, and I'm not here to say that every cop is bad  or violent or that we should abolish police.)

A study in the 90s found that about 40% of cops were reported for domestic violence as opposed to 10% of the general population. I know that study is outdated, and may not be entirely accurate, but it makes sense that cops would be more violent on average than regular people because the job naturally appeals to control freaks.

The job largely entails enforcing rules, giving people orders that they have to obey, and physically coercing them if they don't comply. Even if the cop's order is unlawful, you're generally advised to obey anyway and take it to court later. If someone is naturally power-hungry, this is the kind of job that would appeal to them.

Again, I'm not saying every cop is bad or violent. I think their job is necessary and I think a lot of cops are good people, but the job itself  attracts control freaks.</original_post>

    <text>I don't think it's so much the input into the police force so much as it is what the job inputs back into the police.  Think about the level of vigilance and suspicion required of a police officer, especially one whose beat is a frequently dangerous neighborhood.  Human beings are not good at staying mentally on guard that often, especially when most of the time nothing is happening -- except when it is emphatically not.

Spend thirty years having to be paranoid in your daily life and I think a large percentage of people would start to crack and lose the ability to turn that side of themselves off at home.  That level of maintained stress and tension will have serious negative effects on someone's ability to be calm, and it won't be easy to turn that off like a switch when their shift is over.</text>

    <text>I think that's a contributing factor, but different jobs attract different types of people. It could be some level of both.</text>

    <text>Sure, but I don't think we can take OP's view as a given when there's an environmental factor as significant at this that could be at play.</text>

    <text>It’s completely anecdotal but I have a good example of This. I have a relative who is a south-side Chicago cop. He’s been on the force for about 30 years. He’s seen everything, roadkill victims, murders, bodies, robberies,  etc. I went on vacation with him and it was amazing how paranoid he was about everything. He lost his keys 3 times and every time he freaked out because he thought that they were stolen. One time a man was walking towards the road and he thought the man was going to get hit. There was one time we were at a gas station and he flinched when someone reached into their pocket. He was extremely paranoid.</text>
