    <title>CMV: it is a jerk move to play music while camping within earshot of other campers.</title>
    <original_poster>estheredna</original_poster>
    <original_post>We put a tent up in a state park campground for about 4 weeks out of the summer. Most of the time you can just hear nature, people talking, kids playing, lots of birds and squirrels  . Every 5th day or so, there is someone who brings some Bluetooth speakers so they can listen to music , but loud  enough  that people in a half dozen sites nearby get to ‘enjoy’ whatever they are playing. 

Right now I’m cooking dinner and the guys next to me are playing U2, Dave Matthew Band and similar inoffensive crap.

This would be entirely normal in a backyard gathering, but once you reserve to be in a public campground, it becomes selfish, intrusive,  rude.

Am I wrong?

(I know it’s a known risk of car camping. I’m not really  mad. More rolling my eyes. I wish they’d shut that crap off.  )

    <text>If it's at a reasonable volume and isn't anything extreme in terms of genre or expletives, played during reasonable hours then I think it's acceptable. Sure the term reasonable is subjective but use your words man. Just ask them if they would turn it down a little.

I like to play music when I'm chilling at the camp site but when I turn it on I will usually do a lap of my immediate neighbours and ask them if the volume is ok and let them know that if it's bothering them I'm happy to turn it off.</text>
