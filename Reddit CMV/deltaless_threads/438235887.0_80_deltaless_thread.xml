    <title>CMV: If gender is a social construct, then so is race</title>
    <original_poster>BoppeBoye</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let us take, as a given, that gender is divorced from the circumstances of your birth, that it is not a mental illness, and that there is no biological basis for what gender identity someone should express. Have I phrased that effectively? I'm trying to be concise, but I want to portray that premise correctly.

Why, then, should race be different than gender? If race carries with it "shared experience" and "lived experience", etc - that assumes that the only way you could understand what it's like to be a minority is to have lived your entire life as that particular minority. I'm not arguing against that, I agree that there are certain experiences that I could not comprehend - for instance, overbearing &amp;amp; strict Asian parents with exceedingly high expectations. 

But, if someone can change their gender or decide (?) that they identify as a different gender without having the prior lived experience of said gender, then why can't someone identify as a different race?

I'm not able to encompass all the variables which could lead someone to identify as another gender, but is it not possible for someone to come to the same conclusion with their race? What if an Indian man grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood, saw or experienced the same (or similar) discrimination as them, had minimal exposure to Indian culture; and this led him to conclude that he identifies more closely as a black man, rather than Indian? 

I would also like to cite Rachel Dolezal, who was uniformly mocked for being (afaik) the first trans-black woman in the public eye. It seems similar to transgender discrimination to me, assuming that there is something wrong with her mentally for deciding to become a black woman... Anyway, I'm not really defending her because that's not really in line with what I described in the previous paragraph (she grew up privileged IIRC), but the public reaction of mockery goes against the leftist belief of acceptance, by my perspective.

So, in short, why can there be no such thing as trans-racial people, the same way there are transgender?

    <text>This is slightly annoying due to complexity of the issue. If we're talking about biology and studies that show women develop breast cancer at high rates, men develop prostrate cancer at higher rates, and black individuals develop sickle cell anemia and higher rates then no none of these are social constructs. They exist inherently. 

The same can be attributed to the fact that more men are diagnosed with autism. Also autism tends to correlate with higher functioning parts of the brain which are used in computer science. Therefore one could deduct a significant connection on why there are more men who work in computer science. 

Now as for choosing gender, orientation, lifestyle etc. those are all personal preferences that surely can be respected even if one disagrees, however if you start trying to impede upon scientific studies with gender neutral pronouns like zi, for an academic article- that immediately begins to lose relevant information. And to force other to refer to someone that's not based in a high scientific or social construct is absurd. A list would be nearly impossible to remember and forever changing.  

It's sufficient to simply accept that there is a spectrum of genders, orientations, lifestyles, etc. but for the basis of science and progress it seems only logical to leave sex and color as inherent studies patterns  grouped in nature. And the two shouldn't be confused or intermixed because constructs change socially whereas sex and color change only through reproduction or evolution. </text>
