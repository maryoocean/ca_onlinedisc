    <title>Cmv: Companies should not volantarily raise wages</title>
    <original_poster>omar1759</original_poster>
    <original_post>A company (specifically one that has many investors such as publicly traded companies, but also private ones) that is already able to recruit AND KEEP more than enough quality workers at a given wage should never decide to volantarily(meaning without being forced by market conditions that cause labor prices to go up naturally) raise wages solely on the basis of helping workers. This is because generally speaking a company's moral duty should be to maximize profit for it's shareholders and basically labor is an expense just like utilities and companies are supposed to minimize expenses to achieve this duty. 
This btw does not include small businesses where the only investor is the one owner of the business rather than a group of investors. 
In that case the owner would be free to raise wages as he wishes however unintelligent that may be. I still it is not a smart decision to raise wages significantly above the market rate in this situation if you are looking at the overall good. A small business with more profits can expand the business and hire more workers.
However in this post I am still trying to focus on businesses with many investors and how it is morally unacceptable for the board of directors or CEOs to decide to raise wages more than necessary to hire enough quality workers.

Edit: I just want to emphasize I'm talking about raisiwages when the current wages already help recruit more than enough high quality workers, because people are responding saying that paying workers enough helps them be more productive.. I already took that into account.. If you need 50 high quality workers and you can get them at $12 you should not raise wages to $15 if it won't make much of a difference in quality and if your only objective is to help workers financially or "provide a living wage"</original_post>

    <text>So the obvious question here is, what makes maximizing profit for shareholders a moral duty as opposed to just a goal they've set for themselves because it's in their interest to do so?</text>

    <text>Because investors hire the board of directors and ceo and economically speaking it's beneficial in providing incentives to invest in these businesses if the return is satisfactory which helps provide more goods and services(thus lowering prices) in the long run</text>

    <text>But that doesn't answer why it's a moral duty as opposed to just good business sense.

I think we as a society have internalized what's essentially a PR talking point that a business pursuing its self-interest is some kind of moral duty that we need to respect instead of just self-interest for self-interest's sake. In any other context, we don't buy that same argument. If I as an individual claim that I have a moral duty to act in my self-interest, people would reject that claim and hold me responsible for how I treat others.</text>

What? No! You should act in self interest</text>

    <text>Whether I should because it benefits me and whether I have a moral duty to do so are two different things.

You're free to assign yourself whatever purpose you want, but others aren't obligated to recognize and respect it, much less enshrine it as a moral duty. Businesses assign themselves the goal of generating profit because it benefits them to do so. The idea that this goal is a moral duty is an idea they invented because, once again, it benefits them to do so.</text>
