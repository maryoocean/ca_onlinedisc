    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>I’m not religious but the existence of religion in the world doesn’t make me uncomfortable. If it makes you uncomfortable, that’s a you problem. 

Allowing people personal religious expression in a public space does not mean the public institution is supporting any particular religion. 

There should probably be rules to minimize open discussion of my religion vs your religion (which could lead to fights) in schools but otherwise, let the Jews wear their caps, you noxious little tyrant.</text>
