    <title>CMV: Twitter will be transformed into a right-wing hellscape</title>
    <original_poster>newleafsauce</original_poster>
    <original_post>I fear Twitter will become yet another fringe, conspiracy-fuelled and bigoted platform like all the sites that don't moderate for misinformation or hate speech. User enjoyability will plummet and the loudest and most active sect will be those who ordinarily would be banned under the pre-Musk terms &amp;amp; conditions. 

Musk has expressed his intentions today to transform Twitter into a site that allows all free speech under the law. What does this mean? This means white supremacists, incels, misogynists, conspiracy theorists, science denialists, and anti-LGBT zealots, among other far-right groups will be able to promote the most repugnant content and disinformation, and grow their respective movements, which will inevitably spill over into the real world. They will be allowed to brigade and hate on any Twitter user who belongs to the identities they despise. And their victims can't do anything meaningful about it except to spend hours blocking harrasing accounts / DMs or to leave the platform entirely.  

The toxicity will get so bad that the  most socially-progressive people and people with non-fringe views will likely leave. Twitter will skew heavily right-wing and far-right fast under Musk. 

If you can say anything to alleviate my fears and predictions, I would be open to hearing it so I can have my mind changed on this.</original_post>

    <text>Freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom to harass. Twitter isn't going to get rid of all moderation. I also doubt they will let them freely spread hate speech on their website.

Musk is a businessman. He isn't going to spend 46 billion on Twitter just to destroy it. This isn't some ego thing, he sees value in owning Twitter and doesn't want to see it fall to competition.</text>

    <text>But Musk tweeted today his intentions of making Twitter a place where "all free speech under the law" is tolerated. So that means tolerating hate speech. And by harassment, I don't mean illegal harassment but just the brigading type of harassment or innundation of comments flooding someone's posts.</text>
