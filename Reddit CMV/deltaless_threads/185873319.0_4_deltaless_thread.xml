    <title>CMV: Google Chrome is better than Mozilla Firefox</title>
    <original_poster>zer0t3ch</original_poster>
    <original_post>First of all, this is an all-encompassing opinion, not a statement of fact. I am in no way saying that Chrome is technologically superior or anything of that nature, it's just.... well..... *better*.

# My reasons

* **Chrome is more secure**
 * as far as I can tell, this is basically undeniable fact. Tab sandboxing being the most obvious feature, but there also hasn't been an vital exploit (that I'm aware of) in years
* **Better technology support**
 * I haven't checked in a while, but Chrome always seems the fastest to adopt new technologies, which is great as both a consumer and a developer
* **Ease-of-use**
 * As an end-user, this one is key. I install Chrome, I'm good to go. Get an Android phone with Chrome; Log in on both, now everything is synced. Want to see currently opened tabs? Great. It's just so simple and streamlined. (Coincidentally I'm a Linux user who hates Apple for the exact reason of making things "just work")
* **Chrome Apps/Extensions**
 * From what I can tell, Chrome has a lot more people developing for it's web store, while Firefox's add-ons site is dated and minimally supported. Also, from what I understand, Firefox completely lacks any "Apps" and while I understand why not everyone can agree that this is an inherent con, I regularly use apps such as SSH, VNC, Google Play Music (for the mini player), and Hangouts.
* **Development**
 * I know FF has a lot of developer tools, as does Chrome. I honestly haven't used FF for development in years, so I have no basis as to which is better.

    <text>Firstly, I think you can't really compare them globally, as both have some big advantages, but also serious disadvantages. That's as comparing Linux, Win and OSX. Each one is made differently, for something different, and has some cons/pros. You just have to choose the one that suits you more.

Concerning your points:  
1) I'm not a hardcore programmer, so I don't know how's the code, but I would personally trust more Mozilla then Google about handling my data.  
2) Sometimes true, but when something crucial is missing from Firefox, they'll probably add it. Chrome doesn't really care about user suggestions. If they dn't want to add something, you won't ever get it.  
3) Sync is also in FF. Don't know if it's as easy as in Chrome though.
4) You can't customize Chrome as much as Firefox. Don't know about apps, but in my opinion, 99% of Chrome apps are useless, or just redirects for websites.  
5) The same, Firefox has even a Developer Edition (haven't tried it yet though). Also, it's open source, Chrome is not.

I'm using both browsers, Chrome is faster/cleaner, but has many disadvantages for me, which haven't been addressed by its developers for years.</text>

    <text>Yes, but since Chrome is proprietary they could have added lots of nasty stuff in there. You can't say that Chrome is open source just because it's based on something that is.</text>

    <text>Fair enough. I can understand the security concern with that.</text>

    <text>That'd be like saying OSX is Open Source because Darwin is.</text>
