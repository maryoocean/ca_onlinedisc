    <title>CMV: I believe that abortion as a result of consensual sex (without contraception) is wrong.</title>
    <original_poster>BreakinMyBallz</original_poster>
    <original_post>I feel as though women who choose to have sex without the means of contraception, simply don't care if they get pregnant. They put their pleasures over the risk of having a child and having it terminated. 

I feel as though, when the sperm and egg mix, they create a completely new set of DNA, DNA that has never been the same in the entire history of our species and is a completely unique person (I'm not Theist, I try to base my arguments on the uniqueness of each person)

I don't see any way for someone to justify abortion when it is the result of sex without contraception. That woman simply did not care that new life was created within her, and chose to have sex in the first place. We argue it's a woman's choice for abortion? No, It's a woman's choice to have sex without the means of contraception.

-------
Clarification - I believe contraception is OK because new life with unique DNA and a unique person has not been formed and therefore will not be removed from the world.</original_post>

Why stop there? Why not kill off an identical twin, because only one unique set of DNA has value, and another is just superfluous? </text>

    <text>Did I say that only one set of DNA has value? They both have unique genes.</text>

    <text>no one of them isn't unique. One of them is a repeat of the other.</text>

    <text>Actually in twins the zygote splits and forms two embryos, neither one came from the other.</text>

    <text>I'm aware, but they don't have 'unique' DNA. they are two people with the same DNA. They are not unique DNA-wise. </text>

    <text>Yes, but those differences are so minute we've only recently had ways of testing for them. 

Our genetics change due to environmental factors both in utero and as we age: they are not fixed. To hold a clump of unique cells as valuable due to it's genetic make-up, when those genetics are subject to change, seems to place an over-importance on genetic diversity at an arbitrary point in the process.</text>
