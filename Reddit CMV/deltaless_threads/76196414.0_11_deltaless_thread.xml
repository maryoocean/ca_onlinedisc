    <original_post>Every now and then, I see the odd post, "If the top 1% gave up their profits, we could cure world hunger" or something ridiculous like that. I dont know why people that have less expect people that have more to help them. Why should they? 

Edit: better example. 

Edit: my C got Ved, /u/amemut explained it in a very pragmatic manner that I could agree with. </original_post>

    <text>Although agree that the poor shouldn't be helped, I don't think the rich should have as much as they do. It's unnecessary to have way more than you need, and that money could be put to better use by helping the general public. </text>
