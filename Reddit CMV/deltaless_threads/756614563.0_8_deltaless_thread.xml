    <title>CMV: It should be illegal to have a pitbull that isn't spayed or neutered</title>

    <original_post>Should be self-explanatory. I don't think we should straight up ban the breed, but getting such a dog fixed should be a legal requirement for owning one. Un-neutered dogs are \[responsible for the vast majority of serious attacks\]([https://www.avma.org/Advocacy/StateAndLocal/Pages/dogbite-summary.aspx](https://www.avma.org/Advocacy/StateAndLocal/Pages/dogbite-summary.aspx)) according to the AVMA. This would also result in a pit bull population decline which would reduce the huge number of pits clogging up shelters.</original_post>

    <text>You are wrong, because pitbulls are a fantastic breed of dog with many admirable qualities that make them ideal companions.

Pitbulls were originally bred for fighting, so yes, they do have a high-prey drive, but in the past "manbiters" were routinely culled, thus making properly bred and socialized pitbulls far less human agressive than the average pooch.

They suffer from popularity and an image that causes a certain element to improperly breed and raise them.</text>
