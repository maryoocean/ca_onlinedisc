    <title>CMV: Where your born doesn't matter and country pride is pointless</title>
    <original_poster>Blank-VII</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't think I belong to a country and I think the concept is odd. I was born in the UK and have lived here all my life, but I fail to understand why people are so hard-core about being a 'proud brit' or anything. Where I was born isn't something I was able to decide for myself, and I want my life to be what I make out of it, not what it decides for me. I believe the only way to belong to a country is to find one whose culture is similar to your own tastes and opinions, and to move there. What's the point in being proud of a country I was born in if I feel no attachment to how it's run or anything else?

*you're

*View partially changed. Country pride is not pointless.

**Main view unchanged, it seems no-one can quite convince me. I've had some fantastic conversations and I'm really happy with how many of you engaged without being toxic. Stay safe y'all. Thanks so much!**</original_post>

    <text>Being born in and living in the UK means that you would have had a different life growing up than in any other country. your speech, taste in food and  general world view will be affected by the country that you grew up in (legally the country you where born in dose matter). So your country directly reflects on you.</text>

    <text>Absolutely. I agree with nurture as a concept, and I agree that being born in Britain has shaped me into who I am today. As an adult with beliefs I've formed now though, I don't believe Britain is doing everything right, and as a whole I don't believe *in Britain*. Why should I call myself British then? I'm a citizen, sure, but I'm not British in the same way everyone else celebrates. I don't enjoy a lot of typical British stuff, and don't tend to align myself with it's people or the countries views.</text>

    <text>I'm from the UK as well and i think being British is more to do with your differences than your similarity's. There is no set standard for what a Brit is and inst and i'm sure if you asked 100 British people there would be 100 different answers (even if only slightly different).

So what i'm basically saying is that being British only mean what you want it to mean.</text>

I really like this, it's a fantastic point. Being any culture is whatever the hell you want it to be in some respects, for sure. But then why settle on the one I'm stuck with just because I'm born here?

&amp;gt;So what i'm basically saying is that being British only mean what you want it to mean.

I partially agree with you. But you could honestly say that about anything, any country or culture or nationality or *anything*. I'm also a biker, gamer etc. and I'm actively proud of those things and the labels due to the fact I **chose** them for myself. I wasn't born a biker or gamer, they define me as a person because I want them to.</text>

    <text>You seem to be labouring under this misapprehension that labels only relate to things that we've chosen about ourselves, You can't choose your sex, height, eye colour, the town or city you grew up in or a million other different things but it wouldn't make any sense to say that people shouldn't use them to describe you.</text>

    <text>I think the OP would argue that sex, height, eye color, and hometown are all things you should not be proud of, because they are not your own accomplishments.</text>

    <text>But there is a difference between saying that you shouldn't feel proud of a particular label and saying that those labels don't have any descriptive value.</text>

    <text>Another problem with this debate is the concept of pride vs shame. A lot of the time, when the word "pride" is used, it means  "don't have shame", especially for "assigned" characteristics. So for example, should you proud to be short? Well, you sure as hell shouldn't feel shame for being short, so "pride" is how we counter social marginalization that comes from being short or being discriminated against things we did not choose.</text>

    <text>One could feel neither pride nor shame. Just neutral.</text>

    <text>Ideally, yes. I have neither pride nor shame for wearing a blue shirt or for wearing glasses, for example. 

BUT discrimination does lead to shame for many things... like skin color, being short, or national origin. Pride is how we've come to fight back against the shame</text>

    <text>This could be said about literally everywhere. This is actually exactly a reason to recognize that patriotism is bullshit.</text>
