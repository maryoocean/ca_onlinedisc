    <title>CMV:Segregated ( by gender) workplaces would lead to improved productivity.</title>
    <original_poster>hastyanon</original_poster>
    <original_post>I created this throwaway as I know this is a controversial and sexist opinion but it is one I have built up after 15 years of working in various environments. I would love someone to show me how I am wrong on this (preferably with some research to back it up) but in my experience, male-only (or almost male-only) work environments have been more on-task, have fewer issues of bitchyness and non-work related office disagreements, and generally more professionalism. I have worked in software development where teams/departments have frequently been 99% men and also worked in other office environments with a more equal mix. I see office politics in both situations but in offices with a greater number of women I have noticed a significantly greater quantity of personal issues becoming involved (relationships/friendships/personal disagreements etc). These frequently affect staff turnover and productivity. I can't comment on female-only environments as I have never worked in one, but would love to hear from those that have. I don't think women are any different to men in terms of productivity but from what I have seen the combination of men and women at work in an office is less than ideal. I'm looking forward to hearing your arguments and opinions. Please help me to change my view!

    <text>I think you might be confusing cause and effect.  

This is a sexist society, and men and women behave unecessarily differently.  
In companies where the job is political, lots of PR and perception is important, women tend to do better, whereas in environments where you have to get down to business maybe they are not so attracted or the industry filters them out previously (for example an IT office where few females study IT in the first place).  

This means that separating men and women wouldn't change the reality of the job, on the contrary the mixed interaction is a way of not letting this go to extremes.  

The way to work around this is for society to be less and less exist, so men and women can move around roles freely, specially as kids, so when they grow up you are not conditioned to one or the other.  </text>
