    <title>CMV: the way that conservatives have got in line behind Trump shows that they never really believed in anything in the first place, apart from belonging to a tribe and beating the other tribe.</title>

    <original_post>As things stand, Trump has already been chosen as a presidential candidate once and is massively in the lead to be chosen again. Yet he seems to go against traditional conservative values in so many respects. 

* Family values: he's a known adulterer, "grab 'em by the pussy" etc.
* Religion: clownishly ignorant about the Bible
* Managerial competence: ignorant of basic facts about world and US affairs
* Honest dealing: on his own admission he's exploited bankruptcy rules several times to get out of debts. And where are the tax returns?
* Promises kept: where's the money from Mexico for the wall? Where's the "beautiful" healthcare plan that we were promised?
* Decorum: I don't think I need to say much about this one. Belittling, name-calling, tantrums, the list goes on.
* Democracy: "if I lose then it was rigged". This is probably the biggest of them all. 

I understand that some conservatives have distanced themselves. But the majority of the GOP seems to be behind him. What explains this, except for wanting to feel like you're in the in-group, and wanting to own the stupid libs?</original_post>

    <text>I'm from Europe, here it's normal that voters support the same political leader through many elections, who is in and out of power on and off. (For example Poland's next PM is coming back after two electoral cycles.) It's a very American phenomenon that a losing president basically goes into internal exile, not to be heard from ever again. Trump is breaking that unspoken rule, allowing Republican voters to act more like those in Europe: if they feel the president's job was left unfinished or the country took the wrong turn after he left, they stick with him, aiming to put him back into office at the next available opportunity. They're gonna vote for Trump's MAGAism until they feel all its objectives were met, they're not gonna pretend Trump does not exist anymore because he lost one election.</text>
