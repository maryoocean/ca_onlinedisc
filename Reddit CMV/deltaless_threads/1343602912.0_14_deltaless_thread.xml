    <title>CMV: The recent Atlantic shootings was not an anti-Asian event.</title>
    <original_poster>MacV_writes</original_poster>
    <original_post>A white man shot six Asian women along with two others in Atlanta. The narrative that has been that this is directly caused by anti-Asian sentiment driven by racist white supremacists stoking bigotry against Asians. To solve this problem, America must truly commit to not being racist, to listen to those in the Asian community, and to teach young white men in particular the privilege they have as well as the deadly effects of toxic masculinity. 

However, there are details that do not fit the narrative. 

A. The shooter said that this was not racially motivated. 

B. The shooter killed a white woman and white man. 

C. While the shooter had shared a post critical of China https://twitter.com/yellokeith/status/1372202427584192513?s=09 it never rose beyond the national condemnation -- and the victims were Korean.

D. White nationalists in particular are well known for their love of Asian peoples and Asian culture, due to their valuation of ethnostates. 

E. Intentionally racist shootings usually come with racist manifestos, shamelessly racist worldviews, racist narratives about how white people are facing oppression. 

F. The #1 systemic discrimination Asian people face is from Progressives championing 'meritocracy is racist' and 'Asians are white-adjacent' inflammatory racial rhetoric, resulting in concrete discriminatory politics targeting Asian people specifically by their race. https://www.newsweek.com/asian-americans-emerging-strong-voice-against-critical-race-theory-opinion-1574503 

G. Criticism of China as a global, hegemonic, communist power is mainstream and not founded on race or xenophobia. 

It is my view Progressivism is a system which converts Trauma into capital. It seems as though these current narratives are forcing an anti-Asian narrative as a politically motivated strategy to appeal to build on this system. People like Trevor Noah believe killing six Asian people necessarily is a racist attack. But that strikes me as intentionally crude analysis. Isn't it racist for us to project all Asians onto China? Aren't we racistly manipulating the narrative when we selectively emphasize race to push politics, especially when said politics advocates for formally discriminating against Asians as "white-adjacent?"</original_post>

    <text>I'm not sure! How did so many Asians end up in higher education that Progressives advocate formal discriminatory policy based on race?</text>

    <text>Dude that’s some raging deflection that shows you have no interest in actually considering any other perspective.  Why not just consider the question instead of deflecting to your misinterpretation of a whole separate political issue.</text>

    <text>Raging deflection? As in, Asians should _absolutely rage against the formal discriminatory race based measures instituted against them?_ Everyone acknowledges Asian women are attractive. Lol. Also, Asian people excel in the US. To the point where they're systemically _handicapped._ By _your_ literally racist! politics.</text>

    <text>You have to describe the incoherency. I described yours, by showing you how your symmetrical treatment of sex as though it were race is incoherence. The dynamics of the racist is different than that of the sexist.</text>

    <text>Incoherent: expressed in an incomprehensible or confusing way; unclear.

I called your response a raging deflection. You incomprehensibly tried to state that Asians should rage instead of addressing my comment.

I asked why you couldn’t address their question.  You incomprehensibly stated everyone thinks Asians are attraction and that they excel.

Then you called me racist without even knowing what policies I support.

Honestly you seem high or something.  Your comments this morning do not make sense and I’m done engaging.</text>

    <text>There's also a formal incoherence, which ironically, you've deflected from addressing. It seems novelty is bewildering to you. 

Of course you are a racist. Not only are you eager to project racist intent, you don't care that the politics you support formally discriminates against Asians: https://www.newsweek.com/asian-americans-emerging-strong-voice-against-critical-race-theory-opinion-1574503 you'd rather act bewildered than engage the actual system of racism that Asians face -- which is equity based Progressivism.</text>
