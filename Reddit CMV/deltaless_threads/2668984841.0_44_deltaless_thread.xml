    <title>CMV: women are not going for the 'upper tier' of men</title>
    <original_poster>BadgerSame6600</original_poster>
    <original_post>I see this rhetoric over and over and over online, and hear it IRL sometimes.  It drives me crazy tbh. I am a man out in the world, living life, 35 years of it now. I have friends who are all over the spectrum of physical attractiveness. Some are single, most aren't. Their gfs/wifes are also across the spectrum. In most couples I know, friends and acquaintances,  the woman is better looking, earns more, or has more social skills ect. 

Now I know this is my experience, so it is anecdotal, but at the same time I just don't buy this whole women are too choosy. My opinion is that the dudes who say this are refusing to address their flaws and accept them. If these men believe this and they go out into the world feeling hard done by, fighting a losing battle, then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Most people can smell that level of victimhood a mile of. 

OK, open to have this challenge, so- change my view, Redditors! </original_post>

    <text>Nah I agree with this entirely and have been saying it forever.  Most millennial women (I’m 34, male) are absolutely dominating compared to us dudes.  The number of couples I know where the woman out earns the man, solidly above 50% in 2023 at least among my social group.  In our mid 30s most of my male friends don’t take care of themselves, look like shit (fat, bald, not fit, sloppy, etc).  Yet almost all of my friends have wives or girlfriends, a solid 95% of which are better looking than they are.  

My few perpetually single but not for a lack of trying friends are the small handful of guys who refuse to address/fix ANYTHING about themselves and seemingly have zero self awareness when it comes to looks.</text>
