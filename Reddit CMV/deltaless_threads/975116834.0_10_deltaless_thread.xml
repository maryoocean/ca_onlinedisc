    <title>CMV: Racism towards white people exists</title>
    <original_poster>OnlyNineteenLetters</original_poster>
    <original_post>Racism by definition is prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.

People throw around that racism is based off power+prejudice but that is incorrect according to the definition. They seem to think that because white people are 'dominant' in society that you can't be racist to them because of their position, but that is not true. People who say reverse racism does not exist are right, because it is normal racism. Racism is based purely off that: Race. Not power or position in society. 

The power+prejudice argument was invented so that certain parties could espouse racist views without the negative stigma of the term.</original_post>

    <text>I think a better explanation for negative opinions of "white people" would be resentment not racism.</text>

    <text>Why would someone who holds an opinion like "white people are the scum of the earth and should be exterminated" be better described as resentment instead of racism?</text>

    <text>It doesnt matter why. they hate a specific group of people regardless of their individuality, but solely because of their racial group affiliation. That's racist.</text>
