    <title>CMV: voting for the president is pointless</title>
    <original_poster>TheRealPifftastic</original_poster>
    <original_post>The reason I feel this way is because of the electoral college.  The popular vote hasn't been used to elect a president since sometime in the 1800's. Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 2.8 million in 2016.All of the "get out and vote" sentiments are such a waste of time,money, and effort.  I do vote in local/state issues and politicians, because that really is the power of the people in action. All of my friends think I'm missing the point, and I may be. I really feel that out political system is deeply flawed. From all the special interests groups and lobbyists to tax breaks for multi million dollar companies that don't pay American taxes or pay a livable wage to the workers. I feel that nothing can change until the power of the people rule the country and not 538 voters that are easily swayed by greed.</original_post>

    <text>I live in a country where you vote for the MP from your constituency &amp;amp; the PM candidate who's party/coalition gets the most MPs in parliament wins. But I believe that underlying "rule" doesn't change.

As an individual your vote might not change the outcome of the overall election &amp;amp; it's probably unlikely to change it in the local level. But there's a "critical level" where enough people can share your opinion and decide not to vote which would play a role in deciding the outcome. 
If I remember correctly, gerrymandering too plays a role in the "ineffectiveness".</text>
