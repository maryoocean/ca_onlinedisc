    <title>CMV: Fredom of speech is far more important than a few people being offended</title>

    <original_post>Freedom of speech should be protected and kept, there shouldn't be people arrested for anti trans comments or insulting a soldier/soldiers, or for nazi jokes, or racist remarks or jokes.

Those should all be handled between people, if someone says stuff you dont like you handle it, simply block them or avoid them, theres a whole world you can be in and that persons in a very tiny part of it. 

It makes me nervous seeing people arrested and charged for saying things. It's only leading us to a place where we can be arrested for saying whatever the government doesnt like. And they shouldn't be in that much power to effect our communication with eachother. 

I live in scotland and dont feel I have freedom of speech anymore. 

(For the record I'm a white woman who's bi and have trans thoughts ig for those folks who say it never has been about me, it has sometimes, and in more ways than just those)

Edit: No it's not just anti trans people, Yes I believe crimes other than hate crimes involving speech should be illegal (threatening violence, doxing, defamation) but I also believe insults, jokes and bad takes or thoughts should not be.

Edit 2: Consequences for what is said like losing a job, getting insulted, losing friends ect is totally fine I just dont think the Government should be in charge of what can get you arrested in this sence.

Edit 3: I live in SCOTLAND in the UNITED KINGDOM or in BRITAIN depending what you say, I'm not american, im also not here advocating for my right to be a dick, im just saying the government arent the ones I want saying what I cant say, I mean twitter can destroy lives without them anyway.</original_post>

    <text>As someone who's gone through bullying this argument makes my blood boil.

A kid bullies another kid every day for years. There's no violence, just words. Words that get progressively more and more extreme, to the point of jokingly threatening. Teachers will tell you to just ignore it. Just ignore it and they will stop they say.

The reality is it doesn't stop them. They keep doing it because BECAUSE they are bored. 

If it gets bad enough your parents and teachers might be able to do something about it but if not, it's very difficult to do anything about it.

This situation applies in real life outside school too.

We live in a society that only functions because of a fragile balance we've managed to create thanks to laws and regulations. Laws that limit freedom of speech among other things are designed to stop cases like I described because in real life your parents can't come and save you.</text>
