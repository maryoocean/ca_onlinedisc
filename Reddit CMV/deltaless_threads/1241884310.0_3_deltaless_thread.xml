    <title>CMV: if you live in a “traditionally Christian” nation you should use Merry Christmas as the default greeting/goodbye unless you’re asked not to.</title>
    <original_poster>physioworld</original_poster>
    <original_post>Basically I think of it similar to misgendering people. In that context use the pronouns of the gender they appear to present as (unless you already know the person’s wishes). If and when someone asks you to use an alternate set, you apologise and change going forward. 

The same should be done with Christmas- in my experience almost nobody has any genuine objection to being told merry Christmas, hell, I was discussing just today with a woman in a full hijab our favourite (largely secular) aspects of Christmas, all the while referring to things as “Christmas XYZ”. However if someone tells me they’d prefer happy holidays then I’ll just switch. Just like pronouns it literally makes no difference to me. 

You can change my view by showing me that knowingly using words that will make someone else feel less welcome or upset is not worth it compared to the potential loss I might feel at using a different term. Of course maybe you can come up with other arguments I’ve not thought of.

Edit: this only applies “at this time of year” say more or less the month of December.</original_post>

    <text>Like, year round?

My actual question would be what potential loss do you feel when using a different term? And do you have a list of "traditionally Christian" nations? The United States of "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion" America couldn't possibly be on that list</text>

    <text>Delta!

It was meant to say this time of year, I’ll edit. But broadly I mean nations which, over the last, say, 3-4 generations, have been majority Christian in the population, I was never really referring to the politics but more so the traditions of the people. 

And exactly, for me there is indeed very little loss, but if someone can explain what such a loss might be for them, maybe I could understand.</text>
