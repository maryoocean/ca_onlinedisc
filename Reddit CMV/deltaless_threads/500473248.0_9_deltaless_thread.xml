    <title>CMV: There is no such thing as "love at first sight"</title>

    <original_post>So-called love at first sight is based on just that - sight. 
&amp;amp;nbsp;

Now I know some people are going to jump in with anecdotes about grandparents who married after three dates and were together for 70 years and whatnot. But that is a form of commitment and usually (in older people) a response to a society that did not really allow for divorce. Can two people make it work if they fall in love based on sight and quickly marry? Sure, sometimes. But that doesn't mean that real love, deep love like you have when you know all parts of a person can form immediately upon seeing them. You can't truly love someone without knowing about their personality, their thoughts and their feelings.</original_post>

    <text>I would say that society's definition of love is quite difficult. If we define love as an emotion and a feeling of connection, a sense of a bond of two people than that means that it exists in the moment only, since it is an emotion and thus temporary.

If we see and meet someone for the first time, I would say that for that moment, it is possible to feel a sense of deep connection whatever it is rooted in. How the feeling then progresses, will depend however, if you only define love as a sensation of a deep connection that must not continue over a longer period of time, I think it is possible to say that love at first sight is possible, since it is possible to make this kind of deep connection in the first moments of meeting someone.</text>
