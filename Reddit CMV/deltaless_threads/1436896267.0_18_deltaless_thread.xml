    <title>CMV: There are no good or bad music genres, just good or bad artists.</title>

    <original_post>I get it. Rock is your favorite music genre, you hate country or pop. Whatever it is, it doesn’t make your favorite genre “the one”.

Music is like food. There’s pizza, hamburguers, sandwiches, tacos, burritos, nuggets, etc. That doesn’t make one better than the other. But there are people or restaurants that can make great delicious pizzas and others who make average pizzas. The same way, there are amazing rappers with great lyricism and rhythm, and others who use an overproduced beat and have poor lyricism. There are Metal guitarists with great technique and years of experience, and others who don’t.

And this whole “my favorite genre is better than yours” thing applies to almost everything: books, videogames, movies...</original_post>

    <text>I'm posting because of your comparison to food. In my humble opinion, I say that Vietnamese food is objectively bad. 

And rap is 90% just a bad genre, but not 100% so don't loose your panties rap group.</text>

    <text>Then rap itself isn’t a bad genre. Instead, 90% of rap artists are bad</text>

    <text>Agreed, hence I said I was posting for the food comparison. The rap comment was for kicks and giggles. But I still dont like Vietnamese food. The people are wonderful, the food is awful.</text>
