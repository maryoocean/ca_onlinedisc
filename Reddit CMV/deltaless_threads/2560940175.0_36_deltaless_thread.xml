    <title>cmv: There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as an “American”</title>

    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>The only argument I really have is using the term American to specifically mean the USA can in some contexts make things confusing with north America and South America, people from Mexico or Canada should also be able to say "I'm American" but they can't really do that because the USA decided to name themselves that, only alternative I can think is to just say you're from the US or a US citizen</text>

    <text>I'm what context would someone from Canada or Mexico ever need to refer to themselves as American? I can't think of any examples that wouldn't be already covered by calling themselves "North American"</text>
