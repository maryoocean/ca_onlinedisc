    <title>CMV: All drugs ESPECIALLY opioids and amphetamines should be available for recreational use through legal channels.</title>

    <original_post>My ideal system would be something that included a meeting with a qualified expert in the field providing the user with accurate and appropriate information regarding the substance they are interested in using (much like the medical marijuana system before recreational was approved - except recreational).

This would eliminate the black market and unregulated manufacturing. It would eliminate the cost (societal and monetary) of the drug war. It would eliminate the shame currently involved with those reaching out for help &amp;amp; allow for more responsible decision making. It would also eliminate that primal hunter gatherer itch that gets scratched when you go out and score something you want.  

What do you all think?</original_post>

It would harm it sure, but not at all would it eliminate it.

The war on drugs was never actually a war on drugs, it was another battle in the long war against the poor and minorities. The war will continue on some new front after this.

&amp;gt; It would eliminate the shame currently involved with those reaching out for help &amp;amp; allow for more responsible decision making. 

There are more effective methods to do this.

&amp;gt; It would also eliminate that primal hunter gatherer itch that gets scratched when you go out and score something you want.
