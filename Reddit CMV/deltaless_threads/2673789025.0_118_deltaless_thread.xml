    <title>CMV: The notion that the Democrats or Republicans "must" run Biden or Trump "because there are no other viable candidates" is ridiculous. There are thousands of people who would make better presidential candidates for 2024 than Biden or Trump.</title>

    <original_post>Every argument for Biden or Trump to run in 2024 boils down to some version of "status quo" or "inertia." We're told that the Ds and Rs have no choice but to run these super-old candidates because there's nobody else who could be suitable.

&amp;#x200B;

In a nation of 332,000,000 people, there are well over 100 million who are over the age of 35, American-born, and have resided in the United States for 14 years or more - in other words, are constitutionally eligible to run for president.

Out of those 100 million, surely at least half have a basic education, are mature, sensible, decent people, and have demonstrated solid character - and also be significantly younger than Trump or Biden.

Out of those 50 million, surely at least ten million would qualify as *highly* educated - the metrics of which can be tricky to figure out (is it a master's degree? or something else?) - but they would be significantly above average.

Out of those 10 million, surely at least one million would be quite exceptional - people who have substantially high IQ, have advanced quite far in life and a career - such as being a doctor, or having worked in public governmental service for decades, etc.

And out of those million, surely at least 10,000 would have the political know-how, the charisma, the political interest, maybe have spent significant time abroad in foreign countries or speak multiple languages, to be a suitable president.

In fact, even in Congress, state legislatures or governorships alone, there must be dozens of good, qualified, educated, experienced politicians who would be much younger than Trump or Biden, and who would make suitable presidential candidates. 

So, CMV on this one. I don't buy for one moment the notion that, in a nation of 332 million people, America somehow has no choice but to run Biden vs. Trump in 2024 because "we've got no one else who'd be a good candidate."  </original_post>

    <text>I haven’t heard anyone argue that either party HAS to run Trump or Biden. So like, I don’t know why this is something big enough you made a CMV about?…

The closest thing to someone saying “so-and-so must run cause there are no alternatives” is me saying Trump is the best hope of the GOP not completely dying out because the majority of classic GOP policies are horrible and hardly anyone except boomers actually support them except for the fact that “they aren’t democrats”…? 

Like idk, I guess on a *hypothetical* level I don’t disagree with you, but on a grounded in reality level you’re wrong on the GOP side for my previously mentioned reasons, while on the Dem side you’re wrong because for Democrats it’s ultimately who the party establishment want to run.

I mean, before 2016 I’d have said the same thing about Republicans—which is still true except for someone literally as insane and wealthy and shameless as Trump. 


Run of the mill voters don’t *actually* decide a nominee from millions of potential candidates, the party establishment and donors give us a super tiny slate of up to like 10 pre-approved insiders to pick from, and that’s what we get to pick them from. Like I said, Trump only rode to victory in 2016 because of so many people picking a “f*** you, establishment” candidate in the GOP, and his massive amount of cash. (Say what you want about him and most of it is true, except for the fact that he’s probably the only president in recent memory to have a smaller net-worth after being president, than before…)</text>
