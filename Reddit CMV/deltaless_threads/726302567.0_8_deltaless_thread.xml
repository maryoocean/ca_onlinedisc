    <title>CMV: Children's exposure to religion should be minimised</title>
    <original_poster>yup987</original_poster>
    <original_post>Disclaimer: I'm an atheist and generally anti-religious, so I'm obviously coming from a place of bias here. I will, however, try to make the arguments from the assumption that religion isn't all bad, that reasoned faith (as opposed to blind faith or faith solely based on emotion) in a religion is indeed an ideal. Reasoned faith (as I would define it, feel free to challenge this definition) is faith that is borne out of rational engagement with the dogma and knowledge of a given religion.

This view comes from my personal experience observing the activities of Christian Sunday schools. "Educational activities" usually involve drilling into children messages such as "I love Jesus" and "God is great", and children are encouraged by teachers and peers alike when they demonstrate a greater degree of fervent faith. I am arguing that such practices and other ways that children are exposed to religion, at best, teach children that blindly believing in their religion is an ideal, and at worst akin to brainwashing. Hopefully you fine redditors can broaden my view when it comes to other religions as well that I am less familiar with.

I have heard arguments from parents that their children want to go to church. And why wouldn't they? It'll make their parents happy seeing their child with such unshakeable conviction. Or they'll get to spend time with their friends. Children are not considered in the eyes of most laws globally to be able to give consent (in the broadest sense), or be held accountable and responsible for their actions. This is supported by our understanding of neurological development which tells us that a child's brain is vastly different from adult's. Given all these incentives to go to church unrelated to a commitment to recent faith, why should we bring the child to church, knowing that it will likely only develop their ability to blindly believe?

Thinking from the perspective of psychological development, we know that early childhood experience has a huge impact on behavior later in life. When we expose children to these beliefs with none of the nuance that accompanies (some) religious sermons and text, doesn't it make sense that many of these children will go on to believe that blind faith is the ideal, even if they're told otherwise as adults? We also see lots of children leaving religions as they mature, some comparing their childhood experiences with religion to brainwashing.

My policy proposal here is that children not be allowed to be involved with religion until they reach an age where they can make informed decisions regarding their beliefs (probably a recognised age of adulthood, although something as early as 16 might be safe). Failing that, some form of safeguards to ensure minimal appeals to emotion in any religious teachings directed at children.

I recognise the problem that you can't really insulate children from religion simply because religious parents will (consciously or otherwise) teach their children morals and beliefs linked to their religion. That's inevitable, but if we agree that children will have great difficulty taking up religion through reasoned faith, then the intent of my policy proposal still stands: minimising exposure of children to religion. I view organised religious activity as the best place to target.

In anticipation of those who might say that secularism is a religion too (thanks Naomi!), I acknowledge its history but will nonetheless assume it here to be the "default setting" (especially since many governments are secular) and argue that it occupies a neutral place in society.

Thanks for reading and I sincerely hope you can change my view!</original_post>

    <text>Just as a forward, I wanted to say that throughout this post I will use the term “religion” to reference religion as a whole, however I will mostly be referring to the ideals of Christianity as I am most familiar with its teachings. I will also try my best to argue from a point of view that offers secular benefit.



&amp;gt; This view comes from my personal experience observing the activities of Christian Sunday schools. "Educational activities" usually involve drilling into children messages such as "I love Jesus" and "God is great",

What you seem to be forgetting is that these same classes also teach that “Jesus loves you”, and “with god you are great and anything is possible”. Self worth is pressing issue that will span the entire existence of humankind, and religion is one of the only ways that even those who are completely alone or broken in life can feel that worth and purpose.



&amp;gt; and children are encouraged by teachers and peers alike when they demonstrate a greater degree of fervent faith. I am arguing that such practices and other ways that children are exposed to religion, at best, teach children that blindly believing in their religion is an ideal, and at worst akin to brainwashing. Hopefully you fine redditors can broaden my view when it comes to other religions as well that I am less familiar with.

While I may also be unfamiliar with other religions, what I will say is this, you seem to have a deep aversion to the ideas of faith and belief. Whether this comes from an unfortunate personal experience, or the idea just conflicts with your world view and opinions I ask you to consider this; what is the point of life without faith? Faith does not just have to be in a higher power, but in yourself, truly knowing that you are worth something and that there is some purpose out there for you. While you may have a strong sense of self purpose and confidence, there are many people who don’t, and teaching children to have faith that they are here for a reason and that they matter is one of the biggest benefits of religion. 


&amp;gt; I have heard arguments from parents that their children want to go to church. And why wouldn't they? It'll make their parents happy seeing their child with such unshakeable conviction. Or they'll get to spend time with their friends. 

I would agree with you that children “wanting” to go to church is not a particularly strong argument for why children should experience religion, as a kid for me it was the doughnuts and other sweets offered after the service that kept me interested in attending church. ;)



&amp;gt;Given all these incentives to go to church unrelated to a commitment to recent faith, why should we bring the child to church, knowing that it will likely only develop their ability to blindly believe?

While I fail to understand how the belief in a higher power that loves you and creates you for a purpose is wrong, church and religion in general is not all about a blind belief. It is heavily based in establishing moral obligation to do the right thing. While individuals have been able to spin religious texts to alter what is right, I believe that a belief in god, with discretion towards the priest is the best way to go about building good character in children, and teaching them valuable lessons about life.





&amp;gt; Thinking from the perspective of psychological development, we know that early childhood experience has a huge impact on behavior later in life. 

This is one of the main reasons why I am in favor of the opposite of your argument, teaching children about religion from a young age. The lessons taught by religion are ones of love, acceptance, forgiveness, etc. These are complex topics that are hard enough for adults to understand and practice, making it difficult to instill these essential ideals on the younger generation. Children are very curious, and are always asking why at every command. These questions are very difficult for a lot of parents to answer, unless they can reference religion, as the commandments of an omnipotent, loving god tend to be a lot more convincing than a “because I said so”.
Now I can understand how you might see this as manipulative, and I won’t deny that religion has been, and unfortunately, probably will continue to be used in manipulative ways. But I would argue teaching your children a set of core values is essential to creating functioning members of society, and religion is a very efficient and effective method of accomplishing this. 


&amp;gt;When we expose children to these beliefs with none of the nuance that accompanies (some) religious sermons and text, doesn't it make sense that many of these children will go on to believe that blind faith is the ideal, even if they're told otherwise as adults?

Your argument here relies on the assertion that blind faith is a dangerous thing, and to an extent I would agree. Blind faith in other humans is an awful idea, but following a God, which in everyday life essentially boils down to a core set of values, helps an awful lot when it comes to dealing with pressing moral issues. 


&amp;gt; My policy proposal here is that children not be allowed to be involved with religion until they reach an age where they can make informed decisions regarding their beliefs (probably a recognised age of adulthood, although something as early as 16 might be safe). Failing that, some form of safeguards to ensure minimal appeals to emotion in any religious teachings directed at children.

I hope that I have changed your mind on this policy, as you have said children are very impressionable under your giving age requirement, and it is important to instill in them lifelong ideals that will create “good” people and members of society. The important takeaway is that kids will develop there moral identity around whatever they are subjected to, and almost every religion does a good job at encouraging kindness, generosity and forgiveness, which are all very important traits.

Maybe not the strongest of my arguments to end with, but I wanted to keep my responses to your points in order for the most clarity. I hope I at least convicted you of some of the merits of religion.</text>

    <text>Thanks for the long reply, I'll take on a few of your points I think are the most relevant here.

1. I definitely disagree that religion is the only way, or even the best way, that people can find self-worth and purpose. But I know it definitely helps some people, I'll accept that.

2. I may have some personal issues with faith, but that's actually irrelevant to my argument. I'm not saying that faith is bad, I'm saying that faith without some form of rational engagement is bad because a) if the belief you have faith in is wrong or harmful that you are easily harmed and b) blind faith makes you a puppet, just taking a belief because the imam/rabbi/priest/pastor told you so or because Mum won't love you if you don't.

5. Can we do this without tying these values taught to religious beliefs? See my reply to RampantMonkey. I definitely think we can, and should, if the alternative means that children are taught to blindly follow beliefs. I'd also argue that a moral value is stronger if it derived of one's own accord. Believing that "stealing is wrong just because" will collapse more easily under pressure than "stealing is wrong because it hurts people".</text>
