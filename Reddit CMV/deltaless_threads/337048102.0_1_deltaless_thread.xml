    <title>CMV: Some people want companies to pay a carbon tax, others do not. I believe the best compromise is an optional carbon tax.</title>

    <original_post>There are people who care about climate change who want companies to pay a carbon tax - well they can pressure companies to prove that they're environmentally friendly and they can do that by paying the optional carbon tax. It's like they're saying, hey, we care so much about the environment, that we're willing to pay a tax that we don't even have to pay.

However those who don't care about climate change can remain unaffected by it - they can buy products and use services from companies that refused to pay the optional carbon tax. Also, as I've mentioned before, I don't believe that disadvantaged people should be forced to thank society for treating them like shit or be forced to help people with good lives whilst their lives are miserable - in this scenario, they have a choice. These people can choose not to support companies that pay the optional carbon tax so that way they're not thanking society, they're not helping people with good lives and they can remain completely unaffected by it.

It just seems like a win-win situation to me. So why can't we fight for an optional carbon tax instead? I see literally no problems with it.

    <text>I think any member of management of any company would have a hard time explaining to their shareholders why they reduced profits by paying a tax they didn't have to. </text>

    <text>Yes but they can make up for it because if people see them paying the optional carbon tax, they'll have new customers who will be supporting them.</text>

    <text>There's a big difference between potential new customers and actual decreases in profits. It's "reality"</text>
