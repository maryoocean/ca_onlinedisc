    <title>CMV: "White trash" is an offensive slur, and should not be tolerated in society just as we do not tolerate other bigoted slurs.</title>
    <original_poster>JSmurfington</original_poster>
    <original_post>This has bothered me for a while. The term "white trash" or "trailer trash" fits all the criteria for being a slur which should not be widely acceptable for use. But I have heard the term dropped casually in conversation, and no one seems to treat it like the slur that it is.

It is a term that denigrates and stereotypes a group of people based on their race, appearance, and socioeconomic status. It is meant to be derogatory. This to me is the definition of a bigoted term.

I'm not arguing that the term has as much history behind it as other racial or bigoted slurs. But in our modern society, we should still abandon the term altogether.

    <text>I agree. Im black and it makes me cringe just as other things my brain recognizes as a slur seem to make me cringe. 

But since this is a CMV. 

In my experience I tend to mostly hear middle class white people use the term. And I figure they don't view it as a slur because they haven't experienced the societal affects of oppression and marginalization?

Essentially they lack empathy. </text>
