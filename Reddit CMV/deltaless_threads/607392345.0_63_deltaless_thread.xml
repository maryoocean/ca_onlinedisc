    <title>CMV: Legislative bodies should be required to explain, in formal writing, why they voted a certain way when it comes to legislation.</title>

    <original_post>I think publicly elected officials responsible for driving policy and legislation should be required to explain why they vote certain ways in writing. Voting along party lines is reprehensible regardless of the side. Politics shouldn't be a game about which side wins, but rather which fact-based opinions win regardless of sides. If the legislative bodies have no reasonable explanation for why they voted a certain way besides voting along party lines, they should not be allowed to vote because we have no reason to believe that they're not voting out of self-interest. If, for example, someone in Congress voted against what seems to be reasonable gun law without explanation, but you can see in their financial disclosure that the NRA contributes a lot of money and support for them, how are we to know that their vote was not influenced by the NRA without them explicitly citing so and explaining what other reason compelled them not to vote for said reasonable legislation? I'm not even asking for a long written response from them. A short paragraph or page summary with sources they're using to base their vote on is good enough. </original_post>

    <text>1) Such a requirement would change nothing because it’s always possible to provide a plausible justification even if you really just voted because of campaign contributions. There’s a whole industry of lobbyists dedicated to coming up with sophisticated justifications for legislation.  

2) It is not possible to do everything based on “fact based opinions.”  Some votes will always come down to principles that can’t be argued one way or the other on facts.  Eg one legislator believes the government should provide food for the poor, another thinks that’s not the government’s role.  Neither is “wrong” based on “facts.”

3) Voting along party lines most of the time makes sense because your party is likely to be more in line with the principles you have. </text>
