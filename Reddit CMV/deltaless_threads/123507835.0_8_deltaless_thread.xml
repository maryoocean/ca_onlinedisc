    <title>CMV: There must be some conspiracy or governmental cover-up regarding this missing plane.</title>
    <original_poster>billingsley</original_poster>
    <original_post>There is no way a plane can go missing in the year 2014 without any official having any clue what happened to it. The globe is surveilled every second. I read my license plate from a Google maps view of my house. The NSA has the power to read every piece of digital communication we send... and yet a plane full of people with phones went missing. That cannot be. 
I just don't understand how a plane can go missing. If they get any information at all from the black box, won't that lead them right to it? If the NSA can read my texts and track my phone, can't someone track the phones of the people on the plane? There is 1000 ways for my government to spy on me. When the boston bomber went missing the swat team used heat seeking technology to find him hiding in a boat in someone's back yard. And somehow a $50 million plane disappeared into thin air. With no crash evidence... no nothing.

Something is up. Not sure what, but somebody is up to something. 
CMV?

    <text>&amp;gt;I read my license plate from a Google maps view of my house.

You do realize that those images come from a car driving around with cameras on the roof?

Every inch of the Earth is not under surveillance.  Very little of it is being watched by a satellite with enough detail that it can pick out a plane.

&amp;gt;The NSA has the power to read every piece of digital communication we send... and yet a plane full of people with phones went missing.

Cell phones work by connecting to towers.  Just the altitude of a commercial jet is far enough to not allow standard cell phone communication.

&amp;gt;If they get any information at all from the black box, won't that lead them right to it?

The black boxes (there are two) need to be found, they were both in the tail of the aircraft.  They both transmit a signal, but that signal doesn't work very well under water, and the transponder can be damaged in a crash.

&amp;gt;When the boston bomber went missing the swat team used heat seeking technology to find him hiding in a boat in someone's back yard. 

Yes, and they had a rough idea where he was and were searching a small area.

This plane went down in he ocean, a massive area.  Once the plane sinks there is going to be zero heat signature that can be seen by a Search plane.  Also, since a plane isn't a living thing, it would stop giving off any heat shortly after crashing into the ocean.

&amp;gt;a $50 million plane disappeared into thin air.

Into the ocean, and they run closer to $300 million.

Here this article, written by a pilot, gives a very reasonable explanation to what probably happened:

TL:DR  The plane probably suffered an electrical fire that knock out all communication, including the flight transponder.  After the fire, the pilots while trying to repair, changed course to the nearest airport, and eventually lost the battle and crashed into the water.

Unfortunately air planes sometimes do crash, due to equipment failure or human error.  And sometimes, it takes years to find the wreckage.</text>
