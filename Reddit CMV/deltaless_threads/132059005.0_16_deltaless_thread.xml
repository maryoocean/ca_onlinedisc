    <title>CMV: I think masturbation is bad for you.</title>
    <original_poster>TextingWhileDriving</original_poster>
    <original_post>I used to be part of the /r/NoFap community and felt good about it. I had a sense of pride when a day passed without masturbation squeezed in there. However, I never went longer than 2 weeks without masturbating. Each time I masturbated I felt a sense of dread and depression, knowing I would just masturbate again sometime later. 

Today I broke my 4 day streak. I feel depressed and stressed. This basically confirms how I felt about masturbation in the beginning. It's bad for you. You could change my view with study's or from experience yourself. Go ahead and try changing my view. </original_post>

    <text>I'm a tad late but what ever. Masturbation in itself isn't inherently bad. Self pleasure is one of the most basic things humans do. Babies in the womb have been recorded doing it.

  Why do you feel so upset when you do it?  If it is just a self control thing I get that. Some people  like to think that they are in charge of themselves. Masturbation isn't so much the issue there, but more your frustration at not having control over your desires. There is a difference.
