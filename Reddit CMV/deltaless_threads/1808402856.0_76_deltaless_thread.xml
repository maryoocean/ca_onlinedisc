    <title>CMV: Fredom of speech is far more important than a few people being offended</title>

    <original_post>Freedom of speech should be protected and kept, there shouldn't be people arrested for anti trans comments or insulting a soldier/soldiers, or for nazi jokes, or racist remarks or jokes.

Those should all be handled between people, if someone says stuff you dont like you handle it, simply block them or avoid them, theres a whole world you can be in and that persons in a very tiny part of it. 

It makes me nervous seeing people arrested and charged for saying things. It's only leading us to a place where we can be arrested for saying whatever the government doesnt like. And they shouldn't be in that much power to effect our communication with eachother. 

I live in scotland and dont feel I have freedom of speech anymore. 

(For the record I'm a white woman who's bi and have trans thoughts ig for those folks who say it never has been about me, it has sometimes, and in more ways than just those)

Edit: No it's not just anti trans people, Yes I believe crimes other than hate crimes involving speech should be illegal (threatening violence, doxing, defamation) but I also believe insults, jokes and bad takes or thoughts should not be.

Edit 2: Consequences for what is said like losing a job, getting insulted, losing friends ect is totally fine I just dont think the Government should be in charge of what can get you arrested in this sence.

Edit 3: I live in SCOTLAND in the UNITED KINGDOM or in BRITAIN depending what you say, I'm not american, im also not here advocating for my right to be a dick, im just saying the government arent the ones I want saying what I cant say, I mean twitter can destroy lives without them anyway.</original_post>

    <text>Freedom of speech should be absolute IMO.

Freedom from the consequences of that speech is an entirely different matter.</text>

    <text>If those consequences come from the government or even from others in a manner that impedes your rights, then it isn't freedom of speech.

The whole "freedom of X isn't freedom from consequences" notion is one made by people who have zero understanding of the law, the constitution, and the intents behind them.</text>

No argument there.

My point being that in my view, freedom of speech must be complete. Because as soon as you allow *some* types of speech to be banned then you're opening the door to allow *any* type of speech to be banned, all based on the subjective whims of those doing the banning.

The government should not ban even the most awful, vile of speech... but if a private citizen wants to hold you accountable for what you said, that is their choice.</text>
