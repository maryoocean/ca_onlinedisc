    <title>CMV: It is illogical to not believe in Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>LAMARR__44</original_poster>
    <original_post>Many people either believe in Hard Determinism or Compatibilism. I will argue that both are illogical.

Both argue that human actions are extensions of factors we do not have a choice over. Compatibilism seems to say we are still free but just redefines free will to the internal factors behind a decision, but the decision is still decided by a chain of events outside of our control.

My argument is a sort of wager argument. Either libertarian free will exists or it doesn’t. If it exists and we believe in it, we have made a free decision where we are right. If libertarian free will doesn’t exist, the decision to believe in libertarian free will was out of our control.

So either we have a choice and we can make the right choice, or we don’t have a choice and were determined to be wrong.

Thus it makes more sense to believe in libertarian free will since it’s potentially the only one where we have a chance to make a right choice, if determinism is true there is no choice, so there’s no value in being right.</original_post>

    <text>What is your vice? Maybe you're lucky and don't have one. Tell an alcoholic his free will can be used to stop drinking. Tell a smoker is just their free will to stop. It's obviously not that simple. We are ruled by our life circumstance. Free will is an illusion imo</text>

    <text>Free will doesn’t just mean that you can do every action easily. But telling these guys that they can quit if they put in the effort and truly want it will more positively impact their lives rather than just saying “yeah you were determined to be a crackhead dw about it bro”</text>

    <text>I think youre missing my point. Your decisions are based more on your lived experience than pure free will.</text>

    <text>True, but saying they’re determined is wrong.</text>

    <text>I didn't say that. I'll circle back here. A smoker knows its bad and would rather not do it. It's not that easy. There must be something that overrides this free will.</text>
