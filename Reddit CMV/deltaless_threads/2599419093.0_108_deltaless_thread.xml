    <title>CMV: the way that conservatives have got in line behind Trump shows that they never really believed in anything in the first place, apart from belonging to a tribe and beating the other tribe.</title>

    <original_post>As things stand, Trump has already been chosen as a presidential candidate once and is massively in the lead to be chosen again. Yet he seems to go against traditional conservative values in so many respects. 

* Family values: he's a known adulterer, "grab 'em by the pussy" etc.
* Religion: clownishly ignorant about the Bible
* Managerial competence: ignorant of basic facts about world and US affairs
* Honest dealing: on his own admission he's exploited bankruptcy rules several times to get out of debts. And where are the tax returns?
* Promises kept: where's the money from Mexico for the wall? Where's the "beautiful" healthcare plan that we were promised?
* Decorum: I don't think I need to say much about this one. Belittling, name-calling, tantrums, the list goes on.
* Democracy: "if I lose then it was rigged". This is probably the biggest of them all. 

I understand that some conservatives have distanced themselves. But the majority of the GOP seems to be behind him. What explains this, except for wanting to feel like you're in the in-group, and wanting to own the stupid libs?</original_post>

    <text>People miss when bread was cheaper. People miss when rent was cheaper. While it's debatable as to how each presidents economic policies affect these prices, most people don't have the time to get to the bottom of that.

People also miss order. The rising crime waves in several cities which are under Democrat leadership is pushing people to the side that supports law enforcement.

People understand that many government agencies are corrupt, and believed this long before Trump came along.  The FBI's consant opposition to Trump is just further cementing this. 

People don't want war. Trump was the first president in a long time to not get the US directly involved in a new war. While Biden is on track to continue this, our increasing involvement in the Ukranian war at the behest of taxpayers is making a lot of conservatives bitter. Quite frankly, the Democrats newfound obsession with war is a result of a desire to "beat the other tribe". 

Also, many of the things Trump didn't accomplish were because of opposition from people who didn't like him.</text>
