    <title>CMV: Kink and BDSM should not be at public pride events and should be kept for 18+ ones</title>
    <original_poster>akoudagawaismywaifu</original_poster>
    <original_post>To start, I am a lesbian. And I've been seeing recent controversy about this topic. 

Look, no denying that kink plays a big role in the creation of pride. It is a part of embracing sexuality and shouldn't be excluded from the community. 

However, it should not be at public pride parades. Pride should be for everyone of all ages. Many people say "stop catering to the straight capitalized ideal of what pride should be" and "pride isn't a party, it's a protest don't police us" and "children should go to disney if they want family friendly" This has nothing to do with straight rainbow capitalism. I figured out I was LGBT at age 11 and trust me if I saw a kink act in public I would be kind of disgusted. I'm still a minor now, and I'd be less disgusted but still. I know people say that it's up to you to bring your children to pride, but by making all pride events "wear whatever you want even if it's nothing" we are also kinda excluding minors from it. It's also non consensual to anyone who is exposed to such acts, because nobody wants to go to pride to see naked people right? The "think of the children" phrase holds true here. Young children and teens embracing their sexuality shouldn't be forced to see adult acts against their will. 

Again, no denying the role kink plays in the community, but it should be kept at 18+ events. There should definitely be a separate pride for people who just want to do leather and other kinks. That way, you can do whatever you want in a safe space where you know you won't offend others, and because people consented to come to an 18+ event, it's all good. 

That's just my personal opinion on it, but it seems to be the minority. I'd like to see how you guys think about this.

Edit: it appears after reading and responding to several comments, I don't really have a problem with kink, but more with public indecency. I don't care if you wear a collar or leather pants. But I'd rather not see things that could get you arrested or questioned for doing in public.</original_post>

    <text>Well one it’s a public gathering so you’re just pissing in the wind if you expect the public to tip toe around everyone’s feelings. Again it’s public and if you don’t like what you see from a certain individual walk 20 feet to your left or right and you can focus your attention on something less (lack of a better word(s)) “eye soaring” also it sounds like you’re just against any form of nudity within public eye which makes sense to an extent but how the pride parade is you bring so many different people together and different cultures and ways of life that the general idea that everyone is going to be appropriately dressed or wearing “child friendly” attire is the equivalent of going into a mattress store and expecting to come out with a telescope. Though my advice is bc of how sensitive people are today :/ I wouldn’t be yanking chains and calling out bdsm and kink people at this parade mainly because you might receive some not so friendly remarks and if you’re one for being fragile towards confrontation and people speaking their opinions in your face then you might want to check yourself at the door before you end up doing the whole “out of the frying pan and into the fire” dance. If that’s your prerogative and you choose to do such then do what you want because again this is Reddit and I’m just some random giving my advice even if it’s not good advice.</text>
