    <title>There is no good alternative to a democratic form of government. CMV</title>

    <original_post>I think all governments should be based on individual liberty and democracy. And statism, monarchy, autocracy, and dictatorships are ALWAYS bad.

I'm not going to elaborate on exactly why I think so, at least not here, I just want you to argue why I'm wrong.</original_post>

I'd like a solid historical example of anarchno-capitalism before dismissing it.</text>

    <text>He never mentioned anarcho-capitalism.  

But, since you asked:

[Utopia, Ohio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia,_Ohio), founded on market based economy and individualism, dissolved after cheap sources of land dried up

[Modern Times, New York](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentwood,_New_York), founded on the principles of individual sovernty and mutualism, dissolved after non-ancaps moved in and set up a more standard form of government.  The ancaps were unable to stop them, since they didn't have a form of government.  </text>
