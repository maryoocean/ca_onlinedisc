    <title>CMV: Christianity is held together through fear</title>
    <original_poster>M1STER_B0NES</original_poster>
    <original_post>My opinion is that if the fear of going to Hell was not present in the Christian ideology, then most of the followers of the religion would not be there.

Before I decided I was agnostic, that was my only reason for continuing to identify with the religion. Then, I decided I wasn't going to let fear control me. 

All in all, I don't see how this is any different than blackmailing a person to do what you want. You present your instruction, then tell them how you will completely devastate their life if they do not follow through.</original_post>

    <text>I really dont think the fear of hell is a selling point in Christianity. I think most Christians follow Christ because they acknowledge they need a new captain for their life. They realize they cant do it alone anymore and turn to Christ who can redeem anyone. Its not that they are afraid of hell its they realize they are on a path to hell by not following Christ. I just dont know anyone that follows Christ bc they dont want to go to hell. It just seems like a weak conviction. It seems if u only go through the motions of being a Christian bc you dont want to go to hell you arent really certain in your faith. It seems like an excuse to not abandon the faith. </text>
