    <title>CMV: Taylor Swift is the best artist of the 21st century and is on track to become the best artist of all time.</title>
    <original_poster>DesperateForYourDick</original_poster>
    <original_post>Note that here, “best” means most popular, most successful, most famous, etc. I am in no way saying that her music is the objective best music to listen to or anything like that.

Taylor Swift is a cultural phenomenon. Yes, her music is stereotypical “basic white girl music” (which is a problematic belief that many hold that I won’t get into here), but way too many people deny that she’s an all-time great just to be controversial, quirky, different, etc.

[Here is a quick list of her awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Taylor_Swift)

In addition to those, she has been on top of Billboard Artist 100 for **81 weeks**. She is the only artist to take up **every single spot** on the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time. She has multiple songs (Love Story, You Belong With Me, Shake it Off, We Are Never Getting Back Together) that have stood the test of time for a decade and will likely be classics at least on the level of songs like Hey Jude, or even We Will Rock You.

Furthermore, the Eras Tour is arguably already the most famous concert tour ever. Going by current numbers it will absolutely demolish the record for highest grossing concert tour, which was set by Elton John’s Farewell Yellow Brick Road. And it’ll do so with just 1/3 the number of concerts.

Just look at the NFL. Their Twitter account changed their profile picture, bio, and banner just because Taylor Swift showed up to a Chiefs game. To have that level of influence over the most popular sports league in the United States is insane.

Yes, I’m a big fan of her work. But even objectively speaking, I don’t see how anyone can deny that, when she does retire, she will be one of the greatest artists to ever live, just in terms of objective popularity.

And just to directly address the claims made in my title—I for one cannot name any artist with more name recognition in the 20th century. “Taylor Swift” is, at this point, used as the default name-drop for “stereotypically popular singer”. And her current level of popularity/fame is on par with any great artist (say, for example, the Beatles or Michael Jackson) at their peak, which is why I think she has a shot at becoming #1 all time.</original_post>

This isn’t a “problematic belief” it’s an *objective reality*. Look at any footage of the Eras tour anywhere. It’s the *least diverse* crowd you will see for any musician.

The passion of Swifty fans like yourself kinda of blinds you to the reality that *huge percentages* of the population give no fucks about here whatsoever.

Swift is a talented musician and her differentiation is being able to lean into a several genre hybrids… but she innovated in none of them.

I don’t think you can have any reasonable claim to “greatest artist” type titles without broad / universal appeal and major innovation.

&gt; she has been on top of Billboard Artist for 81 weeks

If you want to start rattling of awards, you’re cherry picking and dodging a couple big ones.

Rihanna has sold more albums than Swift, and again here audience far broader 

Eminem has solid quite a bit more, with far bigger impact.

Both of them have compelling arguments to best.

&gt; classics on the level of songs like Hey Jude or even We Will Rock You

That’s a pretty comical take. I’m not even going to address it.

&gt; the Eras Tour is arguably the most famous concert tour ever

There’s major, major recency bias here. The eras tour had a moment, largely due to TikTok and similar social media apps. 

But you must recognize that TikTok/Instagram/etc have self reinforcing algorithms that show you stuff you like. It becomes easy to believe what you like is this bigger / more impactful than it is.

The most famous concert tours ever is a long list. I’d probably put Lollapalooza at the top here (though it was multi artist)… but like Elton John, Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones, and Zeppelin tours were all bigger in their times - again, the more universal audience.

&gt; highest grossing concert tour 

This is a bad metric. Because of inflation, more recent tours will always have higher nominal sales numbers. All this “record” shows is that it’s the most recent mega arena tour, and that she charges a ton for tickets.

&gt; I cannot name any artist with more name recognition than Taylor swift 

Again, it’s recency bias. She’s having a moment, that’s for sure.

Take any non-Swifty fan and play a bunch of music, and they will have a harder time picking out Swift songs relative to other greats because her voice / style isn’t especially distinct.

&gt; her level of polarity/fame is on par with any great artist (say, for example, the Beatles or Michael Jackson)

Michael Jackson might have been the singularly most famous person ever.

The levels of fame achieved by Beatles/Jackson are next level, and Taylor Swift is *not even close* to those two.</text>
