    <title>CMV: There is no reason a “God” should give Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>Protagoras67</original_poster>
    <original_post>I want to disclose that I am both an atheist and a hard determinist. I do not believe in any sort of creator and I have a hard time believing in Free Will. From what I understand from a Christian perspective, God gives humans free will in an effort to test them. But what i don’t understand from their point of view is why would God do that in the first place? Isn’t God omnipotent? God could just design the universe however it wants, we could have all been programmed to behave a certain way from birth and believe in God from birth and follow one religion as opposed to having a myriad of them. There is no reason to test us, it’s completely unnecessary.

Again, I’m not challenging anyone to prove God exists, I am just trying to understand the theological logic of this.</original_post>

    <text>You’re right, god knows us perfectly, so what tests us? Because you don’t know yourself. Free will has nothing to do with what god wants us to do, he does want us to believe in him and follow what he says, but even if someone does or doesn’t, he already knew that, but we didn’t. He might know what we’re going to, but we don’t, so the pint of being “tested” is for us to judge ourselves on well we think we did at being good, and where we would feel most comfortable at the end.</text>
