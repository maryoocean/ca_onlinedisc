    <title>CMV: Pregnant women should be automatically registered to donate their afterbirths for stem cell research (with an opt-out option).</title>
    <original_poster>Ragdoll_Proletariat</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm a Catholic and my father received stem cell treatment a few years ago. It massively improved his quality of life. I learned shortly beforehand that a woman's afterbirth and its core blood contains a lot of stem cells which can be used, to the point that women can actually donate them. I think this should be made an automatic process because of the following reasons:

1. There's no religious debate about harming an embryo because the baby has already been born, meaning that Christian women could help move this forward.
2. Afterbirths normally go in the bin which is a waste of stem cells.
3. Most women don't know this is an option so wouldn't opt into it.

I believe this would hasten research opportunities and consequently medical developments.

I write this with the caveat that women who want to eat it/frame it/etc can opt out in the same way as with UK organ donation. I'm not a doctor of course so I'm wondering if there's anything I'm missing here. I'm interested in seeing people's thoughts on this.</original_post>

Why not just have it presented as an option to opt into then?

With that many donations, seems like they'd probably mostly end up wasted anyway.  None of what you said suggests that there is a shortage.  Seems like if there was a shortage, the organizations that accept them would at least be trying to raise awareness of the option, which I don't see any of that happening.</text>

It's a libertarian paternalism idea. People are less likely to opt-out than opt-in. 

As promising as stem cell therapies are, it's still largely an emerging technology. Most uses are still considered "experimental" even if they are FDA approved. Organizations involved in stem cell research are expending more effort in getting therapies more accepted and visible.

In the future, they may be as in demand as blood or organs as they become more readily prescribed. It's useful to prepare for the  eventuality.</text>

    <text>Actually you can already opt in to freeze these stem cells. Costs money yearly, but can be lifesaving if a situation ever arises when they can be used. My uncle did it with all three of his children.</text>

    <text>Donating the cord blood was presented to me as an option when I had my eldest a decade ago.</text>

    <text>My main thought is that my country already has an opt-out for organ donors and this could be something that is added to that same section where a doctor would be easily able to see it.

I'm not entirely sure there is a shortage of afterbirths but stem cells in general are definitely something we need. Most of the ways of getting to them are painful (bone marrow donation) or have political and religious debate (embryos),both of which can deter people from signing up as donors. I also question how much money the organisation actually have to take awareness given that the specific thing they're trying to accumulate isn't financial donations.</text>

    <text>I don't know if this is just something the hospital my wife gave birth in does, but she signed a document giving permission to put the stem cells in a stem cell bank. When she was pregnant, we looked into storing stem cells but after a talk with the ob/gyn, they explained it was basically an outdated way to deal with it and donating it like donating blood was the most prudent option.</text>
