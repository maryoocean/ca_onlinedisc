    <title>CMV: Modern marriage in the US brings more harm than benefit for men.</title>
    <original_poster>cannibalstreudel</original_poster>
    <original_post>I believe based on marriage laws and divorce practices that marriage no longer has more benefits than harm for men.

For women it's the opposite. I believe this because whether laws state this or not, practices in divorce court often grant kids' custody to the mother from the father when they aren't more dangerous to their kids than their wife. And often men have to give up half their income/assets in divorce when they often make most of the income of the household.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Sure there are emotional benefits to a long term relationship. But there aren't extra benefits for men on top of an emotionally committed relationship that exclusively comes with marriate.

The security marriage itself brings is only for the woman. She gets to enjoy financial guarantee of sharing income when men often make more than women, and she can be assured of his fidelity - it's backed up by government enforcement... women rarely are punished for fucking another guy and being impregnated at the level men are, and often the man in the marriage gets cucked and is made responsible for raising another man's child.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Men are bringing unnecessary vulnerabilities on themselves when they marry a woman in modern US courts.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

If someone can reliably demonstrate that marriage gives more potential benefit to men than potential harm, I would believe marriage brings more benefit than harm to men. And to be clear, I'm not talking about long term relationships, I'm talking about specifically signing a marriage document and putting the law behind the union.</original_post>

    <text>If she's the breadwinner of the house and he decides to watch the kids then you have a point. It'll be more even between positives/negatives or even more positive. I wouldn't make this decision in my relationships and I know many men who would also not choose this path. For people like us it's still more harm than benefit.</text>

    <text>Right. I'd disagree with the view as it is, but it seems like OP is saying marriage is not advantageous for people with certain characteristics. He should focus on those characteristics, IMO, not the fact that most of those people tend to be men. Because other than possibly family court, nothing is actually inherent to being a man.</text>

    <text>I'm talking about masculine men, the breadwinner. If you want to debate the validity of traditional masculine/feminine roles and their place in modern society, that's a completely different thread. In this post I'm questioning the benefit of marriage for the man, or primary provider if you prefer to think about it that way. I don't believe marriage helps the primary provider.</text>

    <text>Ok I see nobody is going to be able to convince you that point so I guess we will move on. 
  
Extreme examples like athletes and actors aside, do you not agree that in most relationships support from a partner might allow that breadwinner to further their career?</text>

    <text>Feel free to start your own CMV about masculine/feminine roles and I'll respond. Just message me so I see it. I just don't want to convolute the focus of my post by opening another Pandora's box. Support from a wife for sure allows the man to further his career. That doesn't necessarily mean she's entitled to half the proceeds from said career.</text>

    <text>So you don't want to be the one to give up your career to take care of the kids, but you hold it against women for making less?  They often make less BECAUSE they're more willing to give up their career to be a stay at home mother, or at least putting their career on hold for a while to take care of the kid before they start school.  Or focus on taking jobs that give them better work-life balance so they can spend more time with kids.

In fact, single women in their 20s [make more](http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2015274,00.html) money than single men in their 20's.

So yes, women make less... because of things like men asking them to put their career on hold for the sake of their kids.</text>

    <text>How is them doing something (giving up their career, putting it on hold, or giving it a lower priority) you may have asked them to do because you're unwilling to do yourself harmful to you?

If you don't want kids, fine, then don't have kids and find a women that doesn't want kids, there are plenty.

But if you do want kids, someone has to take care of those kids and it is expensive.  One way that expense often manifests is through women taking more flexible jobs, part-time jobs, or completely giving up their jobs. To then turn around and claim that women making less money is a harm to you is a bit like trying to have your cake and eat it too.</text>

    <text>I'm not saying I'm against providing for my girl. I'm saying putting the law behind it is unnecessary and holds no benefit for the man. If me and my girl build trust over time showing that I'm willing to provide her financial support, then a marriage certificate is redundant and harmful to me. It only puts extra undue pressure on me, with guarantees only to her.</text>

    <text>You're describing a very unhealthy and unsafe environment for women.  That's your ideal.  Anyone that would give up their career in that kind of relationship is a fool.

You're basically pushing them into a position to be financially dependent on you.  And then if it doesn't work out, they're out on the street with a career they destroyed because you asked them to.

Seriously? You want them to trust that out of the goodness of your heart and without being forced by the courts you'd send your ex a check every month without the law getting involved?

There is nothing unfair about the default divorce proceedings.  Things you owned before the marriage are yours.  Things you earned during the marriage are split 50/50.  If you established a relationship where they are financially dependent on you, then you can also pay alimony.  If you don't take 50/50 custody, then you could owe child payments.  It's all extremely fair and extremely warranted.

If you don't want alimony payments, don't date someone without a job and don't encourage them to give up their job once married.  If you don't want child support payments either don't have a child OR simply agree to take 50% custody.  There is nothing unreasonable about saying that everything earned during the marriage should be split 50/50.</text>

    <text>"You're describing a very unhealthy and unsafe environment for women."

So marriage is for women's benefit? And not men? This is exactly my point... It helps women but it doesn't help men. Not talking about the validity of this claim at all, just highlighting the reasoning behind it.

As for trust and needing marriage to force me to do what we've decided, I see your point. It's assurance for the woman that if she decides to become financially dependent on me then she has recourse if I abandon her. This does prove my point though - it's for the woman's benefit. That may be a good choice in the relationship particularly if we decide to have kids. But it's definitely for the woman's benefit, and it's an obligation, vulnerability
 and responsibility on the man's plate.</text>

    <text>This is all only relevant if you aren't dating someone with their own job or that makes significantly less than you.  If you're really worried about that then sign an unfair prenup that favors the man or marry someone with a similar professional level.

Or hell, be the stay at home dad in your relationship. I  know you said you don't want to, but there is nothing inherent about marriage that protects women. It protects stay at home parents.  It protects kids.

You alleged a bunch of court bias, but the court just isn't involved in the vast majority of cases.  It really is a lot more fair than you give it credit.

&amp;gt; So marriage is for women's benefit? And not men? This is exactly my point... 

Only if you completely ignore the fact that a woman giving up her financial stability to quit her job isn't a benefit to the woman.

If you don't have kids, there is no reason to be dating someone making significantly less than you, so don't.</text>

    <text>No, the woman giving up her career and her body for a child is not a benefit to the woman, and if we're honest about how marriage is a structure to rebalance the biological vulnerability a woman has when devoting her body to a baby by mandating the man provide her with his own vulnerability then we can have an honest discussion about marriage. But championing it as great for both parties intrinsically is a lie and hurts honest discussions about the validity of the institution.</text>

    <text>Got a break at work so I'm responding to what I can. I'm talking about masculine men. I don't want to go on several tangents and distract from the original cmv, so if you want to replace "men" as "breadwinner" it's accurate enough, challenging that view is a whole other post.</text>

    <text>Typically, yes he is. Because men are much less likely to be awarded alimony: Women are leading earners in 40% of households, but only 3%(!) of men receive alimony upon divorce. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

This presents a clear harm to the male... and seems to reinforce OP's point.</text>

    <text>I dont know the specifics of where this stat came from, but it seems like it could be misleading. Alimony is awarded based on a significant difference in income. It makes more sense to pull up stats on the median difference in income, rather than who makes more. Also would make sense to look specifically at divorced couples rather than all households.</text>
