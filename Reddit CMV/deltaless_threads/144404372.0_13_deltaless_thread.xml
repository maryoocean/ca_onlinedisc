    <title>CMV: The release of the CCTV footage of Michael Brown is not character assassination, but a vital component of the incident that helps all parties understand the context of the shooting and the state of mind of the individuals involved.</title>
    <original_poster>Thorax123</original_poster>
    <original_post>First off, let me clarify, I am not defending the actions of Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. I believe that he did use excessive force and the shooting should be thoroughly investigated. This CMV post is not to debate over whether or not Officer Wilson needs to be tried or whether the Ferguson Police is an example of police militarisation in the US. This post is solely to look at the decision to release the CCTV footage of Michael Brown robbing a convenience store.

Now that that's out of the way, I don't really understand why everyone was so angry at the release of the CCTV footage showing what appears to be Michael Brown robbing a convenience store. I see in multiple news sources where people have stated that the footage "'appeared to cast aspersions' on the dead man" or is a form of character assassination.*

Finding out that the shooting victim had just returned from robbing a store is critical information, because it provides context for the fact that a police officer confronted him (over something minor and unrelated like obstructing the street) and a violent altercation took place soon after. I see family members and other people saying that he wasn't "perfect," but it seems to me that they're dismissing the fact that he had just committed a crime.* The police officer may not have known of Michael Brown's actions, but it makes sense that Michael Brown would be more on-edge, scared, and impulsive after committing a crime and encountering a police officer so soon after. Thus, this footage provides a critical perspective into Michael Brown's state of mind and his subsequent mannerisms/behavior might have alerted Officer Wilson and escalated the encounter.

My view is that the CCTV footage was essential information that needed to be provided to the public. While it may have been misconstrued as character assassination, the footage is an invaluable part of the story that helps explain the context and actions of both Officer Wilson and Michael Brown. 

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your comments! I really appreciate it. My view hasn't really changed and while I still believe the footage to be relevant and needed to be shown to the public, the institution releasing the footage should have been more removed from the situation i.e. not FPD, but the FBI/DoJ/even the Prosecutor's Office. Additionally, the footage should have been released alongside other information which was excluded, providing a lop-sided view of the situation which served to inflame tensions rather than using information to allay them.

Edit: Thanks for the gold, stranger!

    <text>Absolute rubbish. The only important issue here is whether the officer had a logical and legal reason to shoot the victim.

It is on the record that the officer that shot Brown did not know about the alleged theft.

This is the same victim shaming that went on in theTrayvon Martin case.

People are looking for a reason to invalidate the life of another young black man. 

By your argument I would assume we should expect the full employment history (including complaints) from the officer whom shot Brown. 

You know because context is very important.</text>

I'm sorry...I thought, when it was all said and done, George Zimmerman was found not guilty of murder/manslaughter, and, among other things, the "victim" actually had Mr. Zimmerman pinned to the ground when he was shot. Is the release of factual information "victim shaming" now?</text>

    <text>The case went to court and Zimmerman was found not guilty that does not make trayvon less a victim.
Unless you are willing to grant that Nicole brown and Ron Goldman are also not victims  because the accused wasn't convicted.</text>

    <text>This is a horrible comparison to make. In Trayvon Martin's case, it was a given fact that George Zimmerman killed him. The question was, were the circumstances of the killing consistent with homicide, or with self-defense. The ruling in that case was that Trayvon Martin was not murdered.

In the OJ Simpson case, the deaths of Brown and Goldman were ruled murders from the start. The question was not **if** they were murdered, but rather who did it. The jury found that OJ Simpson did not do it due to a lack of evidence proving his guilt, but never brought into question whether the couple was murdered vs. killed in self defense.</text>
