    <title>CMV: Countries like Canada and the UK have a more illogical system of units then the US</title>
    <original_poster>Tommyblockhead20</original_poster>
    <original_post>Foreigners and even many Americans like to criticize or make fun of the United States for being one of the few countries to not adopt the metric system de facto, and talk about how illogical their system is. However I see little to no criticism aimed at countries like Canada or the UK that I find to have much more illogical systems of units. 

These countries use a mix of both metric and imperial. While the US may learn a worse system then metric, at least it is consistent in its usage (yes there are a number of specific areas metric is used but a vast majority of Americans don’t know the metric system because they don’t need to). But in Canada and the UK, they have to learn 2 completely different systems and switch between the two based on the context and usage. [There’s this popular post](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/e1hx4f/how_to_choose_measuring_units_in_canada/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=mweb) on r/coolguides about all the different times when metric or imperial is used, this is the only time I have really seen either of these countries be made fun of.

Now I’m not surprised and I don’t blame the citizens, it is inevitable old systems stick around when they are so ingrained in a culture. But I think that’s one of the reasons it’s best the US doesn’t try to switch systems, we’ve already seen what will happen, but that’s a whole nother discussion.

Is having 2 systems not more illogical then 1? Why does the US receive the most criticism for its system of units?</original_post>

    <text>As you say, I think it's because "a vast majority of Americans don’t know the metric system". Thus, when Americans attempt to communicate with the rest of the world they don't know what's going on and this causes issues.

I'm from the UK, and similarly to your Canada chart we use metric or imperial in various contexts (NB UK seems  slightly more metric leaning than Canada based on your chart).  But regardless of the context, everyone would understand you if you used the other system. And importantly, when talking to colleagues from the rest of the world or for any kind of scientific work metric would be used and understood perfectly well.

The UK is becoming more metric over time as well, as the older generation who only learnt imperial die out. The preference for younger generations is much more towards metric.</text>
