    <original_post>I don't think guns can be effectively used for self-defence.

First of something about me, maybe it'll be useful somehow. I live in Germany and I'm not that opposed to gun possession. And as the USA is the only major western country I know of which has these major gun issues I'm interested in the reasons why the USA doesn't impose stricter gun laws.

One of the major reasons I heard of, as to why a great amount of US-Americans want to have loose gun laws, is for self-defence and also for the fact that otherwise the "bad guys" would just have all the guns, as they can just get it from the black market. It may be true, but I don't really see how the possession of guns can help you with self-defence. The only way I see a gun can help someone is if this someone carries it all the time and even then it may most likely be contraproductive.

I mean let's say a criminal approaches you, how could a gun help you? Most criminals use a weapon, be it a knife or a gun, for intimidation, so that they are more convincing convincing you to give them what they want (usually money or other valuables). Unless the criminal is a complete idiot, he will try to surprise the victim. 

So, he surprised you and now holds a knife or a gun at you and demands your money or other valubles. How can a gun help you? If you take out the gun, the criminal may panic, as he sees a risk to his life, and may kill or harm you severely in the process, even if he didn't want it. You may be lucky and the criminal freezes, because of the panic,  however most criminals are more or less mentally prepared for these situations, at least better than the victims which are mostly caught off-guard. And is it really worth it risking that he'll freeze? And in the end it could be you who'll freeze, as again criminals are usually more mentally prepared for this then the victims. In the end you either exchanged or almost exchanged your life for some valubles.

If a criminal really wants to kill you, usually you won't even have a chance to defend yourself, as sad as it sounds. I mean if the criminal wanted your death, he would just shoot you in case of a gun or just cut open your throat from behind. He could even just take a big stone and smash it into your head. Of course there are also those who will "bully" (?) you and only than kill you, but if I'm correctly informed, it's relatively seldom.

Or did I got it wrong as to how a gun can be used for self-defence? If yes how else can a gun be used for self-defence?

In short, I think a gun would only escalate a pseudo-dangerous situation to a real dangerous situation most of the time. I'm not saying that there aren't situations where having a gun is good for self-defence, but most of the time it won't help or might even be contraproductive.

If I got the fact wrong, that people want guns for self-defence, than why are people worrying about "the bad guys" having all the guns?

Thx in advance.

PS: In this post with "criminal" I mean somewhat between the line of "someone who attacks or intimidates people with a weapon (usually knife or gun)".

EDIT: It may be somewhat relevant, though I might have added it earlier. I'm doing self-defence (Krav Maga) for several years already. I'm by no means a professional, but I have enough self-defence knowledge to have some say. And most facts I said are the stuff we were taught. 
Here's me giving some insight: Most people don't know how easy and how hard self-defence can be. E.g. even if you hit the criminal, he won't die directly, except you hit certain keyspots and because of adrenaline he won't feel as much pain as normally. Thus if he got a knife or a gun at you, and you shoot him, there is nontheless a high percentage that you will be harmed severely. Also, so many don't realize how lethal a person who has at least some knowledge with knives can be. At the time you are getting your gun out, he might have hit you already several times.

EDIT2: It maybe somewhat too late, but I noticed I accidentally  misformulated my view quite heavilyt. I don't think "I don't think guns can be effectively used for self-defence", but rather "I don't think most humans can effectively use a gun for self-defence". I know it's somewhat late to "change" my view, but if somebody still answers this post that's what I meant. I maybe repost it with a better formulated view some time later.</original_post>

You can keep it in your bedroom and grab it if you hear someone breaking into your house. You can keep it in your car and have it ready in a case of road rage. You can also choose to carry it in high-risk situations like walking home by yourself in the dark. You are only focusing on a single situation where you are caught by surprise.

&amp;gt; And is it really worth it risking that he'll freeze? And in the end it could be you who'll freeze, as again criminals are usually more mentally prepared for this then the victims. In the end you either exchanged or almost exchanged your life for some valubles.

What if it's not valuables? Suppose you get singled out because they don't like your ethnicity. Maybe someone intends to rape you. Either you submit and possibly get killed anyway, or you have a fighting chance with a gun. The more prevalent guns are, the more risky this type of theft becomes. Will thieves continue stealing when their potential victims might shoot them?</text>

Well good point about the house breaking. But are American road rages that frequent and violent that one requires a gun? Somewhat off-topic, but in both cases a taser would be more appropriate IMO.

That's actually the situation I was describing. If it's dark and you are alone and someone catches you from behind or from a corner, or maybe someone who just seems to ask a question.

&amp;gt;What if it's not valuables? Suppose you get singled out because they don't like your ethnicity. Maybe someone intends to rape you. Either you submit and possibly get killed anyway, or you have a fighting chance with a gun.

But are these scenarios that much more frequent in the USA than someone who wants to rob you with?

I don't know whether you mean by stealing breaking in houses or robbing on the streat, but if you mean the last one, personally I don't think it's the case. I think that the thefts will get just more violent. Usually if I'm not completely wrong, people who do those crimes either are poor or are people who are very high on the anti-social scale.

EDIT: You didn't change my view, but I didn't think about using a gun in case of a house breaking. It does make sense have a gun in this case IMO. Have your delta âˆ† . Though I'm still somewhat sceptical whether it's good in USA's context, since US-Americans in general have guns, they might be prepared and thus have guns too. This could make it rather dangerous.</text>

Unfortunately, it happens. A gun is like insurance. You don't plan on killing people, but it's there just in case you need it.

&amp;gt; Somewhat off-topic, but in both cases a taser would be more appropriate IMO.

A taser requires you to be close to the target; close enough to put yourself at risk. The other type of taser gives you one quick shot. What happens if you miss?

&amp;gt; If it's dark and you are alone and someone catches you from behind or from a corner, or maybe someone who just seems to ask a question.

Someone could pop out from an alley and surprise you, and there is nothing you could do about it. There is a case where someone sees you from across the street and starts to follow you. You might also be in an open area like a parking lot where someone starts to approach you. In those cases, you can be prepared.</text>

I'm not American, but frequency doesn't matter in determining if you need gun or not. And there is potential for very violent road rage always and everywhere.</text>
