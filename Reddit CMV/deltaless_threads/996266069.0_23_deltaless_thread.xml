    <title>CMV: There is no reason a “God” should give Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>Protagoras67</original_poster>
    <original_post>I want to disclose that I am both an atheist and a hard determinist. I do not believe in any sort of creator and I have a hard time believing in Free Will. From what I understand from a Christian perspective, God gives humans free will in an effort to test them. But what i don’t understand from their point of view is why would God do that in the first place? Isn’t God omnipotent? God could just design the universe however it wants, we could have all been programmed to behave a certain way from birth and believe in God from birth and follow one religion as opposed to having a myriad of them. There is no reason to test us, it’s completely unnecessary.

Again, I’m not challenging anyone to prove God exists, I am just trying to understand the theological logic of this.</original_post>

I'm fully aware that Mormons are nutty, but their ideology is at least internally consistent, unlike most more vanilla brands of Christianity. Their claim is that the purpose of this test is to see who is worthy to achieve God-like powers of their own, and eventually become God to another universe.

To Mormons, no. To Niceaen Catholics, yes.

Mormons believe that God did not "create" the universe so much as "organize" it (which is also a Kabbalahic Jewish tradition). "Intelligence" also exists outside of God's creation and is what gives us free will. God's testing is what separates the good intelligences from the bad, and he rewards the good with more power, a la the parable of the talents. 

I'm aware that's even more bizarre than standard Magic Sky Man beliefs, but it does at least answer your question as to why God behaves the way he does in a manner that is internally consistent and logical (if you accept the starting batshit axioms).</text>
