    <title>CMV: Nicotine is not, alone, more addictive than caffeine.</title>
    <original_poster>blubugeye</original_poster>
    <original_post>Nicotine is widely claimed to be highly addictive, but it is quite difficult to find studies of nicotine in isolation.  Studies found through web searches address nicotine in cigarette smoke.  Cigarette smoke is known to include many chemicals that may significantly influence the effects of nicotine.  In fact, it is difficult to determine whether elements of cigarette smoke make nicotine more addictive, as opposed to nicotine enhancing the effects of other chemicals and therefore appearing to be addictive while actually enhancing in a different experience.

Meanwhile, nicotine is available "over the counter" (albeit with restrictions) in the form of nicotine gum or nicotine in "vape juice."  Addiction to nicotine gum (in non-smokers) does not appear to be an issue.

I have never smoked, but I have taken up vaping.  After months of exposure, I find that I miss my vaping no more than I miss my morning coffee.

**EDIT**

I have found [an article that is pertinent](http://discovermagazine.com/2014/march/13-nicotine-fix), published by Discover Magazine.  To my point: "Perhaps most surprising is that, in studies by Boyd and others, nicotine has not caused addiction or withdrawal when used to treat disease," and "it’s almost impossible to get laboratory animals hooked on pure nicotine, though it has a mildly pleasant effect."

I now have leads that I can follow through the researchers named in the article.

    <text>Why does nicotine gum show a significant therapeutic effect for people suffering withdrawal symptoms from quitting smoking? I phrased this as neutrally as possible and I really want you to tell me why you think, if nicotine is not very addictive, nicotine *gum* is so effective at treating smoking withdrawal.</text>

    <text>It is not clear that it does show a significant effect.  From [Nicotine replacement therapy for long‐term smoking cessation: a meta‐analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2563611/):
&amp;gt; The addition of NRT to the brief advice or behavioural support offered in the included studies gave an odds ratio of 2 and represents a 70–90% increase in the cessation rate achieved without NRT. However, since the long‐term success rate without NRT is extremely modest, these figures disguise the true overall impact of NRT which is similarly modest and represents success for only about 7% of all those treated in these trials.

My paraphrase: NRT is better than nothing, but it's hardly a game-changer.</text>

    <text>Your paraphrase is dishonest - NRT is *almost twice as effective* as the alternatives.</text>

    <text>&amp;gt; dishonest

It is entirely honest.  "Success for only about 7%" is "almost twice as effective" as success for only 4%.  Neither is at all impressive.  I honestly think and feel this.</text>
