    <title>CMV: Astrology is nonsensical.</title>
    <original_poster>GSGhostTrain</original_poster>
    <original_post>To head off some initial arguments, I want to be clear that I understand many, many people engage in astrology as a sort of fun "horoscope only" type of activity. That's fine, and I don't begrudge anyone that. However, having encountered some people who buy further into it, including star charts for significant others being required, or making decisions based on astrological positions, I have always struggled to understand this belief. 

To date, I have never heard an explanation of *why* the position of the stars and planets would have any bearing on mood, personality, behavior, or anything else beyond potentially the weather -- only what the supposed effects *are*. I would like to better understand what the supposed causal chain is between the positioning of the planets and verifiable outcomes.</original_post>

    <text>The only thing I can think of is correlation between sun signs/month of birth and personalities. I can't cite any studies off hand, but I remember someone making the claim that Pisces are more often bipolar, or something.

There's also personal experience, which is not very different, if at all, from superstition. I've noticed that relationships with Sagittarians almost never end well. They seem nice at first, then we grate on eachother, then they show their crazy sides.

As for more than sun signs, I can't say. In any magical tradition planets will have correspondences,  but much of these traditions are about metaphorical significance of things in general.

I guess a belief in a difficult to define cosmic order brings a sense of comfort to people who want to belong, without the baggage of traditional religion, or the responsibility of true spirituality.</text>
