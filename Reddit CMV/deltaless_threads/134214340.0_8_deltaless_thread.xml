    <title>CMV: I Believe a Sustainable Market for Video Games Oriented Towards Women Exists, and that Feminism Would Be Better Served to Develop For It Than Merely Complain About It</title>
    <original_poster>OhCrapADinosaur</original_poster>
    <original_post>E3 took place the past couple of days, and of the various bits of news from the event, Ubisoft announced their Assassin's Creed title. I'm wholly indifferent to the Assassin's Creed games, but apparently this game features 4 person local multiplayer and only includes a slate of male characters. As a result of this news, some of my feminist former-friends posted articles to this effect: http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/11/5799386/no-female-characters-in-assassins-creed-unity-too-much-work

I'm not going to weigh in on the truth of Ubisoft's claims particularly, whether or not their claims were justified, or whether any of the views held by either side is right and just. The general consensus among the feminism crowd seemed to be along the lines that:

* 1. There are many sexist stereotypes prevalent in video games, possibly moreso in mainstream titles, and particularly noticed (by the feminists) are those stereotypes concerning women.
* 2. There is a large and substantial base of female gamers, many of whom would presumably enjoy games that break stereotypes and employ strong female lead characters
* 3. Many popular games today don't necessarily serve female gamers so well

I'm not going to suggest that feminists shouldn't complain (well, I might a little), but from my vantage point that's pretty much all I see get done. If you actually believe 1, 2, and 3 above, then there might be a GOLDEN MARKET OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU and you should invest your ranting energy into developing for this female gamer market (it's also overwhelmingly likely that this is, in fact, already being done and I'm just not particularly aware of it). Barriers to entry have probably never been lower to go develop for almost any platform you like, and indy games that hit it big have the opportunity to hit it REALLY big. You could make the video game equivalent of "Orange is the New Black" and have millions of loving, adoring fans who will cheer and talk about how you helped bring women into the video game mainstream. And hey, money!

Sadly, this attitude didn't much win over my feminist friends, who more or less told me to shut up and go fuck myself. So... yeah, I fail to see the problem with my thinking. Anybody want to help me out?

    <text>Games that avoid sexist stereotypes are not games "made for women". Avoiding such tropes will make for better games, and would avoid creating negative stereotypes in the agent population (young boys).

Now that doesn't mean that every game needs to be toeing the line of political correctness. But the prevalence of unthinking and lazy stereotypes and tropes is harming gaming *as a whole*.

**Feminism** is about eliminating the negative stereotypes and harmful attitudes in general. Creating a segregated market where "boy" games can be as misogynist and insensitive as they want and "girl" games care about correcting those tropes **misses the point entirely.**</text>

    <text>Why does avoiding one trope or another make a video game better? Sexist and racist themes pervade gaming from GTA style games all the way to World of Warcraft with their character attributes. </text>

    <text>Character attributes aren't sexist, they're based on biology (fictional or otherwise). </text>

    <text>Avoiding lazy development tropes will lead to better characters and plotlines. Developers use sexist tropes as a *replacement* for quality writing and character designs. By calling this out, you not only help to fight the stereotypes themselves, but promote quality writing. 

For instance, many female characters have almost no character in games. They are a bust and ass. By calling this trope out and calling on developers to do better, gamers will be presented with more interesting, varied and human characters.

Likewise, by calling out the 'damsel in distress' trope, you challenge story-writers to come up with compelling motivations for their stories and characters. If you just accept these, you are giving developers a pass for their laziness. </text>
