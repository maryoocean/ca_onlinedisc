    <title>CMV: Fredom of speech is far more important than a few people being offended</title>

    <original_post>Freedom of speech should be protected and kept, there shouldn't be people arrested for anti trans comments or insulting a soldier/soldiers, or for nazi jokes, or racist remarks or jokes.

Those should all be handled between people, if someone says stuff you dont like you handle it, simply block them or avoid them, theres a whole world you can be in and that persons in a very tiny part of it. 

It makes me nervous seeing people arrested and charged for saying things. It's only leading us to a place where we can be arrested for saying whatever the government doesnt like. And they shouldn't be in that much power to effect our communication with eachother. 

I live in scotland and dont feel I have freedom of speech anymore. 

(For the record I'm a white woman who's bi and have trans thoughts ig for those folks who say it never has been about me, it has sometimes, and in more ways than just those)

Edit: No it's not just anti trans people, Yes I believe crimes other than hate crimes involving speech should be illegal (threatening violence, doxing, defamation) but I also believe insults, jokes and bad takes or thoughts should not be.

Edit 2: Consequences for what is said like losing a job, getting insulted, losing friends ect is totally fine I just dont think the Government should be in charge of what can get you arrested in this sence.

Edit 3: I live in SCOTLAND in the UNITED KINGDOM or in BRITAIN depending what you say, I'm not american, im also not here advocating for my right to be a dick, im just saying the government arent the ones I want saying what I cant say, I mean twitter can destroy lives without them anyway.</original_post>

    <text>What's offensive is fundamentally a very personal, subjective, and fluid feeling.  It's 100% up to the individual as to its impact on them and how they react to others "speech".  

That being said society also develops a societal standard of behavior norms that may include words and symbols that may generate widespread consternation.  I personally believe that government should NEVER police peoples thoughts or feelings and therefore should NEVER make ideas illegal to hold or share.

What complicates the matter is there are things like libel, slander, threatening words, etc. that start to blur that line between sharing an idea and actually causing harm.  In the US the law generally does a pretty good job of sorting that stuff out.  

I think society would be better if we focussed on people dealing with their own insecurities and triggers rather than trying to get people to conform to an arbitrary idea of what's acceptable vs offensive. Who get's to decide what's offensive enough to restrict? 

I only trust myself to determine how to react to other people.

It's much better (and more practical) to teach kids to ignore/discount offensive speech than it is to restrict any freedom of speech. I think it's dangerous to *punitively* punish any speech (like losing jobs, restricting social media access, etc. except in very practical circumstances like a public figure who's image is part of the job).</text>
