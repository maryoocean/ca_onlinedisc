    <title>CMV: Customer service sucks</title>
    <original_poster>comeandgetsome30</original_poster>
    <original_post>I know this is a broad generalization, but holy hell, I remember a time when I'd walk up to a counter and not be met with someone who would just stare at me until I initiated interaction. I know life sucks, but geeze, try just a smidge to be kind to those who aren't actively f*cking you. The problem seems to be ubiquitous, whether on the phone or in person. People seem disenfranchised, and with good reason, however this negative attitude just spreads like a contagious bug. 

I know this is subjective. For those who are old enough to compare times, I wonder if there isn't anyone who doesn't share this opinion. For those who aren't, I feel pity if this is your normal.</original_post>

    <text>Depends on where you go. I go to Publix next door that pays pretty well. Everyone there is nice, clean and friendly. My wife made me go to a Wal Mart today. Was a bunch shitbirds working there. They don't pay particularly well. But it's a lot cheaper too.

Part of the reason you pay extra in Publix is because it's cleaner,  higher quality products and higher quality staff. You get what you pay for in the end.</text>
