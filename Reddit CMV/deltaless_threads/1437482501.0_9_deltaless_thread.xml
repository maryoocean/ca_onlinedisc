    <title>CMV: Kink and BDSM should not be at public pride events and should be kept for 18+ ones</title>
    <original_poster>akoudagawaismywaifu</original_poster>
    <original_post>To start, I am a lesbian. And I've been seeing recent controversy about this topic. 

Look, no denying that kink plays a big role in the creation of pride. It is a part of embracing sexuality and shouldn't be excluded from the community. 

However, it should not be at public pride parades. Pride should be for everyone of all ages. Many people say "stop catering to the straight capitalized ideal of what pride should be" and "pride isn't a party, it's a protest don't police us" and "children should go to disney if they want family friendly" This has nothing to do with straight rainbow capitalism. I figured out I was LGBT at age 11 and trust me if I saw a kink act in public I would be kind of disgusted. I'm still a minor now, and I'd be less disgusted but still. I know people say that it's up to you to bring your children to pride, but by making all pride events "wear whatever you want even if it's nothing" we are also kinda excluding minors from it. It's also non consensual to anyone who is exposed to such acts, because nobody wants to go to pride to see naked people right? The "think of the children" phrase holds true here. Young children and teens embracing their sexuality shouldn't be forced to see adult acts against their will. 

Again, no denying the role kink plays in the community, but it should be kept at 18+ events. There should definitely be a separate pride for people who just want to do leather and other kinks. That way, you can do whatever you want in a safe space where you know you won't offend others, and because people consented to come to an 18+ event, it's all good. 

That's just my personal opinion on it, but it seems to be the minority. I'd like to see how you guys think about this.

Edit: it appears after reading and responding to several comments, I don't really have a problem with kink, but more with public indecency. I don't care if you wear a collar or leather pants. But I'd rather not see things that could get you arrested or questioned for doing in public.</original_post>

    <text>Just don’t go if it makes you personally uncomfortable. 

It does not take away from your identity to not go to public pride events. 

Forcing someone else to not participate is not inclusive to everyone. 

It is quite the opposite in actuality, you are asking someone not to participate.</text>

    <text>That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. It's exclusive to hardcore kinksters to keep it family friendly for children? Hardcore kinksters can put on some clothes, enjoy a day outside with other people, then go home to their dungeons and do whatever they want in private. Or, join a group dedicated to it if that's what they need. That's not excluding them, it's just asking them to have some humility and respect toward minors.

It's a whole lot fucking easier for a leatherhead to put on respectable, yet still prideful, clothing, than it is to expect and demand all children present be at the same level of sexual awareness and also expect everyone at the event to auto-provide unspoken consent.</text>

    <text>So kinksters can come to pride as long as they are heteronormative passing?  


Yeah thats not gunna fly. Sorry  


If people can wear hot pants or a jock strap or whatever, then some guys can wear a puppy mask</text>

    <text>Who said anything about being heteronormative? Its just being decent human. Having decency to not walk out on the parade barely clothed while having a 10 inch dildo up your ass. Im a fag and i dont eant to see that shit in public.</text>

  <comment id="37038726795.0" user="WitheredBarry" delta="False">
    <text>Most everyone who doesn't want kink at pride doesn't want *any* kink at pride. They would rather it be a respectful, decent event that anyone of any age and sensitivity can participate in. Many of them see the Civil Rights marches of the past with immense respect, and wish other progressive movements could stand with the same solidarity: our message is what's important, more than anything else. 

There's no winning with this argument because one person's expectation will never match another's. People have different boundaries. All this ever becomes is a circle jerk and mortaring between people with different values.</text>

    <text>Your use of the word heteronormative to imply that straight people don’t enjoy these kinds of acts is regressive and discriminatory. You seem to be saying that straight people who participate in such acts are not normal, an extremely troubling point of view for someone who claims to be concerned with enabling people to be proud of their sexual identity.</text>

    <text>Questioning public indecency ≠ asking not to participate. 

I will still go to pride, thank you. As many in the comments say, it seems to depend on where you are. If it's something like leather boots or a collar, I don't really care.</text>

    <text>Hi /u/Psychological_Map296,

**Your recent conduct in r/changemyview is unacceptable, and severely violates the rules.** Please be aware of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/modstandards#wiki_disrupting_the_subreddit) provision of the [Mod Standards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/modstandards), which *permits emergency bans in situations that threaten subreddit integrity.*

In lieu of a ban, however, I have judged that your conduct *does not* reach the threshold for such immediate actions. 

However, **consider this message a final warning**. 

Please do the following:

1. **Do not continue the violative behavior.** Cease any behavior or conduct that violates the rules of r/changemyview.

2. **Step away from the keyboard IRL.** Recent behavior that you've exhibited in r/changemyview indicates that you may benefit from taking a break from Reddit and self-reflecting on your recent interactions. 

3. [**Remember the human.**](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)

We hope that future experiences you have in our sub are positive. However, we are concerned about your recent conduct, and please request that you be more considerate of the rules going forward. 

For your information, **we have made a note of this incident in our records.**</text>
