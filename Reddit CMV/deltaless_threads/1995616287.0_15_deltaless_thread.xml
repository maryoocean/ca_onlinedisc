    <title>CMV:Germany could not win WW2</title>
    <original_poster>Niberus</original_poster>
    <original_post>I’ve often heard that if Germany did something different one way or another then they could have won WW2 however, I'd argue that they had no chance to win no matter what they would have done (a realistic way that is). 

From attacking the French and English in the west, to trying to subjugate various countries in the Balkans to having the brilliant idea of invading the Soviet Union, the Germans just kept making the war harder for themselves whilst making their goals further and further unreachable as the war staggered on and they were eventually chased all the way back to Berlin.

Not exactly sure what was going through Hitler’s brain at the time or when he ended his life in the Fuhrer bunker though I have to imagine that whatever mistakes he might have wanted to avoid at various points of the war it would still have ended terribly for them.

From the Allies having the control of most of the world’s resources, to the Soviet Union being too big of a block to try and knock down, to the unstable and unreliable allies that Germany had on its side, to the ideological zeal that prevented many alliances that could have taken place simply vanishing into the wind, to the massive industrial output being underestimated by the axis, to the poor planning of certain plans, to the various manpower issues that Germany suffered from, to the poor prioritization in subjecting various “””subhuman””” (their words not mine) cultures or deficiencies of human beings rather than building more war material.

Another issue is that time was simply not on Germany’s side due to all the continuing escalations that were occurring from the Japanese and Italians that various other powers were going to be fighting Germany regardless thereby tipping the scales even if the Germans wanted to keep the war on a small scale. While I won’t say that the Americans or Soviets would inevitably join if the Germans decided to draw the war out, it certainly didn’t look positive for them either. Secondly the British simply wouldn’t have fallen or settled for a white peace as they had the industry and manpower to fight on and had a superior air force to begin bombing Germany itself during nighttime. The Soviets had the manpower and industry to fight on and a massive distance between the German army and the relocated industry in the Urals. And the Americans? Well they had so much that they could sustain a war on two front against two major enemies that Germany itself could only have dreamed of either from the First World War or from the Second World War that they ended up losing anyway.

With all of this in mind, I just do not see a (rational and realistic) way in which the Germans could win. Everything was against them from the very beginning in the invasion of the Second Polish Republic to the scorching deserts of North Africa, to the hellscape of Far Eastern Europe to the collapse of the Reich itself. 

Would be welcome to changing my mind…</original_post>

    <text>When you say (rational and realistic), you're limiting the possibilities to what YOU perceive as plausible, even if events in history have been stranger and more outrageous than your standards. But honestly I think your view on this is reliant on standards for reality that haven't been articulated, which means no one can debate it based on a specific situation.  


 It's like trying to debate the outcome of a chess game between two AI that are beyond the level of the human mind, when little to no pieces have been moved yet. I think you should be more specific stating what date you think the war became unwinnable for Germany, and the reasons why.</text>

When Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 that's exactly when they lost. They started a war that they had no chance at winning.

If you have counterarguments I'll be interested in seeing them</text>

    <text>That's an awfully dogmatic statement. I think their greatest mistake was the attack of Russia. The war with Russia drained so much of their time, money, and men unnecessarily. They were always going to attack Russia, but why do it while in fierce battle with the west? I think that if they focused their power on defeating England they could maybe be neutral with U.S (isolationist sentiments were at a high) while establishing puppet governments in the European countries.  Keep in mind EIGHTY PERCENT of all German military casualties were from fighting Russia. They gave England a run for their money the first time at Normandy and could've solidified victory if they kept applying pressure in that direction.</text>

    <text>Unfortunately the Battle of Britain and the war in the Atlantic was powered by the one element that Germany found lacking. Oil. While there was enough in Romania to keep the war going until September/October 1941, after that point they would find themselves either having to find oil elsewhere (attacking USSR and taking the vast oil fields of Caucasia) or downgrade/scale back operations to save fuel for the previous deficit.

And while it's worthwhile to note that Germany wouldn't have attacked America anytime soon, the Japanese were going to destroy American isolationism due to the oil deficit that they faced after America embargoed oil exports to Japan and so America would have joined the Allies and attacked Germany regardless.</text>
