    <title>CMV: Its easier to make a dog's death emotional than a humans death in movies</title>

    <original_post>So in movies it's pretty hard to make an audience emotional. I barely ever get emotional at humans deaths but when a dog dies I feel sad. I thought about it and I realized something. So one of the main things required to make a death scene emotional is to make the audience attached to the person or dog. And in the average 1 hour 30 minute to 2 hour run time it's hard to make the audience attached to characters at an emotional level. Here's where the dog has a distinct advantage with first impressions. When you walk down the street and a see a random person unless he is doing something that you like/dislike you tend to just think "that a guy/girl, that's a human" or other minor things. When you see a dog most people tend to think "awe he/she is cute or what a good boy/girl!" It's much easier to get attached to a dog than a person. Also another thing dogs have over humans is we tend to need to relate to humans in order to like them on an emotional level. For example if some one made a really nice and heroic character in a movies at first we would like him but since we ourselves tend not to be heroic and nice all the time we can't relate. Making a good human character like that is really hard because you need to have really good characteristics to make him likable but also a flaw that makes him relatable.  However we don't need to relate with dogs to love them we don't have much in common with dogs yet we still love them to death. In conclusion if you won't to make me cry from a movie death a dog is probably a better option.</original_post>

    <text>Perhaps in the same way that it's easier for a horror movie to scare the audience with an unearned jump scare. Or, to stretch the analogy a bit, if a comedian made the audience laugh by running into the crowd and tickling people. But neither of those things are really that impactful, because they just rely on cheap tricks that exploit the way we respond to certain things.

The most emotionally impactful deaths, at least in my experience, were mostly from human characters. It definitely is more difficult to build up a character that we can get really attached to, but it also has a much greater payoff. Those are the characters that stay with you for days after you've watched the movie. Whereas if I see a (non-anthropomorphized) dog or animal death, I'm usually just sad for a few moments before I move on.</text>
