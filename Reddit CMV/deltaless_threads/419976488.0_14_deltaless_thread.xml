    <title>CMV: Municipalities should not hold easily politicized elections for apolitical positions like sheriff.</title>

    <original_post>I see a lot about sheriffs being appointed through local elections, even seeing people wearing tshirts that say "Re-elect [sheriff's name] for [county name] county sheriff". But to me that seems to politicize a position that is one of considerable power to enforce the law in the area. By politicizing that, a sheriff is able to impose a political agenda to the point where it is literally able to be enforced at gunpoint, and can appoint deputies that align with them. While it makes towns essentially an absolute in terms of political alignment, it also insulates them to changes going on around them, including in surrounding towns or cities, and ultimately stifles progress and lets them get away with things that regular public officials wouldn't get away with because they are essentially their own oversight committee, like we saw with Joe Arpaio.</original_post>

    <text>In Canada we don't have elected positions for police chiefs or judges or justices (federal level judges). So it can work to have a society where this doesn't happen. However, there are concerns here about people being appointed who shouldn't be. I think unfortunately there are good and bad points to electing versus appointing. Maybe there is a way that these systems can be blended. This could allow for the benefits of both to be brought in </text>
