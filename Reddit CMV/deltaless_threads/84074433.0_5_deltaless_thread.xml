    <title>I believe real Christians died out centuries ago, CMV.</title>

    <original_post>That is to say, if real Christians ever existed in the first place. If you are a Christian, you must follow the teachings of the bible. You must follow the teachings of Christ. A real follower of any religion should follow that religion, not pick and choose what bits interest them. As soon as you can say "this works" and "this doesn't", you're not following the rules!

I believe anyone who works on the Sabbath, has piercings or tattoos, wears cotton/polyester blends, has a same-sex relationship, allows a woman to teach, or allows a woman to speak in church, etc. And says they're a Christian is lying.

I am certainly not saying that anyone should actually follow these rules, but I am convinced you are simply being dishonest if you call yourself a Christian, or a member of any religion, without following the rules that were clearly put out to you under that religion. Anyone that chooses to nit-pick the parts of their religion that they choose to follow is nothing more than a deist with a book they like. You are not a follower unless you are a follower!

Update: Between /u/TheophilusOmega and /u/Ausfall my view has changed. I feel the easiest way for me to word this is my analogy that the Bible is not a rulebook to Christians, but a textbook. They don't follow it to a T because they don't have to. Jesus' teachings is the lesson, and the Bible is the textbook in which his teachings and the Biblical historical relevance is told. Assuming that a Christian must follow the rules of the Bible exactly, else they are not a 'true' believer, is fallacious reasoning as shown by /u/ausfall, and between the two of them I've learned what actually separates following the Holy Book to following the Religion itself. I feel the points were put across strongest and clearest by these two Redditors, but thank you to everyone else who contributed.</original_post>

    <text>Not following the rules is a sin. But bro, just because we sin, does not mean we are not Christian. One of Jesus' greatest disciples was Peter. However, Peter actually betrayed the Lord three times. Still, he was a Christian and blessed by God. </text>

    <text>But why would you pretend to espouse a belief when you openly and without remorse flout it? 

What is the value of a book, which purports to be *the* way for living life, if it should not be followed absolutely? 

The stakes are very fucking high when it comes to Christianity. That religion purports to have the answer for *all of eternity.* If someone truly believed that was the case, they should be in a monastery their whole life praying away. It's not some casual thing to fuck around with. And yet that's how most people act about it. </text>

    <text>What Christians do *not* believe is that it is possible to live without sin.</text>

    <text>It's impossible for a human being to live without sin, the only reason Jesus was able to was because he was quite literally God and so he was the only perfect one. Also the reason why he was able to sacrifice himself for the sins of all people</text>

    <text>No. Jesus does not want us to stay in a monastery our entire life just praising him. He wants us to be a light on a hill that preaches the good news to all the world. He wants us to live among the world and with the world. I would love to talk to you more about the bible and what he teaches. Just PM me anytime!</text>
