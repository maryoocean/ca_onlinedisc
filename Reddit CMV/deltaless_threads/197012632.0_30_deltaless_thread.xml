    <title>CMV: Bernie Sanders idea of free college doesn't seem like a good thing.</title>
    <original_poster>mbeogoa</original_poster>
    <original_post>This is probably because I am really bad at understanding politics and don't totally know what Sanders wants to do.  

But the money for free college would come from taxes, correct?  Does that mean that taxes would get raised or that he would just alter around the spending the government does?  Because if taxes are going to get raised that means I have to pay for my own loans that are going to take 10 years plus extra taxes so people can go for free?  That is not fair and while it seems nice, I don't have the money for that.  Nor, I'm sure, do most Americans.  

And what happens with private institutions?  Does that mean through my taxes I am paying for someone to go a $60,000 school when I couldn't go to one myself because I couldn't afford it?  Maybe that seems selfish, but that does not seem fair.  And the government should not be able to force me to pay so other people can get an easier life when I myself did not get that chance.  By the way, I know I am already being forced to pay for things I don't want, but shouldn't we be trying to lessen those instances instead of adding to them?

I mean, on paper his idea sounds great.  Free college, a better educated America, a more economically even country. YAY.  But that doesn't come for free.  And just because I am finally out of school and making a semi-decent wage doesn't mean I should have to pay for other people.  I guess that means I am anti-socialism?  Is there maybe any other way that this could be accomplished?  Like just lessening the cost of college somehow instead of totally free?

    <text>I'm going to only talk about you response to it not being fair. First you are right it's not fair to you. However, it's not a matter of doing what's fair to the previous generation it's about creating a better society for the next one. If we were always concerned about making sure this generation has just as much opportunity as the next nothing would change.  Lets take public schools (k-12) as an example. I'm sure you are grateful that either you or underprivileged kids all were able to go to public schools for free. But once upon a time when this was first proposed you had an entire generation that was robbed of free education because they were born too early. And to them it was not fair the these new kids got to go to school for free. But it's better for society as a whole even if it wasn't "fair". "Fairness" to you because you had a harder time, or needed to spend more money should not be the determining factor to a political system, instead it should be what is the best for society.  </text>
