    <title>CMV:I believe torture to be perfectly ok if guilt is established beyond reasonable doubt.</title>
    <original_poster>Disgustingoldslob</original_poster>
    <original_post>Simple as the title, I believe that if someone is guilty of a serious crime against another (rape, murder, child abuse, etcetc) the victim or the family of the victim should be legally allowed to torture the guilty party as part of the punishment. I do not believe doing so lowers you to the level of the guilty, as you would be acting out violence on someone who harmed an innocent, while they were completely unjustified in their actions. I also do not believe the moral objections of others should interfere with the legal right of the family/victim.

Edit for clarification, I don't believe it should be mandatory, but I believe it should be an available option. I'm speaking of cases in which guilt is almost perfectly assured. (e.g sound witness testimony, DNA, caught in the act, admission of guilt, etc.)

    <text>I don't really agree, on the same principle why I'm not generally in favor of smacking a kid to teach them a lesson.

In our justice system, we don't really have an analogue for physical punishment or retribution.

we have:

a)  Jailtime (timeout &amp;amp; loss of priviledges)

b)  Fines (loss of toys or allowance)

c)  Community Service (extra chores)

d) and parole (being grounded, related to A)

The Death Penalty is the closest thing we have (in North American society) to a physical punishment.

I'm not a fan of spanking in general because that's not part of the toolset society uses to reprimand citizens.  And in that same way, allowing the family to physically torture the guilty party goes against that as well.

Additionally, I think most people would come to regret the pain they inflicted and it would give them long term emotional trauma.</text>
