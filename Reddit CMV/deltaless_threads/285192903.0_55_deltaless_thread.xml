    <title>CMV: Hillary Clinton is unfit for presidency.</title>
    <original_poster>Professorjack88</original_poster>
    <original_post>I believe that Hillary Clinton is unfit for the presidency because she is corrupt, a liar, and a hypocrite.

1. Hillary Clinton is corrupt. She or her husband routinely [have taken money from companies](http://downtrend.com/robertgehl/oops-bill-clinton-says-he-accidentally-took-500000-from-algeria-during-key-arms-negotiation-with-state-department), that they then go on to give government contracts. [One of her largest donors was given a spot on the nuclear advisory board, with no experience at all.](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/clinton-had-donor-as-nuclear-security-adviser.html) She will not release her speech transcripts, which hints at the fact that Hillary may have told them something that she doesn't want to get out. Whether it be corruption or something else; she is hiding something.



2. Hillary Clinton is a hypocrite and a liar. She takes huge sums of cash from wall street, and then says that she is going to breakup the banks. She says that she is a women's rights activist, and yet takes millions from countries like Saudi Arabia. I haven't even mentioned Hillary's flip flopping on all sorts of her campaign issues, and described in [this](http://imgur.com/Ls3B6n1) image. You can see her whole platform change in response to Bernie Sanders. She seems to say anything to get elected.

Based on all this, how can people support her? The facts are right there, and yet Hillary continues to get many votes. Is there something that I'm missing? It seems as if the second she gets in office she will support the big donors that she has pledged against. Throughout this whole thing, I haven't yet talked about Hillary's email scandal. She held secret government files on a server that was *hacked multiple times.* If someone could show me the reasons to support Hillary that would be great.

    <text>The Clinton Foundation accepts contributions from various sources but the money goes towards charitable activities, not into the Clintons' pockets. There's no evidence she's done official favors for donors. She's gotten paid for speeches after leaving office, but so do lots of politicians. Her paid speeches are mostly innocuous feel-good blather, she's under no obligation to release transcripts but if she did, do you really expect to find any earth-shattering revelations? She's never called for breaking up the banks, but supports other reforms of our financial system. Regarding the emails, she broke administrative  rules but no criminal laws, unless she knowingly revealed classified info to unauthorized people, which she did not. Has she lied? Of course, but she's actually more honest than most politicians. Read this: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/hillary-clinton-honest-transparency-jill-abramson. And sure, she's guilty of hypocrisy, but who isn't? If you disagree with her policies fine, but don't accuse her of corruption without evidence.</text>
