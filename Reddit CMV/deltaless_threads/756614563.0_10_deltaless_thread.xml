    <title>CMV: It should be illegal to have a pitbull that isn't spayed or neutered</title>

    <original_post>Should be self-explanatory. I don't think we should straight up ban the breed, but getting such a dog fixed should be a legal requirement for owning one. Un-neutered dogs are \[responsible for the vast majority of serious attacks\]([https://www.avma.org/Advocacy/StateAndLocal/Pages/dogbite-summary.aspx](https://www.avma.org/Advocacy/StateAndLocal/Pages/dogbite-summary.aspx)) according to the AVMA. This would also result in a pit bull population decline which would reduce the huge number of pits clogging up shelters.</original_post>

    <text>Where does your policy stop? I mean, most people don't even know an actual pitbull when they see one. The American Pitbull Terrier is the only *actual* pitbull in existence and most lay people would never guess that's the pitbull in a lineup. 

Instead, the label of pitbull gets slapped on to almost anything: dogos, cane corsos, staffordshires, filas, boerboels, curs, american bulldogs, blueblood bulldogs, catahoulas...the list goes on. Even boxers. Are you going to demand the same of all of those breeds as well? Is any dog or dog breed that some ignoramous can point to and cry 'pitbull'! going to fall under the same policy?

For an idea of how people often can't spot the actual pit, here's a quiz:
