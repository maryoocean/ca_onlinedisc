    <title>CMV: Picky eaters deserve more respect and shouldn’t be shamed for being picky</title>
    <original_poster>UsualMorning98</original_poster>
    <original_post>It’s not always the picky eater’s fault they’re picky. It could be due to how they were raised (not their fault), trauma or sensory issues with food (something that can be really hard to work through) and many other factors.

A lot of them either try their best to make things easier for “regular” eaters (bringing their own food to events, looking at the menu beforehand, ordering from the kid’s menu, simply not eating that meal/day etc) or feel extreme guilt when they can’t accommodate to those who will shame them.

I’m not saying they should be prioritised over people with allergies or those with other food needs (like vegetarians or those who don’t eat certain foods for religious reasons). But they deserve a little more respect and support because it’s also hard for them being picky eaters. Definitely prioritise food issues that could harm someone. But once that’s sorted, don’t get mad at the picky eaters for just trying to exist.</original_post>

    <text>There are things that are valid and other things than any adult has had plenty of time to learn to cope with.

Spicy food isn’t so easy to overcome aversion to.  It can ruin the whole experience of eating it and cause literal pain that can last for hours after eating.  So if a group gets food for a party and only gets super hot hot wings, they are being jerks if someone in the group doesn’t like spicy food. At most traditionally spicy restaurants they will have mild options.  Wings with a honey barbecue, or a Indian restaurant with dishes that have no heat at all.

But people who refuse to go to even an Americanized Chinese buffet because they don’t like Chinese, yet the buffet has sweet and sour chicken that you can get without the sauce which is basically chicken nuggets, or various other items that literally have nothing to do with Chinese cuisine, then they are just being overly picky and need to grow up.</text>
