    <title>I believe anti-depressants change who you are as a person rather than fix you to the way you should be. CMV.</title>

I've taken anti-depressants before, but I don't feel like they made my brain work the way it's 'supposed' to. I think however my brain works naturally, without the use of medications, is its REAL natural state.

When I took anti-depressants, it changed the way I looked at the people in my life, the way I see how things work, even some of my opinions! I didn't feel like the ME I've been my whole life. But when I went off again, though I was depressed, I felt like myself again.

Since this experience, I've been unable to believe that depressants make you the way you're SUPPOSED to be. I feel that your natural state is acquired without the use of any medications. I'm a little old fashioned I suppose. Change my vieeeew?

    <text>It's not that they fix you to the way you should be, it's that they put you in a healthier mental state than you're in without the medicine. Severe depression can really ruin people's lives if they don't get help for it. </text>
