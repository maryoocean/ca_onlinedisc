    <title>cmv: Canada should install dirty atomic bombs in each big lake as an invasion deterrent.</title>
    <original_poster>maxi1134</original_poster>
    <original_post>With the upcoming climate changes and the fact that Canada has 20% of the freshwater reserve in the world. Russia, America, and other states might have an interest in invading Canada to access the water reserves and the Canadian north that will taw out and become available for crops.    
  

With this information, I believe that rigging the water table to be radioactive for eons in case of invasion would be the perfect deterrent to prevent the invasion from any other state.   

  

Especially America, as their water table would then also be contaminated</original_post>

    <text>Moving large quantities of water around vast distances costs more energy than desalination does. It's only viable when the elevation stays relatively flat, or goes down.

Russia already has the biggest freshwater lake in the world with 20% of the water. And shipping water by tanker sounds incredibly expensive anyway. 

The US has fresh water sources much closer to home and at higher elevations, like the Great Lakes or Mississippi River, both of which are too far away from LA to divert water to. So Canada is out of the question.

There's just zero reason for anyone to want Canada's water.</text>
