    <title>CMV: Catholic views of sexual morality are not homophobic</title>
    <original_poster>forgivememia</original_poster>
    <original_post>The Catholic position is this: in order to be moral, sexual acts must be (1) marital, (2) unitive and (3) open to life. 

Homosexual acts are by definition *NOT* open to life, and therefore they are seen as immoral. They are a sin. All heterosexual acts outside of marriage (which most people are guilty of) are *equally* immoral, and also considered a sin. 

This means that the people who engage in these acts are sinners. But *everybody* is a sinner. There's no belief that sinners are by definition 'evil'. Catholics think that homosexual acts are immoral, but we do not hate the people who commit them, and we do not think that homosexuals are evil. 

If you believe that your friend swears too much, or behaves selfishly, you disapprove of these behaviours, but you don't have to hate your friend.

    <text>You are talking about an aversion to homosexual acts. It doesn't matter what your opinions of homophobic individuals are. The aversion to homosexual acts constitutes homophobia. The fact that it's mandated by religion doesn't make it not homophobic, since religion can be homophobic.

On a slightly unrelated note, you've been saying a few times that your stance against homosexuality is reasonable because it's a religious position. But religious positions can be unreasonable, so this is irrelevant. </text>
