    <title>CMV: High school literature and history courses fail to provide meaningful educational value</title>
    <original_poster>dabears_24</original_poster>
    <original_post>In their current form, high school courses focused on history and literature fail to provide meaningful educational benefits. 

These classes commonly have a goal of improving critical thinking skills and develop advanced literacy. However, the format of current history courses where students heavily analyze past events, does not emphasize critical thinking, but rather focuses on memorization of history that has little to no significance in the present. Literature classes that focus on deep analysis of *important* texts like Shakespeare's works, complex poetry, or stylistic writing (i.e. stream-of-consciousness in "Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man") do not develop readinc/writing skills applicable to students' lives or modern texts. They also tend to foster dislike for reading when students are forced to extract meaning from texts they do not value or understand.

I believe a courses in debate, critical analysis of nonfiction works (i.e. argumentative opinion pieces), or even literary analysis of more familiar works would all be better alternatives to detailed US history or general literature courses.

Since this is a broad statement with caveats, I'll clarify in a list:

- I am not arguing the classes offer zero value. The concept of being in an educational environment likely has benefits itself, so my view will not be changed by arguments of the form "all education has value".


- I acknowledge the value of basic history lessons in understand society, culture, and history that affects us today. I am arguing that there is little to no value in all students having to learn of details like specific battles of the Civil War, or the politics of the early 1800s. These topics should be pursed electively.


- I am not arguing that these classes lack value only because they do not tie to future careers. I believe these two courses majorly fail to provide value. I agree that math and science courses do not necessarily tie into future work, but I believe they accomplish their goals more effectively.

I admit I may display a STEM-favoring bias due to my field of study and work, so I am willing to accept arguments that show that my view is a function solely of my bias and not of reason.

EDIT: Want to clarify that I still think history should be taught at a general level in school. I don't think it should be as detailed or exhaustive as a part of the core curriculum. In other words, I think the necessary history can be taught in fewer total classes

EDIT 2: Pretty late in the cycle now, but I'll add this regardless since I've engaged with a lot of arguments that misinterpret my post. I am not arguing against the value of History and Literature. I am saying these classes are ineffective in their current forms</original_post>

    <text>Does something need to be applicable to your life to provide educational value? 

That seems to be the built in assumption but I want to clarify.</text>

    <text>No, and that's an important clarification for my viewpoint. I don't require the curriculum to be applicable to students' lives.

My argument is that the courses I mentioned do not provide value overall. The benefits of these courses can be offered much more effectively through other courses like debate or technical writing courses.

For example, I would consider learning about the World Wars to be valuable since they form a crucial part of our society's background. However, I think learning about the Battle of Stalingrad is extremely excessive. The latter seems to be the way these courses are taught</text>

    <text>I understand that you can’t teach everything but I don’t understand the lines you are drawing. The battle of Stalingrad is basically the pivotal battle of the war and is emblematic of the changing tides of the war. Why is that extremely excessive? 

Also, I don’t quite get the connections. Debate is much closer to philosophy than history. Why not just teach that? Or why not just cut history and teach debate? 

Also, technical writing isn’t really English lit at all. I’ve studied both and they are basically alien subjects. What do you think is the value of English lit?</text>

    <text>Also the battle of Stalingrad gives a lot of insight on Soviet hardship &amp;amp; attitudes during WW2. Something that is typically completely ignored by Americans and can teach a lot of insight into modern Russian attitudes about hardship and their flavor of authoritarianism.

I think a lot of your issues are more with the rote memorization style focused on memorizing names &amp;amp; dates,  and the general crappiness of the US educational system.

To use a STEM analogue, imagine coding was taught by memorizing a standard library rather than actual exercises. That would be stupid.</text>
