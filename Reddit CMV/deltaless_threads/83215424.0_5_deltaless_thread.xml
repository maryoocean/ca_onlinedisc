    <title>I dont think manslaughter or any crime committed accidentally should be considered a crime. At all. CMV</title>

    <original_post>If it is proven that the offender had no intention of committing a crime, why should they be persecuted because the odds were against them? 


EDIT: Ok, many people have used the example of "what if a person is driving drunk and they kill someone?" I still think they should only be punished for driving drunk.</original_post>

    <text>That would be true if it were entirely an accident. Manslaughter isn't like when you trip and fall on someone killing them. It is when you are viciously beating someone and they die. It means you intentionally put someone in great danger that, although you didn't intend their actual death, resulted in them dying.</text>

    <text>Or "I just meant to give him the guy with peanut allergies, peanuts as a joke. I thought he would just swell up and stuff, I didn't know that he would die."</text>
