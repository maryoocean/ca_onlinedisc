    <title>I want to take "forgetting pills" to erase every bad memory I still can't get used to. (Some of which gave me ideations of suicide / self-harm.) CMV</title>

    <original_post>[I don't know HOW SOON these forgetting pills will arrive, but when they do, they won't be a moment too soon!](http://www.wired.com/magazine/2012/02/ff_forgettingpill/all/)

I'd bet heavily that these memory-erasing pills will cause suicide rates to NOSEDIVE. Happiness indices in countries with ready access to these forgetting pills may soar.

Still, I'll observe results seen in other people before I start on them myself.

I have reason to believe that when I forget all the unsolvable bad events in my life, and any bad memory that still hurts me to this day, I'll feel a heavenly bliss not felt since the happiest day of my childhood.

(If there's ANY OTHER way to feel total bliss again, then **PLEASE SHARE IT!!!**)

Some memories I've gotten used to and won't feel hurt by them anymore, but others are so hard to get over, that I look upon these forgetting pills as a kind of "last hope."

I've been told that "memories form who we are." There are many reasons why I don't like the way I (currently) am so that lends me reason to believe that I'll be a better person once certain memories are erased.</original_post>

    <text>Well, since it's apparently Steinbeck's birthday: "To be alive at all is to have scars. (The Winter of Our Discontent, 1961)"

I am a firm believer of experience. I have scars too, but they also allowed me to bond with others who've also shared the pain. My words would be hollow if I didn't know what I was talking about. And you; I would like the kind of person you are because you know shitty life can happen. You can relate to me. I would feel companionship in your presence because you know how I feel and that makes me feel less shitty because apparently I'm not the only one who got kicked in the face.

Ignorance, aka "heavenly bliss", wouldn't make you happy, it would make you numb. It's why people get high. As my mom always told me, a flower that has been grown inside a greenhouse cannot survive the weather. Don't put importance on the fact that it happened, but put importance in what happened after it. Who came to your aid. What helped you cope. Talk to me about your memories, if you want to. </text>
