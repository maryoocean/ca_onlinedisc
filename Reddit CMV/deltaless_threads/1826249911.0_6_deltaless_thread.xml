    <title>CMV: The only form of government that exists is Opportunism</title>
    <original_poster>jerkularcirc</original_poster>
    <original_post>Everything else is just propaganda. History has proven time and time again that countries will always do/find a way to do what they think is in their best interest, quite irrespective of morality, laws, or even their own “constitution”. These labels of government and/or thinking one type of governing is always better than another is purely a result of propaganda and has been a great blinder throughout history. 

In group vs out group aka “us vs. them” thinking has been shown by research to be one of the best predictors of human thought and behavior and it has been utilized by those in power for much of human history to control the masses.</original_post>

    <text>This is a logical error. It's sort of like saying, "A guitar, a cricket, and a police car all make noise, therefore they are all exactly the same."

Sure, opportunism might be an *element* of every governing structure, but that doesn't nullify the myriad other difference between liberal democracy, constitutional monarchy, authoritarian fascism, etc.</text>

    <text>it is simply the best reference/predictor of governmental behavior. 

You are ignoring the negative propaganda element of nationalism and it’s ability to cover up/lessen blowback of incongruent action of government</text>
