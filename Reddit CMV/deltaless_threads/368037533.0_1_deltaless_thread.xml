    <title>CMV: In the future when the average age of death is significantly higher than today, the age of adulthood will also be significantly higher.</title>

    <original_post>This is just something that popped into my head and I thought about it for a few minutes. 

The reason I think that if the average age of death is higher that the age that a person is considered an adult will be higher is because that is how our society has functioned so far. Long ago children were considered adults at maybe 13 or so. Now it's 18. I think this is because the age of death being greater now then long ago. So I'm just extending this reasoning to the future. 

Really I made this post so that I can hear some better reasoning as to why this would happen or why it wouldn't. 

Cheers!

    <text>Adulthood is largely signified by the age of physical maturity. That won't change as our lives become longer. Yes when our lives were shorter on average in the past adulthood was classifies differently, but that was based on old information. There is no logical reason for adulthood to be redefined at this point. We essentially know the definitive end of childhood.</text>

    <text>I was under the impression that the brain doesn't really finish developing fully until around 25 or so?    
     
If that's the case, I would think that if we lived longer, 25 would be adulthood.</text>
