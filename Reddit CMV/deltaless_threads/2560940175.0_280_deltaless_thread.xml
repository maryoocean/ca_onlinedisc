    <title>cmv: There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as an “American”</title>

    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>Because ***of*** signals the start of a prepositional phrase, which propositional phrases are simply helpful yet largely extraneous to the intrinsic meaning of the subject being described. The subject of this phrase is the United States, which suggests any formal name should not be the descriptor given within the propositional phrase but the subject of the phrase itself - the United States. 

It's like calling the Library of Congress, Congress, and if you worked at this library you're a congressian instead of a librarian.</text>
