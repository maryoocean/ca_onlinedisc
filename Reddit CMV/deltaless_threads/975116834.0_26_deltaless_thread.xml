    <title>CMV: Racism towards white people exists</title>
    <original_poster>OnlyNineteenLetters</original_poster>
    <original_post>Racism by definition is prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.

People throw around that racism is based off power+prejudice but that is incorrect according to the definition. They seem to think that because white people are 'dominant' in society that you can't be racist to them because of their position, but that is not true. People who say reverse racism does not exist are right, because it is normal racism. Racism is based purely off that: Race. Not power or position in society. 

The power+prejudice argument was invented so that certain parties could espouse racist views without the negative stigma of the term.</original_post>

    <text>The reason why the power+prejudice concept is useful is that it explains how minor acts of racism  can corner a sect of society and prevent social mobility. 

If one university refused to admit people under five feet tall, sucks for them. But if every single school or the most prestigious schools did the same discrimination, then people under five feet would face institutional discrimination.</text>
