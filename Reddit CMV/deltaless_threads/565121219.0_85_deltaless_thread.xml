    <title>CMV: it is a jerk move to play music while camping within earshot of other campers.</title>
    <original_poster>estheredna</original_poster>
    <original_post>We put a tent up in a state park campground for about 4 weeks out of the summer. Most of the time you can just hear nature, people talking, kids playing, lots of birds and squirrels  . Every 5th day or so, there is someone who brings some Bluetooth speakers so they can listen to music , but loud  enough  that people in a half dozen sites nearby get to ‘enjoy’ whatever they are playing. 

Right now I’m cooking dinner and the guys next to me are playing U2, Dave Matthew Band and similar inoffensive crap.

This would be entirely normal in a backyard gathering, but once you reserve to be in a public campground, it becomes selfish, intrusive,  rude.

Am I wrong?

(I know it’s a known risk of car camping. I’m not really  mad. More rolling my eyes. I wish they’d shut that crap off.  )

    <text>if you're in a public space, you should expect to deal with the public. that also means accepting the rules in that space. if they weren't breaking the rules, they weren't being jerks.</text>

    <text>I guess that’s the big question. Can something that is not forbidden still be rude?</text>

    <text>I think that, as other people have stated, it is possible and totally understandable to be annoyed by a lot of behavior you experience in a public setting including kids, dogs, and conversation. Does that mean it's rude to bring your kids or your dogs camping because somebody there might be offended? If you had followed through with your annoyance and complained to the people playing music, would you have been being rude to them?</text>
