    <title>CMV: Fredom of speech is far more important than a few people being offended</title>
    <original_poster>brbrWh0r3</original_poster>
    <original_post>Freedom of speech should be protected and kept, there shouldn't be people arrested for anti trans comments or insulting a soldier/soldiers, or for nazi jokes, or racist remarks or jokes.

Those should all be handled between people, if someone says stuff you dont like you handle it, simply block them or avoid them, theres a whole world you can be in and that persons in a very tiny part of it. 

It makes me nervous seeing people arrested and charged for saying things. It's only leading us to a place where we can be arrested for saying whatever the government doesnt like. And they shouldn't be in that much power to effect our communication with eachother. 

I live in scotland and dont feel I have freedom of speech anymore. 

(For the record I'm a white woman who's bi and have trans thoughts ig for those folks who say it never has been about me, it has sometimes, and in more ways than just those)

Edit: No it's not just anti trans people, Yes I believe crimes other than hate crimes involving speech should be illegal (threatening violence, doxing, defamation) but I also believe insults, jokes and bad takes or thoughts should not be.

Edit 2: Consequences for what is said like losing a job, getting insulted, losing friends ect is totally fine I just dont think the Government should be in charge of what can get you arrested in this sence.

Edit 3: I live in SCOTLAND in the UNITED KINGDOM or in BRITAIN depending what you say, I'm not american, im also not here advocating for my right to be a dick, im just saying the government arent the ones I want saying what I cant say, I mean twitter can destroy lives without them anyway.</original_post>

    <text>With the caveat that I am coming to this from the perspective of the US, with no real hate speech codes, I wonder what the outside edge would be for you.

The nearest neighbor is defamation/libel/slander. Indeed. Many hate speech laws are effectively against slandering a group, rather than an individual. In the US, I am permitted to say "Jews are money-grubbing swindlers," but if I say "George is a money grabbing swindler" (and he isn't) he can make use of the force of law to stop that. (And it should go without saying, but welcome to 2022, that I would never claim that of Jewish people, or of George for that matter.)

Parallel arguments have been made for the liberalization of everything from copyright law (why should I be punished by law for copying something?) to child pornography: while we should punish exploitation of children, the posession/distribution of child form should be allowed even if it "offends" people.

I am not trying to set up a false slippery slope here, where your advocating the legal distribution of racist, homophobic, etc. materials necessitates the legalization of child porn, I am just trying to narrow your view by understanding what you think should still be forbidden or controlled by law and what shouldn't.

Are you effectively arguing that Scotland (or the UK or Europe) should follow in the track of the US and allow for civil damages for individual libel, but not for group libel?

Or is the issue criminalization. Would you be OK with a law that allows members of a group to sue for monetary damages for group libel, if arrest and incarceration were off the table?

Or are you arguing that speech should be entirely unregulated, and no one should be in legal trouble for spreading revenge porn, sharing state secrets, providing passwords, pirating books, etc.?</text>
