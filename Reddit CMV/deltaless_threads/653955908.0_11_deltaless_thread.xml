    <title>CMV: Equastrian sports should not be part of the Olympics.</title>
    <original_poster>LarryAndBarry</original_poster>
    <original_post>The Olympics in my opinion, is to challenge the boundaries of a humans physical abilities and see who is the best of the best. Its amazing what the human body is capable of when pushed to it limits.

I understand the same level of commitment goes into being a horse rider, but I feel as though equastrian sports is more a test for the horses. In theory, a javelin thrower can use any type of javelin but still throw a winning shot, but a rider can't really do the same with which horse he/she will use, therefore relying heavily on the horses ability to perform as well as their own. In the same vein, why not include the traditional horse racing with jockeys into the Olympics. </original_post>

    <text>I would love for you to try to jump a two foot jump on a horse and then see if your opinion changes. Riding horses at that level takes an insane amount of strength and finesse. I’ve been riding and showing horses for fifteen years, and I would shit my pants if someone asked me to ride an Olympic level horse or jump a seven foot fence. Those horses are trained very well, but also extremely difficult to ride and control. I can guarantee that I, someone who has been taking lessons with a professional for fifteen years, would make an ass of myself on a horse like that. Don’t knock something until you try it. You have no idea how difficult riding at that level is. </text>
