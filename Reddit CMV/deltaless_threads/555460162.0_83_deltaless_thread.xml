    <title>CMV: Most people are not well read enough to reasonably advocate for political or economic change</title>
    <original_poster>I_am_Norwegian</original_poster>
    <original_post>**Edit: "Well read" was a poor choice of words. I think "have done their due diligence" might be more accurate.**

I'm writing this because I want to be proven wrong, because people saying political things, especially as if obvious has started to annoy and anger me more. Especially if they're making fun of someone for their political views, even if I disagree with those views. I hate feeling angry, so hopefully writing my thoughts out will help.

In trying to figure out my own political views, I've come to realize that I can't reasonably hold the views I held, or any other views. I studied economics, mainly the school of thought that appealed to me. But then more and more I came to realize that I couldn't say if the Keynesian or post-keynesian or the Chicago school or MMT etc. were correct, and that even people who devote their lives to the study of economics struggle with the same thing. The same thing happened in philosophy, especially as I came to realize the importance of epistemology and ontology.

And you can't reasonably expect people to put in the effort and time that it takes to sort through these fields. And that there is still such debate among the experts that even if you become and expert, the truth will not be obvious. I've come to understand what Socrates meant when he said something like "I only know that I know nothing".

I've also come to believe that people hold the beliefs they do more for social reasons. Less for the truth of the beliefs, but more because their reaffirm their identity, and their social bonds.

I can't blame them for that, or for not spending thousands of hours sorting through political thought, philosophy and economics. But a part of me still believes that they haven't done their due diligence, and I get angry that they can affirm themselves and their beliefs, while I sit here uncertain, unable to succinctly articulate why, or how to get this across properly.</original_post>

    <text>You would enjoy studying historical revolutions. There is a great podcast titled 'revolutions'.

There is a pattern amongst almost all the revolutions:

Phase 1: the political revolution. This is carried out by the educated (typically young unemployed lawyers or journalists) who might overthrow the government to adjust voting rights or land ownership. 

Phase 2: the social revolution. This is carried out by the poor uneducated masses. This is the riots on the street, the guillotines, the mobs. They aren't interested in the political question. They don't need an education to see the rich wasting food while they starve. Phase two always seems to catch the proponents of par
Phase 1 by surprise. 

If you assume the uneducated aren't suited to advocate for political or economic, then you'd be making the same mistake as many other historical figures. </text>

    <text>Except that I'd argue that revolution is the last thing you should do.</text>

    <text>Yeah, everyone agrees on that. Typically revolutions are preceded by decades or centuries of unrest and resistance to reform. </text>
