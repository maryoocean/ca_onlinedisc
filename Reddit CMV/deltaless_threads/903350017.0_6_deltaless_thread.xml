    <title>CMV: Israel is not the primary cause of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, nor can they do much to stop it.</title>
    <original_poster>thosewhowait</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've been seeing a lot of people and politicians argue that we need to put pressure on the Israeli government to end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. There absolutely is a humanitarian crisis going on there; the nearly two million Palestinians living there don't have clean water, building materials, or infrastructure. However, it seems to me that this is largely due to the fact that Hamas is the de-facto ruler of the strip. As I understand it, when Israel decided to pull out of Gaza, they established considerable infrastructure like greenhouses to give the Palestinians a head start, but as soon as they pulled out, Hamas organized parties to destroy the Israeli infrastructure that they left. Also, rather than using building material like concrete to actually build up high quality infrastructure, they use it to build tunnels under Israel so they can conduct terrorist attacks on civilians. Hamas has also been increasingly authoritarian and preventing rival parties to hold any public events, so the people's ability to put a more effective and people-oriented government into power is greatly diminished. Putting aside Hamas's corruption, they are also in a conflict with Isis (which has established strongholds in the Sinai, bordering Gaza) which is further distracting them from increasing the standard of living of their people.

I want to make it clear that I do not at all support Israel's expansion of settlements into Palestinian territory, and I genuinely do believe that some form of two state solution involving Israel and at least the West Bank will be possible, but with Gaza specifically, I'm not really sure what can realistically be done by Israel that would not put their citizens in danger. As I understand it, Israel limits import of construction materials because Hamas continues to use them to build tunnels under Israel, screens shipments to Gaza because of continuous rocket attacks on civilian areas by Hamas, and prevents free movement from Gaza to the West Bank because suicide bombings / stabbings are a serious issue there. It's a lot less infrequent for buses to blow up now, so it seems pretty effective. 

I really do feel that the Gazans are the true victims here, but I think Hamas is currently the main cause of their suffering, not Israel. Regardless, I'm not sure what a concrete, feasible action would be for Israel to help the Gazans that wouldn't open them up to further terrorism.

Also, I just want to clarify that this is about the *current situation*. I think it's another conversation about the events that led up to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a whole, but I'm more interested in discussing what Israel could realistically do *right now* that would not compromise their security.</original_post>

    <text>It is a complex issue with many factors affecting it - I wouldn’t want to absolve any party of their share of the blame. I do think the Israel could be considered the primary cause.

1. Firstly this particular issue wouldn’t have been the case if Hershl never conceived of a a Zionist state. 
2. The manner of that states creation caused a large refugee population to seek safety in Gaza. This was the major factor of why Gaza is so crowded, poor and hostile to Israel.
3. Between 1967-1993 Gaza was under Israeli military administration. I think it is fair to say the relative lack of development in this time could be partly attributed to those in charge.
4. It is worth looking at [this UN report](https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/D04179FF8BE2A5D28025641B00514D74) on the changes to the Palestinian economy between 1992-5.
5. A British Parliamentary commission found that from January–April 2006, the Karni crossing was closed 45% of the time, and severe limitations were in place on exports from Gaza, with, according to OCHA figures, only 1,500 of 8,500 tons of produce getting through. They were informed most closures were unrelated to security issues in Gaza but either responses to violence in the West Bank or for no given reason. 
6. Hamas only took power in 2007. Considering the generations of grievances it is understandable why they were able to.

I understand Israel’s desire for security and don’t condone any violence... but it’s hard to argue that Israel was not the primary cause of the humanitarian crisis. 

So what could Israel do now to help?...</text>

    <text>This is a very difficult question... it is possible to provide more humanitarian aid, relax restrictions on the movement of people and provide more investment to generate economic opportunities for residents of the Gaza Strip...

But then I think these could be bandaid solutions.  I think, while these are necessary in the short term, a political solution is required. The options as I see them:

1. A two-state solution where, through land swaps Israel and Palestine become two separate viable states. This could be difficult as Palestinian Territories are non-contiguous and full of Israeli settlements in the WB
2. A one-state solution whereby Israel gives up on being an explicitly Jewish state but rather a secular one giving all citizens equal status. Unlikely considering the animosity between the hardliners on both sides.

With these difficulties unfortunately I just see a continuation of the status quo. There’s need to be some strong/competent leadership and a willingness to make concessions from both sides that I haven’t seen yet.</text>

    <text>Go back to the original lines for starters. Yes, the Palestinians rejected the offer then and i can't say i blame them for it.</text>

During which life, while still shitty, was inarguably better than it is now.</text>
