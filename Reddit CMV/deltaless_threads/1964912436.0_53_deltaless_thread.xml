    <title>cmv: K-12 Educators push a false narrative that all college degrees are good investments</title>
    <original_poster>Suitable-Ad-8598</original_poster>
    <original_post>Students in high school are bombarded with pressure to go to college by educators, with high emphasis on the ranking of the schools they are accepted into and no emphasis on the majors that they choose.

Nobody is warning students that picking liberal arts majors (unless they go to an ivy league school or something like it), will probably make them financially worse off then not even getting a degree in the first place. I know a girl that did gender studies at Columbia and is working as a barista several years out of college and is in about $400,000 in debt. I went to a way worse school than Columbia and nearly all of my friends with liberal arts degrees are stuck working as cashiers and in food service. I know a ton of people who went to community colleges (which was highly frowned upon in my high school culture) who are making six figures a couple years out of school (STEM and sales).

Why are we not being honest with these kids about the consequences of incurring student debt in unusable majors? I am not saying people shouldn't have the right to make their own major choices, but this is like handing children a pack of cigarettes and not telling them it causes cancer.

Edit: I probably exaggerated when I said worse than no degree if we are talking about long-term in their livesâ€”I kind of meant in place of certifications or bootcamps.  What I should have said is that the lack of jobs in liberal arts fields seems to not be communicated to kids, which has significant negative financial consequences.

    <text>I find it amusing that you only use a qualifier to denote which college degrees but not any to denote which educators.

When I was doing my rounds for teacher prep, I had one month where I ended up in two different high schools.

One of them would tout it's 100% college acceptance rate (meaning every single student had at least one acceptance letter from a college, Community Colleges did count if you read the fine print)

The other school, they were trying to make every student eligible for trade schools. They held a presentation for the entire student body and told them "if you work hard, and listen to us we should be able to get you into a trade school"

I will easily agree that the K-12 system as a whole did what you said. But not every school, and more and more schools are accepting that College is not for everyone.</text>
