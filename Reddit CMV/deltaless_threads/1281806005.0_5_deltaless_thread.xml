    <title>CMV: While the GME squeeze is a powerful display of retail trader’s power, there is no endgame that doesn’t result in them losing massive amount of money.</title>

    <original_post>The GameStop squeeze carried out by r/wsb and others demonstrated the power of retail traders and seems like a fair punishment on market makers and hedge funds that have taken advantage of the stock market for ages, but there is no way that it will end well for them. Sure, a lot of stock brokers have lost millions on shorts because retail traders refuse to sell and are still buying, but they can afford to do so because they have enormous amounts of cash to rest on and because GME is clearly overvalued. GME’s market cap is several times its revenue, and the only reason it is that high is because of the artificial demand created by internet communities. At some point, sellers are going to fold and GME is going to collapse, and everybody that purchased it when it was overvalued is going to lose massive amounts of money, while Wall Street short sellers laugh their way to the bank.</original_post>

    <text>The basic principle behind a short is that you borrow a stock from somebody.  Say you own one share of acme, and lend it to me.  I immediately sell it for 100 dollars.

Maybe a week later i need to return to the stock to you.  If i can buy it for 90 dollars i make money.  If i can't buy it for 110 dollars i lose money.  But i have to return the stock to you (not just dollars value) so i have to buy that stock back at market price.

What's happened with GME is that so many people are buying that the price is through the roof.  I need to buy back my share and return it to the lender but its no longer selling for 100 dollars a share, its 1,500 per share.

the end game is for the retail investor to start selling as these short/loan start coming due.  When my contract obligates me to buy at the market price there will be a huge transfer of wealth to whoever is selling at these crazy inflated prices.

that's the PLAN.  You might argue for some reason that the plan will fail.

From the VERY light reading that i have done, a lot of these short contracts come due tomorrow morning.  WBS is pushing hard the narrative that everyone must hold till then.

Once they stop holding things get dangerous.  The smart tim to sell is now.  But if people sell now the price falls and the shorts are covered.  The late-to-the-party retail investors lose big.

So like, don't get me wrong, i am not buying in.  THere is huge risk here.  But there is a plan and there is an endgame.</text>

    <text>Isn't this the most obvious short position of all time? There's no way the stock holds this price for very long. If I had some $ to play with. What would be the risk in shorting it now at this high price?</text>

    <text>You do know that you would need to actually find someone with stocks that believed otherwise in order to make the short position, right?

Short positions are basically bets between two individuals on whether a stock will be more valuable tomorrow or today.</text>

    <text>Nope didnt know that. Honestly not very educated on the matter. I thought there were places that automatically let you set options without needing another party.</text>

    <text>Really, this argument can also be applied to long positions, no? If there's a buyer, there's a seller. If you are buying a stock from someone, they obviously believe holding it will be less profitable than not.</text>

    <text>The difference is that in short positions, the other party gets the stock back at a later date, along with interest during the time that you are borrowing it. In normal long term investment, you don't have to believe that something will do poorly in order to sell. You simply have to believe that another stock will do better over time.

In short positions, one party needs to believe that a stock's price will fall by more than the interest paid during the borrowing, while the other party doesn't believe this. In other words, shorts require one party to lose, while long term investment allows for the parties to win, though possibly at different rates.</text>

    <text>The risk is the same as the one the hedge funds faced: uncapped loss. Also, for short selling, you need to borrow the stocks from someone else, so you need to pay them interest. The interest you need to pay to short GME is insane. Currently, it is 32%.

To illustrate:

- You have $1000 and 1 share of GME is $300 right now. 
- You short 1 share, and now you have $1300 in cash and -$300 in equity, account value is still $1000 (unchanged). 
-  Tomorrow, GME grows to $1000. You have $1300 in cash and -$1000 in equity. $300 in account value. You just lost $700.
- You may not think this is a big deal, after all, GME will go down eventually, right? Well, if GME ever grows over $1300, you'd have $0 balance in your account and get margin called. That's when the broker liquidates your position to manage risk, leaving you with nothing. No cash, no equity, you're broke.
- Okay, what if GME never grows higher enough for you to get margin called? Eventually it's going to come down and you'll make money, right? Wrong. You still have to pay interest on the equity you borrowed. If GME stays at $1000, you'll need to bleed 32% interest on that $1000. 32% is pretty much loan shark rates, and represents a huge amount of opportunity cost.
- Okay, but GME will never grow to $1000, right? Again, wrong. This is the same mistake hedge funds made. GME grew 10x within the past week, and 100x within the past few months, and you think it's impossible for it to grow by 3.3x in the near future?
- Finally, analyze what you would gain if you short the $300 shares. Even if tomorrow GME drops to 0, the max you gain is $300. Would you really want to risk uncapped loss to gain $300?</text>

    <text>Thank you for a really good explanation.

My understanding of short selling was completely off.
 
I thought if you bought at 300 and it dropped to 3 youd get 100x the return.</text>

    <text>The old adage is the that the market can remain irrational longer then you can remain solvent.

It seems certain that the price will come down, but can you correctly guess WHEN it will come down.</text>
