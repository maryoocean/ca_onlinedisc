    <title>CMV: Parrots don't make good pets.</title>
    <original_poster>KnightWhoSaysNi1</original_poster>
    <original_post>Just to be clear, I'm not in a place in my life to get a parrot, nor do I want one, as you can tell from the title of my post. But I want to find out why people find them to be good pets.

Here's why I don't think they make good pets:

1. From what I've read about them, they're on the emotional level of toddlers. And while human children are toddlers for a few years, parrots can live around eighty years. So you're dealing with a toddler for eighty years.

2. To add onto the previous point, they can live eighty to ninety effing years! Cats and dogs can live around twenty years, and that's a reasonable time commitment, but for a pet with the kind of lifespan that a parrot has, even if they have the very best outcome and have an owner who makes a lifelong commitment to them, there's still a good chance that they'll be uprooted from their home at the very end of their life.

3. From everything I hear and read, they require a ton of work! They seem to be messier and more expensive to take care of than dogs and cats, and after all that work, you can't cuddle them like dogs and cats. It also seems like it's hard to find a vet for them, and I'm guessing it would be way more expensive once you do find a vet.

4. They're loud and neurotic. If you don't devote a huge amount of attention to them, they screech all the time, pluck their feathers out, and attack people. I've heard a cockatoo screech, and I think I'd go insane if I had to listen to that sound in my house constantly.

With all this out of the way, I'm not going to pretend that I don't think that they're cool animals. They're really beautiful and seem pretty intelligent. It's neat that they can talk, and maybe for people who are not me, the novelty of them talking wouldn't wear off after ten minutes. I just think they'd be better off at zoos or wildlife sanctuaries where they have enough space to fly around and have a team of dedicated people than as pets in people's homes. Change my view!

    <text>Some people find it very valuable when a pet can talk, enough so to justify all the costs. :)</text>

    <text>Hmm. I mean, it's cool that they can "talk" in the sense that they mimic human speech, but it's not like you can have a conversation with them. And they also repeat what they hear, I sure as hell wouldn't want a pet that repeats snippets of private conversations around people who are visiting.</text>

    <text>This does give them a leg up against other animals. Many of the owners seem very proud and enjoy very much showing off their pet's ability to use human words. There is also pride involved, and a bit of what makes some people wear uncomfortable clothes for looks, or buying some overpriced, yet inconvinient beats/apple products. Some people like it, if you don't fair enough. But it is impossible (or rather very hard) to change someone's arbitrary view about something. It comes down to personal prefferences, and when they are set to high tolerance of cost, high proclivity for exotic stuff, high proclivity for status, parrots make the go to pets.</text>
