    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>If you become a cop it's because you think you'd make a good candidate to decide who lives and dies in any given situation, which automatically makes you an entitled piece of shit in my eyes. I get their utility but cops are always the guys who you're afraid to piss off because they're psycho on some level. I'd say "not all cops" but I've met an absolute fuckton of cops and I can count on one hand the number of genuine, feeling human beings who weren't smug pieces of domineering shit.</text>
