    <title>CMV: There is no reason to refuse to sign a pre-nup unless your reasons for marriage are corrupt to begin with.</title>
    <original_poster>dumbbuttloserface</original_poster>
    <original_post>I know that a lot of people view pre-nups as “insurance” in the case of divorce. And I get it. If someone is entering into a marriage with a LOT of capital, and the other person comes from significantly less, it makes sense to want to make sure that what’s yours, stays yours. 

But I think a lot of people (at least in media portrayals and stories from friends) are very against the idea of signing one and I don’t get it. If you love someone and you intend to be married to them forever, a pre-nup is essentially pointless. To me, it only seems like you would refuse to/be adverse to sign a pre-nup if you’re marrying someone because you see the relationship as potentially beneficial for you in the case of a divorce. 

I’m interested in hearing anyone’s opinion, but particularly the opinions of those who have been in this situation, i.e. the one asking for the pre-nup or the one being asked. Thank you!!

EDIT: I’ve awarded 3 deltas on this post so far because of some very valid points. The most convincing of which was that a prenup compels the person signing to be in a potentially extremely difficult and even dangerous position in the case of abuse. Someone else provided me with a very convincing analogy which put the whole issue in a new light for me. A third person suggested the possibility of an unfair prenup; I understand why you would not sign one, however, after re-negotiating the terms to a place where both parties can be satisfied with the prenup, it would then make no sense to continue to refuse to sign. And if the person asking for a prenup refuses to compromise on unfair terms, you probably shouldn’t be marrying them in the first place, imho. 

Ultimately, my personal experience has shaped my view so that I have no issue with signing a prenup with my partner, but I do see now that the issue is much more multi-faceted than I had previously believed. I suppose my view on the subject now is: there is no reason not to sign a prenup if the terms are satisfactory to both parties and there is room for a discussion between the couple. If your SO refuses to compromise on any point or even engage in a discussion about the terms, you probably shouldn’t be marrying them in the first place as they clear don’t see you as an equal. 

So I guess...view shifted/expanded, but not altogether changed. </original_post>

    <text>I think there are two points to look at. 

First, from the viewpoint of the person proposing for a prenup. I think there are many reasons why one would want to, especially as you have mentioned, if there is a huge financial disparity. 
*Personally* I feel that any guy should have a prenup. Why? That's because in the event of a divorce, the law favors the woman. If the judicial system is one of a jury, people are inclined to side with a woman. This might ruffle some feathers but this is what I *personally* feel. It's like insurance. You buy it not because you expect to die in a car accident, but if so by chance it happens, you are prepared for it. You could really mean to stay with your wife for the rest of your life, but what happens if she cheats or initiates a divorce? Can you be 100% sure that she will not do it? Therefore, from the proposer's point of view, a prenup is best seen as insurance.

Second, we have to look from the viewpoint of the one being proposed to. I think we have to be fair here, we can't say that everyone who refuses a prenup is someone that wants to ultimately benefit from a divorce or has some ulterior motive. Humans are naturally suspicious creatures. If my husband-to-be proposes a prenup, the first thought would be: why? Then after the "why" comes a whole series of "what is he planning". 

See, if you plan to give your whole life to someone wholeheartedly, you would at least be insulted that he wants to bank out some "insurance" on the whole marriage. This might mean that at some level, he might not trust you or this relationship as a whole. Or it could mean that he is cheating and would want some form of insurance in case you find out. There could be a whole lot of other scenarios but there is no way to confirm anything. Therefore, you obviously would not want to sign the prenup. By signing the prenup, essentially you are telling him: do whatever you want, the worst penalty is divorce anyway and there's no financial penalty. 

So you could see why someone would be at the very least hesitant to sign a prenup in this case. It could potentially open up a whole can of worms and test the relationship.   </text>
