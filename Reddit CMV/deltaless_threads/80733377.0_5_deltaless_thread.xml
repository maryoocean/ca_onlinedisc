    <title>I think that welfare recipients should endure random drug testing as a condition of receiving benefits. CMV.</title>

    <original_post>99% of jobs I've held have required drug screening at random or as an initial condition of employment.  I think that all adults who receive welfare should be subjected to the same screening process.  This should be a federal addendum to all state welfare programs.</original_post>

    <text>It is not seriously possible to get off most hard drugs simply by force of will. No matter how much you want to stop being addicted to heroin heroin withdrawal is medically serious to the point where it can put you in the hospital. And of course besides that nearly nobody has the willpower to push through something so incredibly unpleasant even if it weren't dangerous to do so.

Because of this, and because the point of welfare money is to buy minimum survival necessities like food and shelter, what your proposal is saying boils down to "heroin addicts should starve to death". I don't think that you'd endorse that statement by itself but it's an inevitable consequence of what you've said.</text>
