    <original_post>Homosexuality is not natural, and neither is heterosexuality

There is no such thing as attraction in other mammal species, just the male raping the female and reproducing. 

Attraction in humans is a social construct. It's a way to soothe people or to bond similar to how bonobos do it.

Because us humans have “the instinctive need to produce offspring,” the sheer fact that men want to have PiV sex with women just for fun or without wanting kids, proves it's not a natural attraction.

Plus, most women don't care about being penetrated. It doesn't feel good for us, clitoral stimulation is a need for most. PiV sex has no purpose outside of getting pregnant. Sexual relationships are not necessary at all.</original_post>

    <text>Sure it is.  Without it you would not be here.  Isn't that sufficient evidence of it's naturalness.  The entire impulse for women and for men to engage in sexual intercourse is based on sexual attraction.  

Further, the fact men want to do it "just for fun" (and women want to do it just for fun) is exactly and precisely evidence of how natural it is.  If you want to maximize advantage in natural selection the people who want to have sex are going to have more babies than those who do not.</text>
