    <title>CMV: Twitter is nearly unreadable and people mostly only use it for posting</title>
    <original_poster>aurochs</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have tried many times to get into Twitter but I am always astounded by how visually unfriendly the experience is. 

Problems:

* There are so many out-of context sentences with people replying to each other but I can't see what they're replying to unless I click around for a while. Couldn't the replies be grouped with the original tweet without having to click on the name and then click 'details?'

* Some people are writing paragraphs spread out over multiple tweets so this leaves their rant broken up by unrelated tweets from other people. 

* I try to follow some comedians, but their tweets are usually something like "I'm in Chicago tonight, come my show. Now I'm in Minneapolis..."

* No categorization. Subjects are all over the place and common topics are not grouped together.

* Too many weird @symbols and #hashtags and http://links just creates a fatiguing reading experience.

I understand the reasons for all of these issues but they are all problems that have been solved by other platforms like reddit and Facebook. I can't understand why twitter is so popular despite all of these points. It could easily be so much better.

    <text>Twitter the website is nigh-unusable, but Twitter the service is pretty usable.

&amp;gt; There are so many out-of context sentences with people replying to each other but I can't see what they're replying to unless I click around for a while. Couldn't the replies be grouped with the original tweet without having to click on the name and then click 'details?'

Yes, they could! In Tweetdeck and Tweetbot and a lot of other Twitter clients, it's one click (or on mobile clients, gesture) to bring up that view. You can also create lists to group people together and view them in different columns/views, which makes it easier to follow a conversation or the overall zeitgeist of the day in a given community.

&amp;gt; Some people are writing paragraphs spread out over multiple tweets so this leaves their rant broken up by unrelated tweets from other people.

This will frequently be handled the same way as conversations/replies, an invisible reply-to-self that makes them all show up in the same conversation view. (People also often Storify them later, but that's a separate service.)

&amp;gt;I try to follow some comedians, but their tweets are usually something like "I'm in Chicago tonight, come my show. Now I'm in Minneapolis..."

Then don't follow them; follow someone who uses Twitter in a way you find more engaging. How is that any different from a shitty blog or Facebook page or Tumblr or mailing list?

&amp;gt;No categorization. Subjects are all over the place and common topics are not grouped together.
&amp;gt;Too many weird @symbols and #hashtags and http://links just creates a fatiguing reading experience.

    <text>Do you have a favorite twitter client?</text>

    <text>I use Tweetdeck on the desktop—there's a Chrome client for PC and then there's also a native Mac client—and Tweetbot on iOS devices. There's a version of Tweetbot for Mac, and I hear it's great but I'm not willing to pay over $10 for a Twitter client.

I never found a GREAT Twitter client for Android, but Plume was my favorite when I was on Android. I don't know how much that landscape has changed since I was last on Android, though.

(I hear Twitterrific is good if you want a free iOS option, but I haven't tried it in ages.)</text>

    <text>I was a longtime Plume user and switched over to Fenix recently. Both are excellent. </text>

    <text>I'm a big fan of the actual Twitter version for iOS. I've used several others over the years and it's always been the most user friendly for me. </text>
