    <title>CMV: If gender is a social construct, then so is race</title>
    <original_poster>BoppeBoye</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let us take, as a given, that gender is divorced from the circumstances of your birth, that it is not a mental illness, and that there is no biological basis for what gender identity someone should express. Have I phrased that effectively? I'm trying to be concise, but I want to portray that premise correctly.

Why, then, should race be different than gender? If race carries with it "shared experience" and "lived experience", etc - that assumes that the only way you could understand what it's like to be a minority is to have lived your entire life as that particular minority. I'm not arguing against that, I agree that there are certain experiences that I could not comprehend - for instance, overbearing &amp;amp; strict Asian parents with exceedingly high expectations. 

But, if someone can change their gender or decide (?) that they identify as a different gender without having the prior lived experience of said gender, then why can't someone identify as a different race?

I'm not able to encompass all the variables which could lead someone to identify as another gender, but is it not possible for someone to come to the same conclusion with their race? What if an Indian man grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood, saw or experienced the same (or similar) discrimination as them, had minimal exposure to Indian culture; and this led him to conclude that he identifies more closely as a black man, rather than Indian? 

I would also like to cite Rachel Dolezal, who was uniformly mocked for being (afaik) the first trans-black woman in the public eye. It seems similar to transgender discrimination to me, assuming that there is something wrong with her mentally for deciding to become a black woman... Anyway, I'm not really defending her because that's not really in line with what I described in the previous paragraph (she grew up privileged IIRC), but the public reaction of mockery goes against the leftist belief of acceptance, by my perspective.

So, in short, why can there be no such thing as trans-racial people, the same way there are transgender?

    <text>Sociologists tend to use the term ethnicity instead of race, just because of how race just categorizes your physical characteristics. Heres an example: A black man refers to someone with dark skin pigmentation. You would probably think "oh so he's African American?" Well not exactly, he could very well be a Jamaican immigrant. Or he could be from England. The point I'm trying to make is race is just referring to stereotypical physical characteristics, whereas ethnicity refers to their location and cultural background. 

Getting back to the main point: Gender identity is considered a social construct because it is largely determined by the geographical location and time period you're in. Think of the Elizabethan era where it was masculine to wear makeup and wigs, go to dances, and be very concerned with one's own appearance. But in modern day, at least in the location I'm in (rural North America) if you're wearing expensive clothes, focused on good hygiene, or dance you are considered feminine. This is what makes gender a social construct, because different places are going to assign you different genders based on their cultural background. 

Going back to race: As discussed earlier, it is mostly about physical characteristics. So it's less about what society considers your alignment on a scale to be (between Indian to black as your example stated), and about how you appear to be. So in my sociology course from my freshman year of College we had a "black" student who was raised in France, but studied abroad in Africa, even though he shared their skin pigmentation and similar physical characteristics, they considered him French, not African. So from our perspective in the west we would consider him black, but he considers himself French. You begin to see why me, being a white man, calling myself black, would be pretty weird, because race isn't a social construct, it's generalizing physical characteristics into groups. However, if I chose to refer to myself as German, over American that would make a little more sense, because my Ethnic background is a social construct. It refers to my cultural, geographic, and historical background. 

Race also can carry with it shared experiences to some extent. A black man raised in a predominately white neighborhood is going to have some similar shared experiences with other black men in their scenario, but a black man, raised in a predominately black country is going to carry completely different experiences then another black man. At this point you're just generalizing people with the same physical characteristics. This is why we use ethnicity over race, because that refers specifically to peoples' cultural background. 

Here is another example just for the fun of it: I have a half white, half hispanic friend (physical characteristics are of a white man) who was raised in a largely Mexican populated area. He refers to himself as Mexican, largely because he was raised with that cultural background and is what he identifies as. He lives in the United states, but doesn't really identify with as many American centric holidays, as he does the Mexican ones.

I guess the point I'm making is: No you can't refer to yourself as a different race because its not a social construct, but you can refer to yourself as a different ethnicity because that is a social construct. The word race often gets used interchangeably with ethnicity, when they are two entirely different things. Its the same thing with Sex being used interchangeably with gender. One is the physical, the other is the social.
