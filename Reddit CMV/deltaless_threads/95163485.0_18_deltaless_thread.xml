    <title>I think eugenics should be practiced for humanity's sake. CMV</title>

    <original_post>1. Although some disabilities aren't hereditary, almost all disabilities and mental issues come from genetics and genetic issues. 

2. I only believe this for people who'd be a complete drain on society. Yes, there are exceptions like Stephen Hawking and what not, but that's exactly what they are. Exceptions. I believe there should be no debate over those who're mentally insane as well. 

3. I believe the government should force this because the parents wouldn't know right from wrong while being distraught by emotions. Ultimately, it would benefit the parents much more to abort the disabled child. Have you seen how much of a life-ruiner those disabled kids are? 

4. They also cause anxiety in the parents because of the thoughts of what will happen after they're not around. 

5. It may seem inhumane now, but keep in mind that I'm talking about abortion here. The disabled currently alive can live their lives and what not, I'm talking about those that aren't born yet. Right when the doctors find out that the kid will turn out fucked up, they should do something about it.

6. Okay, okay. So you're morally higher than me. I'm a monster for thinking this way. **Can you honestly look me in the eyes and tell me that the lives of those parents of fucked up kids wouldn't be much, much better without all that bullshit? How many parents are having their money and time drained because of this stuff?** </original_post>

    <text>1) This does not make eugenics the only possible treatment. Rather, it is the most extreme.

2) Those exceptions also carry a point of view that few others have thanks to the coloration from their disability. Diversity within intellectual fields allows for solutions to be found that would otherwise not be.

3) This is not the purpose of government. Governments are a means of enforcing those few limitations of our freedoms which the absence of would allow us to infringe upon others. They have no business preventing us from taking on the risks or burdens that we choose outside that realm. You can waive your right to protection against theft, its called a gift.

4) Again, the parents should be free to make that choice.

5) Abortions are not entirely risk-free procedures and they can sometimes leave the parents with life long regrets. That choice should remain with the parents.

6) See #s 3-5.

Now for the real crux of the argument:

Most parents would simply avoid having the test done, even if it meant avoiding the doctor through the whole pregnancy and finding a midwife to deliver the baby. You are making an enemy of people your plan requires to be complicit for it to work. These types of programs simply do not work.</text>
