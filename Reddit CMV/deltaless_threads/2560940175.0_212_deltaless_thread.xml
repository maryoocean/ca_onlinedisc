    <title>cmv: There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as an “American”</title>

    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>Isn't the US the only country with America in the actual name, hence Americans?  It just seems like "Staters" or "Uniteds" seem a little awkward as well as not really identifying the people at all.

Americans does the trick nicely and references a single country without confusion.

It seems like it would be highly disrespectful to refer to Columbians, Peruvians or Chileans as Americans.  They live in the Americas, but they are not Americans, nor have any wish to be confused with such.</text>
