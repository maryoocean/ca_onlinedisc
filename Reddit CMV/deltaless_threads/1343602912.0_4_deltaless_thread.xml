    <title>CMV: The recent Atlantic shootings was not an anti-Asian event.</title>
    <original_poster>MacV_writes</original_poster>
    <original_post>A white man shot six Asian women along with two others in Atlanta. The narrative that has been that this is directly caused by anti-Asian sentiment driven by racist white supremacists stoking bigotry against Asians. To solve this problem, America must truly commit to not being racist, to listen to those in the Asian community, and to teach young white men in particular the privilege they have as well as the deadly effects of toxic masculinity. 

However, there are details that do not fit the narrative. 

A. The shooter said that this was not racially motivated. 

B. The shooter killed a white woman and white man. 

C. While the shooter had shared a post critical of China https://twitter.com/yellokeith/status/1372202427584192513?s=09 it never rose beyond the national condemnation -- and the victims were Korean.

D. White nationalists in particular are well known for their love of Asian peoples and Asian culture, due to their valuation of ethnostates. 

E. Intentionally racist shootings usually come with racist manifestos, shamelessly racist worldviews, racist narratives about how white people are facing oppression. 

F. The #1 systemic discrimination Asian people face is from Progressives championing 'meritocracy is racist' and 'Asians are white-adjacent' inflammatory racial rhetoric, resulting in concrete discriminatory politics targeting Asian people specifically by their race. https://www.newsweek.com/asian-americans-emerging-strong-voice-against-critical-race-theory-opinion-1574503 

G. Criticism of China as a global, hegemonic, communist power is mainstream and not founded on race or xenophobia. 

It is my view Progressivism is a system which converts Trauma into capital. It seems as though these current narratives are forcing an anti-Asian narrative as a politically motivated strategy to appeal to build on this system. People like Trevor Noah believe killing six Asian people necessarily is a racist attack. But that strikes me as intentionally crude analysis. Isn't it racist for us to project all Asians onto China? Aren't we racistly manipulating the narrative when we selectively emphasize race to push politics, especially when said politics advocates for formally discriminating against Asians as "white-adjacent?"</original_post>

    <text>You are just going to take the word of a mass murderer? That’s ridiculous. It ignores the fact that this guy is motivated to not get a federal hate crime charge. There’s also not a lot of facts about this defendant and your rushing to defend him. The only thing we know for sure is he targeted Asian women. That is race motivated on its face. And if you’re being objective, his actions speak volumes. His words are excuses.</text>

    <text>Usually racists -- especially extreme racists -- are proud in their views. It's particularly unusual for a mass murdering racist to say, well actually, it was by this other totally plausible, highly emotional motivation. 

&amp;gt;It ignores the fact that this guy is motivated to not get a federal hate crime charge.

That's very true. But, then again, there are other pieces that don't fit in. Namely, the racist right wing affinity for Asian cultures, his targeting Koreans instead of Chinese, and the two white people he killed.

&amp;gt;There’s also not a lot of facts about this defendant and your rushing to defend him. 

It's disgusting to kill women. I just think the anti-Asian angle in obviously politically motivated spin.

&amp;gt;The only thing we know for sure is he targeted Asian women. 

And white people. He killed two white people.

&amp;gt;That is race motivated on its face.

Anytime an Asian dies, it's racism??</text>

    <text>We’re talking about an individual. You want to generalize about what other racist people do,  as if that matters for a specific case. Also, two white people caught in crossfire doesn’t mean he wasn’t targeting Asians. You’ve clearly got your mind up and want to believe it’s not race motivated, but you can’t get around what actually happened. He went to Asian owned businesses and killed Asians.</text>

If we are disregarding his stated motivations _and_ disregarding the culture we are assuming he subscribes to -- that is hardcore white supremacist right wing -- then that's a problem.

&amp;gt;Also, two white people caught in crossfire doesn’t mean he wasn’t targeting Asians. 

Were they? Why do we want to believe they were? He is a racist with a burning hatred for China, but he targets Koreans he was getting handjobs from and missed twice, killing a white man and woman?

&amp;gt;You’ve clearly got your mind up and want to believe it’s not race motivated, but you can’t get around what actually happened. He went to Asian owned businesses and killed Asians.

Well it IS my view that this wasn't an anti-Asian event. I think it's a fair point that he may be trying to avoid Hate Crime prosecution. But, I think there's motivated analysis going on where we reason backwards from outcomes to derive racist systems to begin with. Outcomes are not the same as causes. I'm pretty firm on that.</text>

    <text>Where is the data that shows that racists have to be proud of their racism once caught, while charges are still being written?</text>

Pretty sure he's not thinking too much about the legal consequences of a murder spree.

&amp;gt;There’s also not a lot of facts about this defendant and your rushing to defend him. 

What? We're trying to figure out motivation. No one is denying he's a killer.

Do you think he's a better person if he murders 6 people for non racist reasons? If he killed white sex workers would that be better?</text>

And that they all worked at brothels. That's the detail to me that makes it seem like it wasn't a hate crime.</text>
