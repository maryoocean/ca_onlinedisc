    <title>CMV: Fredom of speech is far more important than a few people being offended</title>

    <original_post>Freedom of speech should be protected and kept, there shouldn't be people arrested for anti trans comments or insulting a soldier/soldiers, or for nazi jokes, or racist remarks or jokes.

Those should all be handled between people, if someone says stuff you dont like you handle it, simply block them or avoid them, theres a whole world you can be in and that persons in a very tiny part of it. 

It makes me nervous seeing people arrested and charged for saying things. It's only leading us to a place where we can be arrested for saying whatever the government doesnt like. And they shouldn't be in that much power to effect our communication with eachother. 

I live in scotland and dont feel I have freedom of speech anymore. 

(For the record I'm a white woman who's bi and have trans thoughts ig for those folks who say it never has been about me, it has sometimes, and in more ways than just those)

Edit: No it's not just anti trans people, Yes I believe crimes other than hate crimes involving speech should be illegal (threatening violence, doxing, defamation) but I also believe insults, jokes and bad takes or thoughts should not be.

Edit 2: Consequences for what is said like losing a job, getting insulted, losing friends ect is totally fine I just dont think the Government should be in charge of what can get you arrested in this sence.

Edit 3: I live in SCOTLAND in the UNITED KINGDOM or in BRITAIN depending what you say, I'm not american, im also not here advocating for my right to be a dick, im just saying the government arent the ones I want saying what I cant say, I mean twitter can destroy lives without them anyway.</original_post>

    <text>The way I see these laws is that they exist as deterrents which are incredibly rarely enforced. The amount of people who are convicted for these hate speech crimes yearly can be counted on one or maybe two hands. The amount of people who are driven to depression, suicide and are damaged by hateful speech is immeasurable in comparison. 

The law, especially in the UK, is full of examples of fairly draconic seeming laws which are enforced very rarely and exist basically on paper. A good example is the lockdown breaking laws and fees which have mostly been reversed retrospectively for people who broke the lockdown mandates. 

I think cherry picking laws and extrapolating them to an application that you perceive as the worst possible outcome and pretending like that’s the reality we live in is not a good way of analysing the actual application of those laws. If all laws were applied equally then millionaires would go to jail for tax evasion en masse and landlords would be held liable for incompetence and gross negligence. 

Out of curiosity, what in particular are you referencing when you are saying that you in particular don’t have freedom of speech anymore?</text>
