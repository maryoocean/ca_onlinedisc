    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>Tbh I have never heard a single person who believes "American" is "wrong" except for people from South America.

The majority of non-English languages use some variation of "American" to refer to citizens of the United States, *not* variations of "United States-ians."

The idea that Americans referring to themselves as American is a "mistake" unique to silly "uneducated" U.S. citizens is just something that South Americans like to tell themselves, when in reality, literally no one else in the world besides them shares that view.

Even your European classmates are not representative of what most typical Europeans would say; I suspect these were just typical overexcited college kids trying way too hard to be politically critical/radical/correct, as college kids tend to do.</text>
