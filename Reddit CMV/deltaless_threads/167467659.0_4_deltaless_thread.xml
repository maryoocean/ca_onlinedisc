Almost none of his comics were actually relevant or topical in any way.  They were basically just shock-jock level of "oh hey look how insulting I can be, come at me bro."  If he hadn't just been killed by a terrorist, this was basically 4chan level of trolling. Not even that really. 

"I don't have a wife or children or credit" etc, sure that applies to him, but not the other people killed. And, frankly, his comics were awful, pure 100% trolling, but now they're "genius" because he's dead.</original_post>

    <text>Let's assume you are right and that he was a shock-jock type of journalist, and he was a massive troll.

Does this change the fact that he died for, and in a fight for freedom of speech? Does that alone not make him a matyr?

I don't know if I understand what your point here is. He was murdered because of his beliefs. That alone is enough to make him a martyr. He knew very well he could be killed, he stated as much, yet he still spat in the face of those who would kill him for his beliefs. I'm having a hard time understanding how that doesn't fit the definition of quite a great martyr.

The quality of his comics doesn't mean anything.</text>
