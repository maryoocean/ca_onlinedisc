    <title>CMV: The Idea that Anyone Criticizing the Ghostbusters remake will be branded a misogynist is a fabrication, motivated by people's desire to feel persecuted by feminists.</title>
    <original_poster>MisandryOMGguize</original_poster>
    <original_post>So, as you may be aware, the new remake of Ghostbusters, a movie surrounded by controversy, has been released to critics, and reviews are beginning to come in. The reviews are decidedly mixed, the top critics catalogued by RottenTomatoes.com are split 6 to 7 on whether it's fresh or rotten, with the rest of the critics generally being more positive. 

Reddit of course has an interesting history with this movie, which largely consists of a circlejerk every time it's brought up about feminism, SJWs and political correctness. This has not changed since the movie was released, with people in every review thread talking about how anyone that positively reviews the film must be a feminist, or be terrified of the feminist backlash for being critical of it. [This](http://imgur.com/a/fKRXP) is currently one of the top posts on the ghostbusters sub.

I've not seen any actual feminists claiming any and all criticism must be rooted in sexism. I've seen feminists saying that the immediate backlash to a female cast, dismissing it as political correctness, etc is sexism, but never the idea that any criticism is sexist. In fact, most of the feminists I've seen are fairly mixed, thinking the trailers weren't that funny, and that the black character's position in the crew plays on racial stereotypes.

So, I'm pretty sure that most of this is just reddit being reddit and jerking itself off about how edgy it is to go against the "feminist agenda," but I'd kind of like to believe I'm wrong, and that I ought to have more faith in people, so CMV. Have there been people being slandered just for not liking the film? Is there some vast feminist conspiracy to censor people who don't like the movie, and have any of the people writing the negative reviews faced this? Since I'm sure this topic has been discussed before, I'm also interested if anything has changed since the actual reviews were released.

    <text>Well, check out [this](http://fusion.net/story/276398/ghostbusters-trailer-backlash-sexist-comments/) article.

It's clearly, well, I'll let you decide for yourself.

However, my main point is this - look at the comment section they posted.

"This movie sucks" posts are put right next to comments like "psshht, female scientists yeah right" 

Complaining about a movie being bad isn't the same as hating the movie for being an all female cast, but this website is an example of people who can't seem to differentiate the two. </text>

    <text>I saw two, maybe three comments in that whole list that were complaining about things other than women/SJWs, and one of those was still ridiculously vitriolic. Also, I would point out that the very first line seems to differentiate the "baby men" from those who merely dislike or are neutral on the film.</text>

    <text>&amp;gt; stereotyping of whom?

By the author. "Baby men" is toxic stereotyping in the same way as feminazi is, regardless of how small the group the author trying to pin this on is. You are still creating a group who's opinions don't matter. Throwing people arbitrarily in that group is the way it actually becomes dangerous. And since it's such a vague, baseless stereotype, throwing people in is pretty easy.</text>

It actually did say just that. It said:

&amp;gt;Some people like. Some people love. Some people whatever. But baby-men, they no like. Baby-men no like at all.Â 

The article gives no room to dislike the movie without being called baby-men. </text>

    <text>Are people actually saying this? If that's the case then there needs to be a clear distinction between the two.

Disliking the movie for trying to push a feminist agenda onto an already established franchise for no real reason other than to push a feminist agenda is a fair argument to me.

Disliking the movie because it's a movie with females/female scientists is not OK.</text>

Bonus points when you replace an established male character with a female.

I'm willing to be convinced. Why would you replace the established, iconic Ghostbusters cast with a group of 4 female stereotypes?</text>

    <text>Because it has the potential to reach a potentially lucrative market that went previously untapped. The way I see it, the movie was most likely made because they thought it would make money. Sure, the movie obviously appeals to more women, but it's like that because women also spend money on movie tickets.</text>

    <text>They're splitting their fanbase this way though. They're turning an iconic franchise into a cash grab, alienating their previous fanbase, and probably not being a good enough movie to attract any new fans.

If they wanted to make a movie to appeal to women, then make a new franchise to appeal to women.</text>

    <text>That seems to be just your personal view of it 'alienating, not good enough', etc. rather than the actual result. Reviews are mixed, it's a perfectly average movie that will probably make some money. That's more than enough reason for a studio to do it, no agenda necessary.</text>

    <text>Feminist agenda probably came out a bit worse than what I meant. I meant that by by appealing to women, it has a detrimental effect to the franchise, and alienates the original fans.

I guess what I'm saying is, if you want to make a movie that appeals to women, it should be its own movie. If anything, this means that a female-centric movie needs an established male cast to rely on in order to succeed.

Financially, I know I'm pulling this out of my ass, but I would eat a ghost if this movie made more money than a movie with the original cast.</text>

    <text>I don't man, I'm not in the movie production biz or anything, but there are probably people with the sole job of weighing what type of movies will make money. They probably tested it out, and figured out that the influx of women outweighed the loss of die hard fans. If the movie was presented due to some feminist agenda though, I'm sure it would have been canned if they figured that the movie would crash. So maybe, just maybe, someone down the line, maybe a writer or something, could have potentially written the script because he wanted people to realize his or her feminist dream, but that wasn't the reason it got produced and pushed out to the public.</text>

    <text>And Hollywood gets it wrong more often that they get it right.

Feminist agenda was probably a bit too strong a word than what I meant. But replacing an entire male cast with a female cast has a definite feminist tone to it, you'd be lying if you denied that (which I don't think you are). I just think that should serve as its own movie.

Also Ghostbusters is an iconic movie, it would've made a killing if the original cast returned.</text>

  <comment id="28613471084.0" user="sassycatty" delta="False">
    <text>That's not what a cash grab movie is though. Reality would be what was stated. This new ghost busters *is a cash grab*. 

Reason why is because the original was a huge risk that ended up making some decent money. Hard to call something a cash grab when so much risk revolves around it. But some movie have much less implied risk because they are simply trying to feed off of the original fanbase. 

Loses meaning if you just apply it to anything that aims to make money..

    <text>I've actually heard the argument that just like how the original Ghostbusters were unappreciated in their field before starting the company, women in scientific roles seem to face similar levels of under-representation and ostracization. Creating an underdog parallel between both groups is not a half-bad idea.

The stereotype bit is much less-defensible, though I can't comment much because I haven't seen the movie myself.

EDIT: Got it, don't comment unless you're shitting on a movie you haven't seen yet.</text>

    <text>Speaking purely from personal experience, the image that first pops into people's heads when you say the word scientist is that of a man. That may not be the case with you and I applaud you for that, but I don't think it's "ridiculous" to say that it's common.

I didn't know that about the science degrees that's good to hear. However, many other fields are still very male dominated, so a "feminist agenda" should still be pushed. Maybe this specific movie focused on the wrong field, but that doesn't mean that having a feminist message is inherently detrimental to a movie. </text>

    <text>Not who you were responding to, but:

From 1999â2000 to 2009â10, the percentage of degrees earned by females remained between approximately 60 and 62 percent for associate's degrees and between 57 and 58 percent for bachelor's degrees. In contrast, the percentages of both master's and doctor's degrees earned by females increased from 1999â2000 to 2009â10. Within each racial/ethnic group, women earned the majority of degrees at all levels in 2009â10. For example, among U.S. residents, Black females earned 68 percent of associate's degrees, 66 percent of bachelor's degrees, 71 percent of master's degrees, and 65 percent of all doctor's degrees awarded to Black students. Hispanic females earned 62 percent of associate's degrees, 61 percent of bachelor's degrees, 64 percent of master's degrees, and 55 percent of all doctor's degrees awarded to Hispanic students.

    <text>For trying to push an agenda to the detriment of an established franchise? Yes. The main point of a film should be to tell a story with interesting characters. You can have feminist undertones, sure. But when it's so heavy handed like this, you can tell it was an explicit direction to pursue this type of movie, it becomes preaching, and no one likes preaching.</text>

    <text>Was the agenda a detriment? I haven't seen the movie yet so it is possible that they spend a lot of the movie blatantly preaching. However, from what I've seen of the previews, the only form of agenda pushing was casting women as lead roles. The fact that so many people are equating "women in lead roles" to "movie ruined by feminist agenda" is exactly why the "agenda" needs to be pushed. If they made a shitty movie, then they made a shitty movie. If you think they made a shitty movie because they cast women, then you're proving my point. </text>

    <text>It's not because they cast women, it's because they prioritised an agenda or idealogy before creating a quality film. For all I know, this movie might be miles better than all of the Ghostbusters and I'll have to eat my words.

But history does say that these sorts of movies that seek to pander to a certain ideology or movement, are usually less than good.

I am not saying that this movie will be bad because the cast are women, I'm saying the movie will be bad because they decided to cast actors solely because they are *women*. The fact that they are women is not the problem, it's that they pushed an agenda before creating a decent film. Again, I may be wrong; this film might be the best of the year for all I know.

&amp;gt; women in lead roles" to "movie ruined by feminist agenda" is exactly why the "agenda" needs to be pushed

I never said this. I'm all for more women in lead roles, as long as it feels organic and the writing is good. What I said was that people are saying that replacing an established male casts with a female cast is primarily because of a feminist agenda. And the problem with that is that it becomes propaganda instead of a narrative.</text>

    <text>Wow, so that's what it would look like if a Reddit shitpost became a news article.  The thing I don't understand is even if the movie looked like it would be good, can't we still attack the film for going in a completely different direction with a fully female crew and apparent man hate?  I mean some of the articles I've seen about this movie blast male reviewers because this film clearly targets women.  I wouldn't have a problem with that if it wasn't a Ghostbusters film or if it still tried to include men, but it doesn't.  They've taken a classic series that tended to have a male audience, stripped out everything that made it good, then added in a completely female cast instead of a mixed cast.  It has a completely different target audience than the originals while trying to draw upon its namesake, and that's just completely wrong regardless of how good or shitty of a movie it is.</text>
