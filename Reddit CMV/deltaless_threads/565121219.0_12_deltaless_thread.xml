    <title>CMV: it is a jerk move to play music while camping within earshot of other campers.</title>

    <original_post>We put a tent up in a state park campground for about 4 weeks out of the summer. Most of the time you can just hear nature, people talking, kids playing, lots of birds and squirrels  . Every 5th day or so, there is someone who brings some Bluetooth speakers so they can listen to music , but loud  enough  that people in a half dozen sites nearby get to ‘enjoy’ whatever they are playing. 

Right now I’m cooking dinner and the guys next to me are playing U2, Dave Matthew Band and similar inoffensive crap.

This would be entirely normal in a backyard gathering, but once you reserve to be in a public campground, it becomes selfish, intrusive,  rude.

Am I wrong?

(I know it’s a known risk of car camping. I’m not really  mad. More rolling my eyes. I wish they’d shut that crap off.  )

    <text>It's annoying, but that's why I don't camp within an earshot of other campers. It's not my right to tell other people what to do. I don't really consider going to a public cabin or wooden shelter to be "camping" per-say but rather just "outdoorsing" I guess. Camping is going out into the fucking woods, finding random twigs to make a fire, and random rocks to protect it. Go off the trail. Find some flat ground. Make your own campsite. </text>
