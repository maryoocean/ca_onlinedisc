    <title>CMV a society run via a libertarian meritocracy has the same outcome as a strict class (or caste) system.</title>
    <original_poster>that-other-username</original_poster>
    <original_post>For the purposes of this question, I define libertarian meritocracy as one where the government has almost 0 effect on day to day life, and people advance in society purely on the strength of their own skill or luck.

I believe this has the effect of creating and reinforcing a class system because of the fundamental inequality of birth. A poor person born into this society would have few chances for learning and advancement of their skills, while a rich person would have access to high quality teachers and resources that would help them get ahead.

After several generations, you would have rich families far more power and influence than any poor family, and they could easily conspire to keep it that way via nepotism and corruption. 

Once societal mobility is taken away, there's nothing effectively different about this society and strictly class based society.</original_post>

    <text>Why would a smart poor kid not have opportunities?  Even today in the age of public schools, many corporations fund supplemental education (especially in the sciences) to help ensure they can find good employees later.  How much more would they fund if students had more time, no stupid social studies classes mandated by the state, and better ability to work as teens?  Smart poor kids would work, learn, and be able to get promoted because it would be profitable to hire and teach them.</text>

    <text>Why would you hire a poor kid (which might have nutrition issues, or an imbalanced education or health issues) when you can hire a rich kid whose had a lot of great teachers and an excellent history?</text>

    <text>Either if the poor kid is smarter, harder working, more loyal, or has other good qualities, or if he's cheaper.  It's not like there are infinite rich kids applying for every job.  </text>

    <text>The unemployment rate is around 5%. Unless if 95% of the population is rich, someone is going to have to hire the poor kids.</text>

    <text>Unless if you think that a libertarian society would have an unemployment of 80%, the math still works out - people will run out of rich kids to hire at some point, much like in the real world.</text>

    <text>Why wouldn't the companies hire poor people for next to nothing, while only letting the rich people get good jobs? Objectively, the rich are better off and probably have a better education due to, well, being rich and since there's no government controls the rich can stack the deck.</text>

    <text>Or to put it a different way, the cost of education is all labor.  If salaries start falling for the middle class, that means education becomes cheaper approximately in proportion.</text>
