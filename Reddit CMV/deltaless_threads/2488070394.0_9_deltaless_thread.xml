    <title>CMV: People who surrender animals to the shelter shouldn't be required to do paperwork that identifies them or go on a 'sh*tlist' that prevents them from adopting from that shelter in the future.</title>
    <original_poster>ForsakenTakes</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'll start off by saying that I'm a licensed and registered veterinary technician who has experience working in clinics that do 'bulk' reduced cost spays and neuters for local humane societies and shelters.   
Yes, the sheer numbers of unwanted puppies and kittens- especially in the spring and fall -are next to impossible to keep up with. I hate seeing animals come in and out of the clinic that have been returned to their respective shelters, neglected, abused, or needlessly pregnant or intact as much as anyone else, because in the end it IS irresponsible people that cause these situations...   


However, I do not think that these shelters should be keeping what we call "shitlists" on people who responsibly surrender their pets they can no longer care for and go through the proper channels to surrender.   
What any shelter or rescue is doing by having you sign paperwork or anything regarding your surrender is basically adding you into a database of "irresponsible pet owners".   


Sometimes, this information is shared with surrounding shelters and rescues to deny future adoptions to people who've surrendered an animal *anytime in the past*. As far as I can tell, these databases are *forever*. If you surrendered a dog in 2002 because you lost your job and had to move into housing that doesn't allow pets for a few years, for example, they keep that surrender -and your reason- on file. And if you go in to adopt a pet today from that same shelter, you could be denied adoption because you're flagged in the system as an "abandoner". If your recalled reasoning doesn't match the original paperwork for surrendering an animal in the past -they will automatically deny you and assume the worst.  


I feel like making people identify themselves during the surrender process is counterproductive. The reason for this is it encourages blind dumping or abandonment at these shelters. We have so many pets left outside of these rescues/shelters that have requirements to fill out paperwork and provide identification that *more are dumped than people following protocol* by going in and physically filling out the paperwork. Because people know that they're going on some shit-list they don't know whom it will be shared with if they go in and "do the right thing".   


Sometimes these abandoned pets are left injured in crates- during the weekend or at night in harsh conditions when no one is there, simply because they fear being identified and judged for abandoning a pet they cannot care for. That's a big reason people re-surrender their animal- they get sick or get into an accident and the owner cannot afford the veterinary bills and are embarrassed and heart-broken.   
Allowing a 'no-questions asked' policy and 'baby boxes' have worked wonders for fewer unwanted babies being dumped in trash cans or irresponsibly on hospital property. Why can't we apply the same mindset to pets?   


I also don't feel like punishing someone for life is fair when people's situations change and improve all the time. Just because someone hit a rough patch 10 years ago and had to bring their cat back to the shelter doesn't mean they'll always be some irresponsible pet-dumper. (I think this is the reason they're so worried about the nature of the surrender, and want the paperwork in the first place.)   


Their hearts (shelters and rescues) are in the right place, but they're making things more difficult than they need to be when housing all of the pets that need it. There are way too many pets in need of homes to scrutinize potential owners to the point some of these shelters do. Some of these requirements are higher than many people in society hold to be a necessary threshold for caring for their own children and are excessive and ridiculous.   


TL;DR: Don't make people ID and "tell on" themselves when surrendering an animal because it makes more people just dump them instead. Also, don't just assume someone's a pos dumper for life just because they had to surrender in the past.</original_post>

    <text>I think tons of animals get dumped at a shelter due to owner negligence, but much of the time it's people's life circumstances that have unexpectedly changed.  For instance.  My wife and I used to rescue cats off the street, get them fixed, bring them into our home, etc.  Most of these animals would have been dead without us making that effort because some were very messed up.

And then my wife and I had a micro-preemie (1 pound baby).  Ended up losing our house and due to her frailties, my daughter had very severe and pronounced allergies to cat dander.  This, btw, is a baby with significant trouble breathing.  Could we have cats crawling around all over the place.  Unfortunately, no.  In our case, we were able to find homes for them, but almost didn't.  If we'd had no choice but to drop the cats off at a shelter--- already a hard choice that we didn't want to have to make--- is it fair to get put on a "you suck and abuse animals" $hit list?  Even though these cats would have been on the street anyway, were it not for us?

And I think this is probably beside the point.  If you impose penalties on people bringing animals to shelters, a crappy person will happily just dump their animal on the side of the road somewhere.</text>

    <text>The shit list isn't "you suck and abuse animals" but "you don't have the capacity to look after animals". You rehomed your cats because your daughter was severely allergic to cats. I would say, that is a very good reason not to allow you to adopt any more cats (certainly until your daughter was no longer living at home). And in any case, you wouldn't be on the list, because you chose to find homes for the cats yourself rather than dumping them. So you've proven that in a bad situation, you wouldn't just dump your cats, you'd responsibly look for new homes and look after them.

Unexpected things happen to everyone, the question is what do you do when they do? Do you immediately dump your pets at the shelter? In which case, what's to stop you doing the same the next time a blip in the road comes along? Or, do you try to work around keeping them, and if you can't, responsibly rehome them? In which case, you've proven that you won't just dump the next animal you get.</text>
