    <title>CMV:/r/redditarmie should be banned for the continuous raiding and vote-manipulation of YouTube comments.</title>

    <original_post>*"Those who spend their time pretending to be obnoxious idiots aren't really pretending."*

In case anyone's unfamiliar with the subreddit and its users, they're the guys that leave comments like [this](http://i.imgur.com/LQcYICz.png) on all YouTube videos that are trending on Reddit.

It was fun the first few times or so, but at this point it's just obnoxious and annoying, to a degree where there are more than 10 'joke' comments before you can even get to normal comments that actually refer to the video.

Since it's not uncommon to see entire subreddits get banned for downvote-and commentraiding other subreddits, why is it okay for a sub to be entirely devoted to raiding YouTube videos and manipulating comment vote counts?

I don't see this discussed often on Reddit and when it does get mentioned it's often downvoted to a very heavy degree, so please CMV because I'm obviously not getting the 'joke' here. Even if the joke is being annoying on purpose.

    <text>[Rule](https://www.reddit.com/rules) 2:

&amp;gt; Don't ask for votes or engage inÂ vote manipulation.

Neither the rules page, nor the rule's explanation, nor the page that the rule links to (explaining what vote manipulation is) specifies "on reddit".</text>

    <text>But it clearly seems to be the case. Unless subs have been banned for brigading Fox News polls and the like too, the only precedence is that subs who engage in this behavior on reddit are banned (or, ostensibly they should be).</text>

    <text>That doesn't change OP's view that they *SHOULD* be banned for that kind of behavior though.</text>

    <text>Well, I was going somewhere with my argument. Does OP think any sub that could be considered "manipulating votes" through organized efforts should be banned? For example, if a political sub encourages people to vote for one candidate, or to campaign for a political figure (which I would include AMA under, for sure), should these subs also be banned?

If the idea is that outside vote manipulation through organized efforts is the bannable offense, then I want to see if OP is consistent.</text>
