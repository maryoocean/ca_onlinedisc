    <original_post>The right to protest doesn't allow you to disrupt society. Terrorism is defined as violence or intimidation for political reason, I'd hope you agree that honking horns for hours in a city, displaying nazi flags, and destroying the economy all fit that definition. Protesters are not, or should not, be able to disrupt trade or impede traffic, and arguing otherwise is insane. These fucks are no better than the GQP who attacked the capitol, and they need to be removed from society. If not, they set the precedant you can destroy society if you call it a protest, which obviously can't be allowed to happen. My view will be changed if you can convince me that they aren't terrorists, or that their actions are in any way justifible.</original_post>

    <text>While I don’t agree with their cause, what you have described is not violence in any reasonable definition of that word. Abstract harm to an economy isn’t the same has direct harm to a specific person or property. 

Moreover, terrorism is specifically violence designed to cause fear or panic. The truckers were trying to disrupt, but that isn’t the same thing as causing fear. 

Protests are designed to be disruptive. If they aren’t, they will often fail to draw attention to the cause. The truckers disrupted the economy to being attention to their issue, but little to no direct harm was caused. That is a textbook protest. 

We can’t start labeling things terrorism because we disagree with what is being protested. That is a dangerous door to open, because our enemies can use the same definitions against us when they disagree.</text>
