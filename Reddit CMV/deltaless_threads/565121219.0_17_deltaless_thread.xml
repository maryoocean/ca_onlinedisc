    <title>CMV: it is a jerk move to play music while camping within earshot of other campers.</title>
    <original_poster>estheredna</original_poster>
    <original_post>We put a tent up in a state park campground for about 4 weeks out of the summer. Most of the time you can just hear nature, people talking, kids playing, lots of birds and squirrels  . Every 5th day or so, there is someone who brings some Bluetooth speakers so they can listen to music , but loud  enough  that people in a half dozen sites nearby get to ‘enjoy’ whatever they are playing. 

Right now I’m cooking dinner and the guys next to me are playing U2, Dave Matthew Band and similar inoffensive crap.

This would be entirely normal in a backyard gathering, but once you reserve to be in a public campground, it becomes selfish, intrusive,  rude.

Am I wrong?

(I know it’s a known risk of car camping. I’m not really  mad. More rolling my eyes. I wish they’d shut that crap off.  )

    <text>It sounds like you have more of an issue with the type of music played as opposed to the fact that its being played. As in your post and in any replies you've said "trash music"

If he was playing a playlist full of your favorite bangers would you still be objecting.

Maybe the reason theyre playing inoffensive tunes is because there are multiple people with differing musical tastes there so he's appealing to the everyman in his group.

Regardless its a public campground. If its not quiet hours its completley acceptable and normal to play music.</text>
