    <title>CMV: I think masturbation is bad for you.</title>
    <original_poster>TextingWhileDriving</original_poster>
    <original_post>I used to be part of the /r/NoFap community and felt good about it. I had a sense of pride when a day passed without masturbation squeezed in there. However, I never went longer than 2 weeks without masturbating. Each time I masturbated I felt a sense of dread and depression, knowing I would just masturbate again sometime later. 

Today I broke my 4 day streak. I feel depressed and stressed. This basically confirms how I felt about masturbation in the beginning. It's bad for you. You could change my view with study's or from experience yourself. Go ahead and try changing my view. </original_post>

    <text>Did you develop this opinion on masturbation by yourself? Given that masturbation provides satisfaction/relief I find it difficult to arrive at the notion that "it's bad for me" without any external societal force driving the conclusion.

"My hand is my gf", "only losers need to masturbate", so on and so forth. Are you sure these aren't the thoughts running through your head and not just the fact that you lost a streak? We all have a dependency on water/food but we don't get depressed when we *just have to eat*.</text>
