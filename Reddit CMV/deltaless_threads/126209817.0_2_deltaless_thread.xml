    <title>CMV: Money does buy happiness.</title>
    <original_poster>woflcopter</original_poster>
    <original_post>The term "money can't buy happiness" is, I think, false, mainly now within the past years. 

Let's give a scenario: you graduated college, got a decent $50k a year job and you live with your SO who makes around the same. Uh oh, student loans from college start to haunt you now, as well as car insurance, debt, mortgage, and maybe a dozen other things piling on top of that. Really the only way that you could "fix" this is by paying for it with money. 

And let's say that they somehow get a lot of money. And let's say they live in a world where there isn't really a tax or anything (think simple). They pay off all their debts and ironically all their money from that was the exact amount to pay everything off. They live much happier than before. 

And now you see how money buys happiness. It's true. Money does buy happiness. There are so many situations where money will solve your problems. I'm not trying to say how it's the only cause of happiness: there are things that can make people happy without the use of money, but generally if you have money it'll make you happier. I know that many people with tons of money are also depressed, but when you get a middle aged mid income family paying off all their debts and still being mid income, they are happy. Why? Because money.

    <text>In your example, money is the cause of their problems as well.</text>

    <text>True but there are many other situations where money does buy happiness without being the problem.</text>

    <text>Sure, but then you have a trite truism. "Candy bars make me happy. I buy candy bars with money. Therefore, money buys happiness."</text>

    <text>But having, say 10,000 candy bars is probably not going make you much happier than having 5000</text>
