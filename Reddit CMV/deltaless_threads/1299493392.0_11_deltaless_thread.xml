    <title>CMV: a better way to pay for college would be a wage percentage system</title>
    <original_poster>SaltySpursSupporter</original_poster>
    <original_post>instead of needing to take out thousands of dollars for student loans, maybe this is a better idea. instead of needing to pay money outright, negotiate a percentage of your future wage. depending on the program you're entering and the amount of years in that system, you can negotiate the percentage and the amount of years. if the person has a minimum wage job for the chosen amount of years, that's still all they get. i'm sure there are problems here that I haven't thought of. you're welcome to change my mind.</original_post>

    <text>The logistical and administrative maneuvering required for this system would be insane, time-consuming, and absurdly expensive.

Let's say there's a small liberal arts college that has about 1000 students per year. So over the past decade, they've graduated maybe 10,000 students.

So now, this tiny college with maybe 4-5 people in the financial department has to somehow track the careers, income, and finances of *ten thousand people* simultaneously. It would be virtually impossible.

This is why the government basically acts as a middle-man. Instead of thousands of colleges, employers, and students hectically trying to coordinate with each other, it just goes like this - a student takes out a loan from the government, the government pays the college, and then the student pays back the government. It all goes through one centralized regulatory body, which things far easy for everyone involved.</text>
