    <title>CMV: Accusations alone should not be printed by the media.</title>
    <original_poster>OGHuggles</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't care what percentage of them are true, innocent till proven guilty is a thing. The erosion of privacy and civil liberties is of great concern to me now and in the future. While I'm glad plenty of women that would have been ignored before aren't anymore, I don't think accusations should be straight up believed. I think they should be taken seriously, but they should not get media attention until a case is actually made. 

False accusations are a thing and lives have been ruined because of them. The most infamous case of this guilty before proven innocent going wrong, is the Duke Lacross case I'm sure most people have heard of.

Why should I not be concerned about this? Why is it ok to ruin people's lives based off of accusations alone?

    <text>The first person to go to the media in the Duke Lacrosse case was the prosecutor, who has since been disbarred for his handling of the case. The police who briefed him on the case had already stomped pretty good on the civil liberties of those in question, so whether or not the media reported on it was really the latest in a long line of problems. In fact, if it hadn't been for the media attention, the case may have been able to proceed all the way through to conviction un-noticed and unquestioned.
 
It's unfortunate that people always want to talk about the Duke case as an example of "crazy bitch goes accusin', ruins lives with help of the media" instead of looking at the ridiculously egregious failures of the police and prosecutors. Isn't it their job to make sure people aren't falsely accused? How are we shifting this responsibility to the media and telling them to hush when it's the P&amp;amp;P who have the real power to violate your rights and railroad you into a cell.
 
If you're actually concerned about the erosion of civil liberties and the rights of accused people, you should take a look at your local news media's weekly 'mug shot' round up. Mug-shots which the local police publish, thereby stomping the fuck out of the entire of 'innocent until proven guilty' ideal. There are thousands upon thousands of people who are accused of crimes (and yes, plenty of them sexual assault, since it seems that's your singular concern) who have their names and faces published in your local paper before they are ever found guilty. Even if they end up found not guilty or the charges are dropped, their names and faces remain to turn up anytime a prospective employer or creditor googles their name.  And these are people who don't get the benefit of oodles of press coverage reminding everyone that it's 'innocent until proven guilty' the way the rich and powerful and famous do. </text>

    <text>Why are you assuming I'm not against the latter?

    <text>Because you've repeatedly said that your primary concern is the way stuff is 'blown up' by the media, that what you don't like is when there are 'angry mobs'.</text>

    <text>How does that conflict with being opposed to publicized mugshots?</text>
