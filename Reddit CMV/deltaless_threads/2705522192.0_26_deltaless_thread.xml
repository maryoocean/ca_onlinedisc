    <title>CMV: Bodybuilding is stupid</title>
    <original_poster>RaindropDripDropTop</original_poster>
    <original_post>I want to be clear, I'm not talking about lifting weights in general, I'm specifically referring to competitive bodybuilding, especially when it involves cycling a bunch of gear (using PEDs), and getting to dangerously low body fat levels and severe dehydration to go on stage.  

I definitely recognize that competitive bodybuilders have insane levels of dedication and training. It is without doubt incredibly difficult to achieve those type of physiques, even for people with top tier genetics who use PEDs. Even the most genetically blessed and steroid enhanced bodybuilders still work insanely hard. I am not doubting their work ethic and drive. What I think is stupid about it is why do people think that this is worth it. 

For starters, it is purely for the sake of vanity rather than athleticism or strength. A bodybuilder might look absolutely insane, but functionally speaking, actual athletes who train to maximize athletic ability have way more physical capability depending on what sport they train for. Whether it's strength, speed, endurance, acceleration, vertical leap, flexibility, dexterity, or a combination of all these things, bodybuilders just aren't nearly as physically capable as actual athletes who put in similar time and effort into their training.

On the topic of vanity, bodybuilder physiques don't even look attractive or aesthetically pleasing. Obviously this is subjective, but the vast majority of the population is way more attracted to a healthy athletic physique than they are to a bodybuilder physique. I get that bodybuilding isn't really about looking attractive, rather it is about pushing the limits of what is possible with the human body, but it's honestly kind of just a freak show.

The biggest reason bodybuilding is stupid is that it is insanely unhealthy. Even for natural bodybuilders who don't use PEDs, they are still getting to dangerously low body fat levels and becoming extremely dehydrated in order to achieve their stage physique. This is incredibly taxing on the body, and it's extremely common for bodybuilders to suffer severe health issues because of this. For the ones who do use PEDs, which is basically a requirement to become a top level bodybuilder, the damage to health is even more severe, and they suffer many side effects as a result, especially ones who are not properly educated on the drugs they are taking.

One might argue that bodybuilding might be worth it for the money, but the reality is that only the top few bodybuilders in the world are making significant money through this career. The vast majority of bodybuilders, especially amateurs and people who do regional or local shows, aren't actually making much if any money through this. They also have to dedicate insane amount of time and effort into training, and if they are using gear, they are spending a ton of money on drugs. Moreover, there are similar alternatives to bodybuilding that are way more lucrative and more accessible to most people, such as becoming a fitness influencer or something (not saying that many people can break into that field either, but it's more achievable than making money through competitive bodybuilding).

The reason I am asking for my view to be changed is because I want to hear opposing perspectives, and maybe someone can shed some light on what I am missing. Like I said, I respect the work ethic and drive of bodybuilders, I just have a really hard time wrapping my head around it. I totally respect people's rights to do whatever they want with their body so long as they aren't harming others, I'm really just trying to understand the mindset of a bodybuilder, or at least understand what the appeal is.</original_post>

    <text>It's not any more stupid than any art competition. The only difference is the type of canvas being moulded, and the fact that it is masculine oriented due to the nature of the competition involving muscle and physicality.

It may be dangerous, sure, but the drive to be the best, either the best version of yourself, for yourself, or the best in the world, is not necessarily pure vanity. 

There's probably some people who spend time and resources sculpting in marble, and they are very mid. Their sculptures are quite crab, yet they spend money buying raw blocks of marble and have a crack at it, in order to produce an art piece. Doesn't matter if they make no money selling it, doesn't matter if there are people or even machines doing it much better than them. To them, the road for improving their craft is worth it despite the cost. Bodybuilding is similar, and while most people view it as a sport, I see it more like an art form, and through that lens, it makes much more sense than trying to compare bodybuilders to Olympic throwers or sprinters.</text>

It definitely is, you don't have to destroy your health to make music or make paintings</text>

    <text>That depends, plenty of musicians or painters who are obsessed with perfecting their art may engage in plenty of activities that can have negative impact on health, such as:

\- sleep deprivation

\- malnutrition

\- taking drugs such as smoking pot to better connect or get on a higher plane or whatever the hippie jargon is

\- neglect their normal job, therefore reducing their standard of living and not being able to afford better healthcare

and so on. Just because it is not as direct, it doesn't mean that pursuit of other forms of art is not unhealthy healthy. That being said, working out is considered to be healthy in itself, so there might be compensatory mechanisms here.

So sure, you don't have to destroy your health to make music. But you do have to, if you want to be a competitive/professional music producer, these people live under enormous amount of psychological stress and physical stress as a result of being overworked. Similarly, you don't have to destroy your health to be a bodybuilder. But you do, if you want to enter competitive bodybuilding.</text>

    <text>Except you don't need to do any of those things to make music or paint. And no, you don't have to if you want to become a professional music producer. That's just not true at all. 

Becoming a top level bodybuilder literally requires you to do a bunch of PEDs and have an unhealthy body.</text>
