    <title>Women are the inferior gender : CMV</title>
    <original_poster>Lanayru</original_poster>
    <original_post>I know this CMV has been done before (I searched before making this particular submission), but I believe the circumstances in which my sexism has grown are different enough from the other OPs of other similar threads (like user TyKillsTyGoT) to make a new topic that suits my reality better.

I share many of the views held by this user, such as:

    "The smartest people are men. The strongest people are men. It seems like women are average while men can excel or fail spectacularly."

    "I really want to be able to look at women as people but whenever I see a pretty woman in a nice car, I automatically assume someone bought it for her. When I see a woman out shopping, I wonder what her spouse does to afford her these privileges. "

    "The women in my life seem to support this hypothesis. I know some girls who are very smart, but they're not on the level of the smartest guys I know. I also know some girls who are very physically fit but once again they cant compare to the fit men I know and research agrees with both of these points. "

They all pretty much sum up the most prevailing sexist ideas I have.

Now, I should clarify and explain why my reality is different from that of TyKillsTyGoT. I've lived all of my life in a very sexist country, (I'm not from the US, and although I'm sure they have their own issues with sexism, it is, by far, a lot less severe than that which my country has held with such determination) and my parents, siblings and other people close to me have been raised with a sexist ideology. This ideology can vary from the pettiest, smallest things like the situations I listed above, to more serious and aggressive behaviors such as a generalized violence against women in households, or forcing women to stay at home raising kids with no opportunity from their partners to seek financial independence.

I do not share or condone in any way, shape or form the latter. However, I do share a vast majority of the former, and they make me feel really immature, since I know those views aren't objectively true, and are nothing but product of generalization and blunt sexism. In all due honesty, most of the women in this country are not really doing much to change my ideas (I'm not saying that they have to, but rather that their behaviors reinforce all those sexist stereotypes, inevitably so, as we've all been raised inside a sexist nation), by either fitting the stereotypes almost perfectly or using their gender as a mean to get benefits or escape certain situations (such as the "chivarly" most, if not all, of them demand. Personally I think chivarly is based on the idea that women are weaker, and therefore a man must do the hard job for them).

I really want to open my mind and change the view this country has force-fed me with since childhood, so please reddit, CMV.

    <text>Are individuals only quantified by their actions and accomplishments?

Men kill more people and are more likely to kill themselves. Does that make them inferior?

Women have made themselves highly valued in society- doesn't that make them better at survival? How many women do you see living on the streets?

There's a theory on why we have more males at the top of each field. Men have more genetic variation and are more prone to be outliers. You sorta summed this up yourself- you think men have more people who are incredible, but also more who are failures. EDIT: I don't claim this theory to be true, it's more of a hypothesis. Equally possible and probably more of a factor is access to education.

Couldn't we flip this around and say- oh! look women have less people at the bottom- they must be better! Perhaps that is a bit superficial. Regardless, even with this outlier distribution theory trend, the average man is the same as the average woman. If you meet a man and a woman in the street, one is not likely to be smarter than the other.

From a wholly different perspective, maybe we have more male geniuses because men have typically had more exposure to academia? Would the current rise of women in academia (more women in college than man) suggest women are actually smarter? 

I think you need to remove the level of accomplishment from your calculus on human worth. People are people, and are not owed more/less basic human dignity because they went to Harvard or have a rolex or are a man or a woman. They're a person and that's it.

Good luck changing your view man. Wanting to change is often the hardest part.</text>

    <text>One thing about that theory is that men have more incentive to be extraordinary.  They can gain greater amounts of children from greater amounts of risk.

It doesn't mean that those men are biologically superior.  It means that they are just bigger risk takers.</text>

    <text>Yes, this is a good explanation. 

More risk=more reward, but also more failure</text>

How do you construct your aptitude towards people, if not by the results of their past deeds, or results of their WIP? Would you treat a mass murderer as just a person? Because mass murder is nothing else by a result of his choice, no matter how terrible it is compared to our current moral compass.
