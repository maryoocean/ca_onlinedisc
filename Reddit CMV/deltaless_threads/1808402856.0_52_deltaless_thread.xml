    <title>CMV: Fredom of speech is far more important than a few people being offended</title>
    <original_poster>brbrWh0r3</original_poster>
    <original_post>Freedom of speech should be protected and kept, there shouldn't be people arrested for anti trans comments or insulting a soldier/soldiers, or for nazi jokes, or racist remarks or jokes.

Those should all be handled between people, if someone says stuff you dont like you handle it, simply block them or avoid them, theres a whole world you can be in and that persons in a very tiny part of it. 

It makes me nervous seeing people arrested and charged for saying things. It's only leading us to a place where we can be arrested for saying whatever the government doesnt like. And they shouldn't be in that much power to effect our communication with eachother. 

I live in scotland and dont feel I have freedom of speech anymore. 

(For the record I'm a white woman who's bi and have trans thoughts ig for those folks who say it never has been about me, it has sometimes, and in more ways than just those)

Edit: No it's not just anti trans people, Yes I believe crimes other than hate crimes involving speech should be illegal (threatening violence, doxing, defamation) but I also believe insults, jokes and bad takes or thoughts should not be.

Edit 2: Consequences for what is said like losing a job, getting insulted, losing friends ect is totally fine I just dont think the Government should be in charge of what can get you arrested in this sence.

Edit 3: I live in SCOTLAND in the UNITED KINGDOM or in BRITAIN depending what you say, I'm not american, im also not here advocating for my right to be a dick, im just saying the government arent the ones I want saying what I cant say, I mean twitter can destroy lives without them anyway.</original_post>

    <text>take the good with the bad, there will always be both on this fine planet of ours.  Use what you may throw the rest away if you so choose.  Your choice, as options are a good thing.

Conform is the norm now.  Corporate socialism is alive and well (what's the next crisis and money dump etc..), so too is social engineering (question nothing and conform) and big brother syndrome (big everything will protect us won't they, yah right a mess builds a self serving empire what ever happened to small is good simple is smart so the giants don't form demanding more and more power/control etc.. that I fear, the number of giants now a days influencing the puppet show)

Fear them greatly.  I don't fear freedom of speech - say as you will I will merely filter out what I don't deem as useful.  My choice my rights as I see fit.  I don't need big brother to protect my ego etc... (I worked that industry for years, we made a lotta money off of fear, lots).  People need to question things again and research things etc... conform question nothing is the norm now which I fear greatly. (I fear this also [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FjOIqSuhO8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FjOIqSuhO8) )  Walk on eggshells society now.</text>
