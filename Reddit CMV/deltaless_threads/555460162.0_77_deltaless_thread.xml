    <title>CMV: Most people are not well read enough to reasonably advocate for political or economic change</title>

    <original_post>**Edit: "Well read" was a poor choice of words. I think "have done their due diligence" might be more accurate.**

I'm writing this because I want to be proven wrong, because people saying political things, especially as if obvious has started to annoy and anger me more. Especially if they're making fun of someone for their political views, even if I disagree with those views. I hate feeling angry, so hopefully writing my thoughts out will help.

In trying to figure out my own political views, I've come to realize that I can't reasonably hold the views I held, or any other views. I studied economics, mainly the school of thought that appealed to me. But then more and more I came to realize that I couldn't say if the Keynesian or post-keynesian or the Chicago school or MMT etc. were correct, and that even people who devote their lives to the study of economics struggle with the same thing. The same thing happened in philosophy, especially as I came to realize the importance of epistemology and ontology.

And you can't reasonably expect people to put in the effort and time that it takes to sort through these fields. And that there is still such debate among the experts that even if you become and expert, the truth will not be obvious. I've come to understand what Socrates meant when he said something like "I only know that I know nothing".

I've also come to believe that people hold the beliefs they do more for social reasons. Less for the truth of the beliefs, but more because their reaffirm their identity, and their social bonds.

I can't blame them for that, or for not spending thousands of hours sorting through political thought, philosophy and economics. But a part of me still believes that they haven't done their due diligence, and I get angry that they can affirm themselves and their beliefs, while I sit here uncertain, unable to succinctly articulate why, or how to get this across properly.</original_post>

    <text>This is such a gatekeeping view that would result in 90% of the population not participating in government, politics, or economics. And the remaining population that *was* educated enough to participate? It would be old, white, male, rich, and privileged - a complete misrepresentation of our society. 

I would in fact argue the opposite - *everyone* should advocate for political and economic changes regardless of their education level or knowledge.  Politics and economic policy impact every aspect of our lives from our jobs, our money, where we live, how we can express our gender and sexuality, etc. and it’s important that we engage with these things even when we aren’t completely informed - especially if you consider “informed” to mean having studied classic economic theories. Education - especially the high level and extensive education you talk about - is an enormous privilege that will *never* be possible for many people. If we want minority, immigrant, working class, poor, or young voices heard we can’t put conditions on how they engage. 

And haven’t you heard the phrase “practice makes perfect” ? People who engage and advocate for change will learn by *doing*. Have you ever been to a rally or advocating for political reform or pushed a new bill? That process is incredibly educational - you read, you talk to other smart people, you listen to speakers, you watch the news. By discouraging people from engaging until they educate themselves you are - in fact -discouraging them from learning. </text>
