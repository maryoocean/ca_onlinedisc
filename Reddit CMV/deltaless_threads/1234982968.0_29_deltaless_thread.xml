    <title>CMV: When people say "white people can't cook" they're talking about Americans</title>
    <original_poster>picklednood1e</original_poster>
    <original_post>Sorry in advance if I make mistakes, English isn't my native language.  I was born in Eastern Europe and I find it slightly annoying when people of color mock white people by saying that we don't spice our food, that we can't cook, have no culture, etc. I understand that it's mostly jokes and I'm not offended, I even find it funny sometimes, but it still gets me thinking. 

If you look at white people from European countries such as Germany, Ukraine, France, Switzerland, etc. you'll see that we have a very rich culture and amazing meals with alot of flavor. Maybe this is just stereotypes, but from the google research I've done about American traditional (if I can call it that) food, it's pretty much stuff like pb&amp;amp;j sandwiches, pies and alot of precooked/canned meals. But seriously, when I think of a traditional American meal nothing comes to my mind, besides the americanized ethnic foods or fast food.

In general, I find it very annoying when people assume that all white people act like white Americans but it stands out the most when people talk about food and culture.

What do you think about this? Does this even make sense?

Edit: I also wanted to add that I'm not trying to offend anyone! I'm here to educate myself and see other's pov.
Edit: After reading the responses I realized that I didn't know that Americans considered foods from other countries as part of their culture, but it makes sense to me now!</original_post>

    <text>And Ukraine Eastern Europe is the most bland. No spice. Look for Latin countries for food. North Europe is also very bad. And Latin countries are the least white in American ranking. Italy takes top spot. Spain and Portugal too. Romania is more eastern culture. Yeah man borscht isn’t so good or even chicken Kiev and dumplings. You need flavor. French is good for steaks but that’s it.</text>

I think Scandinavian food is better than latin american food. Its obviously an individual thing, so dont call it bad. I gotta admit i got slightly offended. Anyway i just wanted to say i think Europe has the best food.</text>

    <text>South Europe/East Asia/South Asia. But Europe as a whole doesnt have best food. I count Germany also as north europe and poland. Take a look at top cuisine in the world. North europe doesnt not measure up. Tapas, and pasta with pizza. Desserts, french dessert and steaks? yes please</text>
