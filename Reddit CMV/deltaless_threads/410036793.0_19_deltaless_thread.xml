    <title>CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are not ethically superior to standard omnivorous diet</title>
    <original_poster>Kor03d</original_poster>
    <original_post>There is no point in becoming vegan or vegetarian in effort to save animals lives. Suffering or even death of a farm animal are no different to those of a tomato, even if it is harder to emotionally compassionate to the latter, as it is easier for us to relate to animal feelings. You can not exist without ending other creatures life for food, and animal lives are not more important than plants or fungi in that regard.

Please note that does not account for switching diet for own health reasons.

*EDIT: Yes, in my view I consider that plants can suffer even if they don't have the same mechanisms of perception animals do. Jellyfishes don't have a nervous system anywhere close to ours, yet it would still be unethical to cut one in pieces for amusement. Jellyfish would still perceive injury and its normal biological cycles would be hindered. Same goes for plants*

I doubt you actually believe this.  It seems you're just scrambling for arguments against veganism without thinking them through.  

If you saw a guy cutting up a tomato for his own personal amusement (as opposed to making a salad), you'd think he was a bit weird.  If you saw a guy slicing up the limbs of a live dog, you'd be horrified. 

Not trying to be a jerk, but arguments like this are why vegans get so impatient when we debate omnivores.</text>
