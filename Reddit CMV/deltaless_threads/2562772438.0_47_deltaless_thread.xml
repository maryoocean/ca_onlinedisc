    <title>CMV: It is illogical to not believe in Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>LAMARR__44</original_poster>
    <original_post>Many people either believe in Hard Determinism or Compatibilism. I will argue that both are illogical.

Both argue that human actions are extensions of factors we do not have a choice over. Compatibilism seems to say we are still free but just redefines free will to the internal factors behind a decision, but the decision is still decided by a chain of events outside of our control.

My argument is a sort of wager argument. Either libertarian free will exists or it doesn’t. If it exists and we believe in it, we have made a free decision where we are right. If libertarian free will doesn’t exist, the decision to believe in libertarian free will was out of our control.

So either we have a choice and we can make the right choice, or we don’t have a choice and were determined to be wrong.

Thus it makes more sense to believe in libertarian free will since it’s potentially the only one where we have a chance to make a right choice, if determinism is true there is no choice, so there’s no value in being right.</original_post>

    <text>Libertarian free will might be too broad of a claim, as that means you can think and will anything. So you can easily get in to the problem of a god like proposition of "think of something that you can't think of" or will that you will to will something. And most of the time we are controlled by our gut instincts anyway and there's only so much will to resist the urge to eat or shit. So maybe not the all or nothing but still sure either we have free will then we are true assuming so or we don't then we had no choice but to assume it anyway.</text>
