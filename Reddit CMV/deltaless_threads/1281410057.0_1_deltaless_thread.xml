    <title>cmv: Imposing extreme regulatory controls on the stock market would benefit the economy for most people.</title>
    <original_poster>brickses</original_poster>
    <original_post>The fundamental virtue of the stock market to the economy is that it:

* Allows any person to easily invest their wealth in capital ventures for profit (the basis of our capitalist society).
* Efficiently grants the leverage to secure capital to the firms which investors believe have the most propensity to produce value to society.
	
Imposing even the most drastic regulatory constraints on the market would not fundamentally impact these benefits, and would only impact the ability of traders to extract arbitrage out of the market at the expense of other investors.

Liquidity has no significant inherent value to the stock market in terms of it's value to the economy as a whole.

Prohibiting the use of all speculative instruments/derivatives and imposing small per-trade tax would not negatively impact the stock market in it's value to most people, it would reduce the volatility of the market and the likelihood of national or global market events, and if anything it would increase the returns of low risk index funds and value investments.</original_post>

    <text>While I agree that some sort of additional regulations need to be put in place regarding the stock market, "extreme regulatory controls" would not be possible in practicality, at least in the foreseeable future.

As you stated, the goal is to reduce market volatility - but the creation of a significant and extreme set of rules would result in tremendous market volatility as they come into application, as it's impossible to predict how the numerous agents would react to it.

Additionally, a lot of the necessary measure are difficult to enforce - the per-transaction tax, while it would be great to prevent micro-trading, would require global consensus and to be applied everywhere simultaneously, or microtraders could just move to a country without such a tax. That's never going to happen.

Finally, legislation doesn't happen overnight. Creating laws of that magnitude without them being filled with exploitable loopholes is a herculean task, and it would take years to design, with them being killable at every turn by lobbies and propaganda. That would be an extremely high-risk/low reward endeavour for any politician, so that's not gonna happen either.

For all these reasons, we need to focus on smaller-scale changes and focus on one issue at the time. A good first candidate would be prohibiting short sale, as it is in direct contradiction with the second benefit of the free market that you listed, because instead of supporting promising companies it preys on "failing" ones, and is often a self-fulfilling prophecy as big hedge funds have the power to flood the market with virtual stocks they don't own, offsetting the supply/demand balance and resulting in a mechanical loss of value for the stock, that they profit from. Short sale is effectively a way to benefit from the destruction of value and is anathema to the core precepts of capitalism.
It would also be relatively easy to enforce - a government could prevent national companies to be short-sellable, which would protect them against predatory practices, and give them an advantage over other countries, rather than seeing a risk of capital being diverted to other countries that a lot of other measures might result in.
It is also easily justifiable politically, as it seems completely natural that it should be impossible to sell something you don't own.</text>

    <text>Of course I grant that implementation of drastic change would cause short term volatility. Laws can be written to implement changes in stages over time to reduce volatility.

My main opinion that I am looking for criticism on is that the steady state would be a preferable status-quo.

If these changes were implemented synchronously globally with no negative short term consequences due to the transition would there be a long term economic benefit to the average person?

If they were not implemented everywhere synchronously, would the  exodus of capital have major negative consequences outside of the collapse of a financial sector which in my view is parasitic? I understand that a reduction in the share price of a single stock relative to the rest of the market will reduce that firm's ability to acquire capital, but shouldn't a simultaneous reduction in share value across the market with no change to labor, supply, demand or capital have no impact on GDP or employment.

What does it impact me what country rich people do their gambling in?</text>
