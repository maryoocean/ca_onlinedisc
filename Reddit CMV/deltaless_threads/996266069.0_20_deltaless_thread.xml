    <title>CMV: There is no reason a “God” should give Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>Protagoras67</original_poster>
    <original_post>I want to disclose that I am both an atheist and a hard determinist. I do not believe in any sort of creator and I have a hard time believing in Free Will. From what I understand from a Christian perspective, God gives humans free will in an effort to test them. But what i don’t understand from their point of view is why would God do that in the first place? Isn’t God omnipotent? God could just design the universe however it wants, we could have all been programmed to behave a certain way from birth and believe in God from birth and follow one religion as opposed to having a myriad of them. There is no reason to test us, it’s completely unnecessary.

Again, I’m not challenging anyone to prove God exists, I am just trying to understand the theological logic of this.</original_post>

    <text>I think an important aspect of the nature of God has to be factored in, in order to better appreciate this question - namely His holiness / moral perfection.  How else can that be demonstrated but by creating moral agents in which they're held accountable?

As a side note - existentially speaking, can you really grasp the magnitude of the fact you are a conscious being in a world not by your choice?

There are a plethora of variables in your life you had no say in, let alone the choice to even exist in the first place.</text>
