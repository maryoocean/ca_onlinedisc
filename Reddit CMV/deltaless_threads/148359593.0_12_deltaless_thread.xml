    <title>CMV: The West should recolonize the Middle East.</title>
    <original_poster>ThrownOutToday</original_poster>
    <original_post>It's probably not a healthy view or a popular one, but with the rise of ISIS I find myself thinking that the middle east has had 100 years to decide who they as a culture want to be. Now we have sayings like "that will happen as soon as there is peace in the middle east" to say something is impossible. I'm struggling with racist tendencies. Racist might not be the right word, maybe its a combination of theologism(I don't think that's a word, but you know that I mean) and racism. I understand that not all Arabic Muslims want my head on a platter, but enough do to constantly have struggles over there. With the release of this newest beheading, I think we need to basically recolonize the middle east. We divide up the countries from Turkey to Iraq, which then means we have a solid oil source not dependent on Russia, Palestine and Israel are forced to share space and live peacefully, "radical Islam" is for the most part stamped out and frowned upon, and the young people of those states can now grow up in a stabilized home where they can develop other skills besides learning guerrilla warfare. The only downside I see with this is Russia stepping in, but I'm sure there is a solution to be found. </original_post>

    <text>Arranging things in the area to suit the agendas and resolve the conflicts of imperial powers is a significant reason why the Middle East is how it is today. States were created that hadn't gone through the difficult and often ugly process of state formation and still haven't gotten all the way through that to this day, resulting in many states that only ever had any stability under strict monarchies or dictatorships that brutally keep any dissent under control - and that strategy, as we've seen, has limits. I don't think that the public in Western democracies are willing to try to take over where Saddam Hussein or Bashar Assad left off either. Policy is going to have to revolve around trying to limit the damage there and elsewhere as the Middle East finally gets to go through the process of sorting itself out.</text>
