    <title>CMV: It's stupid to care about the environment in space.</title>
    <original_poster>MostRecommendation84</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm a big proponent of space colonization/exploitation and every time I bring it up there's someone who says something along the lines of "Oh we're gonna trash the Moon like we did Earth?" "Oh good more mining!" "Humanity won't rest until we've exploited everything we can!" and other snide comments to that effect. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Honestly, it just sounds like the dumbest argument to me and I wouldn't even be bothering with a CMV if I hadn't heard it so many times. *It's rocks. Uninhabitable barren rocks floating through vast chunks of literally* ***nothing****.* There's no space squirrels to worry about, we haven't found any aliens and we really have no reason to assume any are out there, let alone that they give a shit what we do to Mercury. Furthermore, you want to stop desertification or the human rights violations of cobalt mining, you're gonna be hard pressed to find a better solution than the absurd volumes of water and cobalt from here to the asteroid belt.</original_post>

    <text>Space debris is a serious issue.  You can't just leave a ton of "junk" floating around without putting any sort of space travel at serious risk.  And no you can't just launch it off in some random direction because you'd have to actually fire it off at greater than the solar system's orbital escape velocity on order for it to not just end up right back in your orbital path again.    


So yes, Mine the moon, mine other planets whatever but don't take big rocks floating in space and turn them into a million tiny rocks floating in space.  That's a really bad idea.</text>
