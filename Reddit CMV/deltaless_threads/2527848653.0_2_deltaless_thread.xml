    <title>CMV: Advocacy should be priorized over Objectivity in the Free press</title>
    <original_poster>anonymous68856775</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have heard many people talking about how the job of the press is to remain objective, giving the truth to let the citizens decide for themselves what to believe. However, I believe the opposite. 

First of all, I define Advocacy as a genre of journalism that combines reporting with a point of view, allowing for the writer to express their opinion. Objective reporting is trying to report on facts without distortion.

One of the major purposes of a free press is to be able to articulate criticism is to utilize that power to hold democratic powers accountable. In order for a democracy to function effectively, the ability and persistence of criticism is absolutely necessary. Therefore, the press has a duty not simply to inform, but to take a stance on given issues, allowing Amercians to be exposed to a myriad of opinions, and hold their government accountable. 

Prioritizing advocacy in media reporting and journalism plays a crucial role in protecting human rights by giving a voice to those being harmed and also alerts the audience to injustices. Advocacy transforms a reporter from a mere communicator of information into a motivator for action, allowing for human rights to be upheld. 

An example can be seen in early America. Columbia Journalism review [explains](https://archives.cjr.org/feature/rethinking_objectivity.php) that in the attempt to be objective about lynchings, news sources would cover the murder of a man by the mob, and also cover the reason for the mob’s murder. They wouldn’t mention that lynching was immoral, they simply gave reasons for and against. They then go even further, citing a book on objectivity in the press, “Mindich shows how “objective” coverage of lynching in the 1890s by The New York Times and other papers created a false balance on the issue and failed “to recognize a truth, that African-Americans were being terrorized across the nation.

Objectivity can only tell us what is happening - Advocacy lobbies to fix the issue. If someone is stealing a car, merely observing that fact is not enough. Advocacy is crucial to change.

I wonder if there is something wrong in my logic somewhere, or if there is some benefit of objectivity that haven't found yet.

    <text>I would argue that you cannot be objective. That such a thing doesn't exist in journalism and it's always been this way. 

All journalism, by simply covering one thing or another by DOING journalism you're acting as advocate whether that is explicit, implicit, conscious or subconscious. 

Editors by allowing or not allowing stories, making changes or limiting the number of stories on a certain subject is advocacy for a certain worldview.</text>

    <text>People still try to prioitize objectivity. An example of this is the New York News Publishers Association, which [says](https://nynpa.com/docs/nie/newsmedia/FactvsOpinion.pdf) :A writer’s opinion should not appear in a news article and pro-fessional journalists make every effort to write news objectively.”</text>

    <text>Sure, people can try to breathe underwater or jump to mars. It doesn't mean they're going to. 

they way this is written still lines up with the view that objectivity doesn't exist

&gt;A writer’s opinion should not appear in a news article and pro-fessional journalists make every effort to write news objectively.

your opinion should not APPEAR in a news article, journalists should make every EFFORT to write news objectively

meaning you should try to maintain the appearance of objectivity as it makes you appear trustworthy, just because someone can't see your bias doesn't mean it doesn't exist 

all the things I mention, choosing to write in the first place, word choice, editor's decisions, the people you cite and the people you don't etc all work towards your implicit bias but it's best practice to try and appear objective as it will get you more viewership</text>

    <text>This was more of a philosophical idea, that writers should be free to express their opinion and not write hidden bias into the article that is presented as fact. I'm sure that the New York News Publishers Association actually believes that they are writing the facts. If they weren't why would they intentionally include this section?</text>

    <text>This is tried but just because you will fall short of that goal doesn't mean you won't make things better by trying.

A good journalist is humble enough to admit he may not be right, and he wants other people to have all the information so they can be informed.  Telling people how to interpret that info is not a journalists job. 

Also gatekeeping which is the industry term for editors selecting stories that push a certain narrative is destructive to credibility. 

An editor should seek information that disproves his point of view just as strongly as the information that supports it.

To deliberately not try and be objective is nothing but propaganda.</text>
