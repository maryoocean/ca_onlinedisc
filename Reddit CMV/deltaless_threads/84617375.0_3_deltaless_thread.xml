    <title>If I met a girl on the internet and struck up a relationship, I would make up an elaborate lie about how we met so people would believe we met 'offline'. CMV.</title>

    <text>&amp;gt; but I still don't think I could say 'we met online'.

Why not? I dated a girl that I met online for almost 4 years, and we never hid the fact that we met online. People did find it "interesting" but I've never witnessed any "stigma" *against* it.</text>
