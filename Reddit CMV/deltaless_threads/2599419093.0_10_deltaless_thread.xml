    <title>CMV: the way that conservatives have got in line behind Trump shows that they never really believed in anything in the first place, apart from belonging to a tribe and beating the other tribe.</title>

    <original_post>As things stand, Trump has already been chosen as a presidential candidate once and is massively in the lead to be chosen again. Yet he seems to go against traditional conservative values in so many respects. 

* Family values: he's a known adulterer, "grab 'em by the pussy" etc.
* Religion: clownishly ignorant about the Bible
* Managerial competence: ignorant of basic facts about world and US affairs
* Honest dealing: on his own admission he's exploited bankruptcy rules several times to get out of debts. And where are the tax returns?
* Promises kept: where's the money from Mexico for the wall? Where's the "beautiful" healthcare plan that we were promised?
* Decorum: I don't think I need to say much about this one. Belittling, name-calling, tantrums, the list goes on.
* Democracy: "if I lose then it was rigged". This is probably the biggest of them all. 

I understand that some conservatives have distanced themselves. But the majority of the GOP seems to be behind him. What explains this, except for wanting to feel like you're in the in-group, and wanting to own the stupid libs?</original_post>

    <text>Conservatives have had a silent message for quite some time.  Trump picked it up and started saying it out loud.  They all talked about the immigration problem.  Trump claims that when Mexico sends its people, etc.   Conservatives loved to talk about corruption and how the elite Washington was taking advantage.  He said it was rigged because he bought the politicians and cheated on taxes.    
       
     
He is open about his race baiting and conspiracies and disdain for the government because it is the quiet part conservatives have been hinting.    It's all out now, and no one knows how to make it stop.</text>
