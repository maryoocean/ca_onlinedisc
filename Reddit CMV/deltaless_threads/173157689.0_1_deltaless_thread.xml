    <title>CMV:The media turns us into what we consume</title>
    <original_poster>ExploreMeDora</original_poster>
    <original_post>Marshall McLuhan coined the term "the medium is the message." This means that the form of a medium (cell phone vs newspaper) embeds itself in the message, creating a symbiotic relationship by which the medium influences how the message is perceived. McLuhan proposes that a medium itself, not the content it carries, should be the focus of study. He said that a medium affects the society in which it plays a role not only by the content delivered over the medium, but also by the characteristics of the medium itself.


With this concept in mind I ask that you challenge these statements:


1. Reading print media makes us more educated, as opposed to the digital media we revel in today.
2. Playing violent video games and watching violent films makes us more violent.
3. Watching television makes us less social.
4. Life online gives us popcorn brain.


Popcorn brain can be defined as a brain so accustomed to the constant stimulation of electronic multitasking that it becomes unfit for life offline, where things pop at a slower pace.


I welcome you to come up with other statements to challenge or to develop other counterarguments. Essentially, I believe that our media consumption strongly affects our identity.

The four numbered statements, do you hold those views? /r/changemyview isn't a place where users will agree with the OP, but the opposite; it's a place where OP's views are challenged and hopefully changed. </text>

    <text>Yes! I came up with those statements as examples of how the media turns us into what we consume. I want people to challenge these ideas and prove to me that the media does not turn us into what we consume. Attacking those four statements is obviously a way to start.</text>

    <text>Could you clarify what you mean by 'the media turns us into what we consume'? Are you just essentially saying that you agree that McLuhan's thesis is correct, or that we consume content e.g. sensaltionalistic news segments, violent videogames, etc, in ways that change our society? I just want to be clear on exactly what view you're looking to have changed.</text>

    <text>I believe that the media and the changing medium in which it is presented (televised news, tweets on our phone, violence in video games) is changing society as a whole and we are all examples of this.</text>
