    <title>CMV: Alpha males are actually 95 percent beta</title>

    <original_post>The others are human traffickers internet celebrities.  
I really don't believe this bullshit. I made a lot of observations in the military and people don't fit these patterns. The reason I'm writing this is because they contradict what they made up. they're all going after a few "alphas". but speaking by their rules, one alpha never follows another alpha. For example, andrew tat. This guy has millions of followers. most of them are men. others are probably female simps. now, if they are all alpha then what are all these alphas doing together? Why are alphas praising or defending andrew tate on the internet? All I see is adolescents who have not become individuals, have chosen a "male" role model for themselves from the internet. or, in their language, the alpha male gathered all betas around him.  
 just it. speaking by the book, an alpha never follows another alpha, when an alpha sees another alpha, he prepares for a fight. there is only one alpha in a group, there is no such thing as an assistant alpha. There are only loyal betas who take advantage of alpha. But, as far as I can see, these aren't even beta. fanboys only.  
Another contradiction (paradox?) "sigmas". I'll cut it short. why would a sigma have discussions with anonymous people on the internet about being sigma?   
Imagine that: Kai, the most famous sigma (who is a beyblade character, not kpop) is watching videos of the his sigma brothers to be cool (or make a girl). do you think this makes sense?</original_post>

    <text>Men fall on a curve. There are certain percentage of "alpha" of the whole population. Do you agree?

Now I don't know all the "alpha male" rules and are not a bro-code lawyer but I assume that normal people don't qualify as "alpha". You know if you were "an alpha" and most likely make it known. There are no "silent alpha" just chilling and living their lives in obscurity.

We also know that self-identified "alpha males" make up really small percentage of whole population.

And here we come to conclusion. If all "alphas" are vocal, they make up only small percentage and there are only few vocal "alphas", then they all must be "alphas".

We just have to accept that all these people are "alphas" and that "alpha" means loud, misogynistic, sexist jerk. Or you should treat "alphas" like computer program alpha builds. They are unfinnished, unpolished, buggy messes that are not ready for public use.</text>
