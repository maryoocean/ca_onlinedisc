    <title>CMV: I have no problem with the TSA and would honestly feel less safe if there wasn't the extensive searches</title>
    <original_poster>damienrapp98</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have never felt unsafe on an airplane. I used to have some fears related to them but those were mainly due to fear of turbulence and such, not terrorism. I think that this is mainly due to the TSA's policies. It's damn near impossible to bring any dangerous devices onto a plane.

I will disclose this. I was born in 1998 (17 years old). That means that I don't remember 9/11 (I remember that day, but not the significance) and I don't remember life before the TSA's newer policies. I grew up with them.

I just feel like the extra 30 minutes it takes to go through security is no big deal and generally gives me peace of mind. I totally understand minority complaints and I'm not arguing about those at all, but what I am saying is that the general (neither expedited or extended) search is totally reasonable and generally I don't feel annoyed or like my rights have been taken away in any sort of way.

    <text>Its a false sense of security you have. The TSA has not managed to stop or prevent a single incidence of terrorism. They have a better than 95% failure rate. They have allowed violent criminals access to secure areas of the airports because of their ineptitude and lack of oversight. You are literally NO SAFER thanks to them. It is your imagination. At the same time as they've proven themselves to be an abject failure, they've also racked up an impressive number of violations, including abusing passengers, denying medical attention, harassment (both sexual and non-sexual), theft, and more. So, you may FEEL you're more safe, but in REALITY, you are not. </text>
