    <title>CMV: If gender is a social construct, then so is race</title>
    <original_poster>BoppeBoye</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let us take, as a given, that gender is divorced from the circumstances of your birth, that it is not a mental illness, and that there is no biological basis for what gender identity someone should express. Have I phrased that effectively? I'm trying to be concise, but I want to portray that premise correctly.

Why, then, should race be different than gender? If race carries with it "shared experience" and "lived experience", etc - that assumes that the only way you could understand what it's like to be a minority is to have lived your entire life as that particular minority. I'm not arguing against that, I agree that there are certain experiences that I could not comprehend - for instance, overbearing &amp;amp; strict Asian parents with exceedingly high expectations. 

But, if someone can change their gender or decide (?) that they identify as a different gender without having the prior lived experience of said gender, then why can't someone identify as a different race?

I'm not able to encompass all the variables which could lead someone to identify as another gender, but is it not possible for someone to come to the same conclusion with their race? What if an Indian man grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood, saw or experienced the same (or similar) discrimination as them, had minimal exposure to Indian culture; and this led him to conclude that he identifies more closely as a black man, rather than Indian? 

I would also like to cite Rachel Dolezal, who was uniformly mocked for being (afaik) the first trans-black woman in the public eye. It seems similar to transgender discrimination to me, assuming that there is something wrong with her mentally for deciding to become a black woman... Anyway, I'm not really defending her because that's not really in line with what I described in the previous paragraph (she grew up privileged IIRC), but the public reaction of mockery goes against the leftist belief of acceptance, by my perspective.

So, in short, why can there be no such thing as trans-racial people, the same way there are transgender?

No, I don't think you have (no offense). I think you are wildly mixing a variety of ideas here, and you may need to slow down and clarify each point.
"Gender" is not a mental illness, and nobody says it is: you might be confusing "gender" with "gender dysphoria". 

There *is* a biological component to gender, but this does not mean that gender is not a social construct. I feel like you are working within a false dichotomy (either gender has nothing to do with your biology, or it is entirely based on biology). 

The truth is more nuanced: even though "gender" is a social construct, it has a strong biological component. Think of the term "masculine", for example. Most people would agree that what is "masculine" is generally defined by society (Are suits and ties masculine? Are some haircuts more masculine than others? Is painting your nails masculine?), and yet it is also true that many masculine traits are determined and clustered by biology (facial hair, muscle growth, etc).</text>
