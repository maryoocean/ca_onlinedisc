    <original_post>Homosexuality is not natural, and neither is heterosexuality

There is no such thing as attraction in other mammal species, just the male raping the female and reproducing. 

Attraction in humans is a social construct. It's a way to soothe people or to bond similar to how bonobos do it.

Because us humans have “the instinctive need to produce offspring,” the sheer fact that men want to have PiV sex with women just for fun or without wanting kids, proves it's not a natural attraction.

Plus, most women don't care about being penetrated. It doesn't feel good for us, clitoral stimulation is a need for most. PiV sex has no purpose outside of getting pregnant. Sexual relationships are not necessary at all.</original_post>

    <text>That's just not true. Unless you do not believe in theory of evolution.

A trait of sexual attraction would be like the most dominating one in natural selection of all species.</text>

    <text>I know that our society has evolved. We are complex. But it is still not natural and our distant species’ relatives literally do not care about any of that</text>

    <text>Natural selection implies that traits that lead to the most offspring will be favored the most. 

An animal having no sexual attraction vs the one that has, will be less likely to produce offspring, and therefore, continue this trait.

You are claiming that male mammal basically rapes the female mammal. Have you ever seen female dog or cat "in heat"? That's the work of natural selection for you. They are more likely to mate and produce offspring.</text>
