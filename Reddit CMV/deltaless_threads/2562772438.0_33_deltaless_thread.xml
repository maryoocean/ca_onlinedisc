    <title>CMV: It is illogical to not believe in Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>LAMARR__44</original_poster>
    <original_post>Many people either believe in Hard Determinism or Compatibilism. I will argue that both are illogical.

Both argue that human actions are extensions of factors we do not have a choice over. Compatibilism seems to say we are still free but just redefines free will to the internal factors behind a decision, but the decision is still decided by a chain of events outside of our control.

My argument is a sort of wager argument. Either libertarian free will exists or it doesn’t. If it exists and we believe in it, we have made a free decision where we are right. If libertarian free will doesn’t exist, the decision to believe in libertarian free will was out of our control.

So either we have a choice and we can make the right choice, or we don’t have a choice and were determined to be wrong.

Thus it makes more sense to believe in libertarian free will since it’s potentially the only one where we have a chance to make a right choice, if determinism is true there is no choice, so there’s no value in being right.</original_post>

    <text>You can have the illusion of free will, and feel like you believe x. I mean at some point it's just semantics. We have free will in the sense that we act on our thoughts (we also act on our instincts though). We don't necessarily have free will in the sense that we decide what to think about. We are always influenced.

One obvious proof against free will is that a thought is generated by a brain seven seconds before we're consciously thinking it. That can't be compatible with free will, unless we decide that any thought fired by our own brain is literally just us thinking it. That's where semantics (and a bit of philosophy) comes in.

But we can still believe that free will doesn't exist and be right. We might not have chosen to believe in the very basic sense, but for all intents and purposes, we came to our own conclusions.</text>
