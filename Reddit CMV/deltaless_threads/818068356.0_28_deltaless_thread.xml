    <title>CMV: There is no good reason to leave a note on a comment after editing it for typos</title>
    <original_poster>wscuraiii</original_poster>
    <original_post>Is this some aspect of internet etiquette I missed out on at internet school? 

Too often, I'll be scrolling through comments on Reddit, and come across one with a footnote that reads:

EDIT: typos

Or even worse:

EDIT: a word

I understand and support leaving edit notes for developing stories or when *content* needs to be corrected after the fact. That makes sense.  But spelling? Seriously? When you turn in an essay or publish an article you wouldn't leave a footnote saying:

[1] All spelling errors have been corrected.

Who cares if you proofread your work? Why is that so special it deserves a footnote? Correct your typos and move on. You're *supposed* to proofread your work. It's assumed we all try to do so. Everyone makes typos, especially today when so many people are typing on mobile devices. I wrote this entire post using swipe text, for example. I'll be absolutely stunned if I don't find a few awkward typos in here. But I certainly won't let everybody know I corrected them. Because assuming I found them, of course I did. 

That's my view. Am I just uneducated? Is there something I missed? I've been meaning to make this post for a while now but kept forgetting, until I saw the "I fixed my typos" edit in three different comments today. I'm just trying to understand what the thought process could possibly be. 

EDIT: Did not find any typos, so none were corrected. Stunned.

EDIT 2, ELECTRIC BOOGALOO: Thanks for the silver, anonymous stranger!</original_post>

    <text>What most commenters seem to be missing out on in their responses here is that according to [official reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) you're supposed to state your reasons for editing a post or comment</text>

    <text>This is the best answer to the question, IMO - "yes, it is etiquette you missed - it's the official etiquette of *this website*".

The reasons for the approach make sense and support its use, of course, but OP's view is clearly based out of ignorance of the specific official conventions of the website.</text>

    <text>Still kinda stupid that they do not improve their edit function if itâ€™s literally a part of the etiquette of this website. Like allow us to see older comment version &amp;amp; after editing a comment, there will be a small box where you type your reason for editing and it will show up in the corner or something</text>

    <text>I can't say I disagree. If you want someone to do something a certain way in your software, don't rely on your user - make your software itself support the approach you want.

My comment was really just pointing out that 'yes, you have missed something - [link]' is basically enough to - illustrate the flaw in OPs original thesis.</text>
