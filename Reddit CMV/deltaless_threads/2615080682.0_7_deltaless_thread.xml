    <title>CMV: Taylor Swift is the best artist of the 21st century and is on track to become the best artist of all time.</title>

    <original_post>Note that here, “best” means most popular, most successful, most famous, etc. I am in no way saying that her music is the objective best music to listen to or anything like that.

Taylor Swift is a cultural phenomenon. Yes, her music is stereotypical “basic white girl music” (which is a problematic belief that many hold that I won’t get into here), but way too many people deny that she’s an all-time great just to be controversial, quirky, different, etc.

[Here is a quick list of her awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Taylor_Swift)

In addition to those, she has been on top of Billboard Artist 100 for **81 weeks**. She is the only artist to take up **every single spot** on the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time. She has multiple songs (Love Story, You Belong With Me, Shake it Off, We Are Never Getting Back Together) that have stood the test of time for a decade and will likely be classics at least on the level of songs like Hey Jude, or even We Will Rock You.

Furthermore, the Eras Tour is arguably already the most famous concert tour ever. Going by current numbers it will absolutely demolish the record for highest grossing concert tour, which was set by Elton John’s Farewell Yellow Brick Road. And it’ll do so with just 1/3 the number of concerts.

Just look at the NFL. Their Twitter account changed their profile picture, bio, and banner just because Taylor Swift showed up to a Chiefs game. To have that level of influence over the most popular sports league in the United States is insane.

Yes, I’m a big fan of her work. But even objectively speaking, I don’t see how anyone can deny that, when she does retire, she will be one of the greatest artists to ever live, just in terms of objective popularity.

And just to directly address the claims made in my title—I for one cannot name any artist with more name recognition in the 20th century. “Taylor Swift” is, at this point, used as the default name-drop for “stereotypically popular singer”. And her current level of popularity/fame is on par with any great artist (say, for example, the Beatles or Michael Jackson) at their peak, which is why I think she has a shot at becoming #1 all time.</original_post>

    <text>You've caveated this right into the ground. If you get to decide what 'best' means by setting and weighting the criteria, then you can pick whomever you want to 'win'. So if those are your measurements, sure, there's nothing to disprove. What happens if someone makes more money than her? Is a little okay? How much does it take to dethrone her? There's no math so there's nothing to prove. What is the relative value of the NFL changing their profile vs. record sales.

You like her, that's fine, and she's doing super well. What are we trying to sort out here?

Additionally I think a lot of people would argue that the criteria you have put forward are either not relevant in a conversation about 'best', or actively prove that she isn't. Popularity is frequently the enemy of good. Go ahead and tell me that a Big Mac is the best available hamburger.

The word you want is 'popular' or 'successful' in which case show your work (which you kind of have) and then, yeah, probably you're right.</text>

    <text>This right here is likely the best argument.  There's not a lot to argue because they haven't really provided any space for argument.</text>
