    <title>CMV: Impeaching Donald Trump is actually not a very good idea</title>
    <original_poster>Shanghai1943</original_poster>
    <original_post>Congress and the DOJ are investigating the collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government in the 2016 Russian election. Robert Muller has been appointed as special counsel to investigate this matter, and today he has [impaneled a grand jury.](http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-grand-jury-robert-mueller-trump-russia-2017-8). Which could ultimately result in the impeachment of Donald Trump.        

For the most part since the Trump presidency, Vice President Mike Pence has been kept away from the spotlight. This may be a move by the party in the case of an impeachment that the new president would start from a clean slate. Although Pence is a much much more presentable president for America, he serves a similar agenda to Donald Trump and the current Republican leadership, not to mention he has a very poor track record on abortion, LGBT rights, climate change, education, among others.       

In the case of a Trump impeachment, Mike Pence becomes the new president. In my view, he is just a more competent version of Donald Trump that is presentable to the public, but at the same time perhaps much better than Trump at pushing the same type of Republican backed bills through congress. Lets not forget that the skinny repeal was only 1 vote short from passing.        

America might look silly with Trump as the president, this is manly due to his personality and unstable nature. But because of his unstable nature, people in congress, even in his party bound to oppose him. In the 6 months he has been president, he has gotten almost nothing done. Since Trump has been so awful, all Pence has to do is a little good and he would seem like a saint, which would prolong the Republican run, and at the current state of Republican leadership, this is no good. Thus in my view, keeping an idiot running things for the next 3.5 years would be better for America in the long run than putting Mike Pence in the driver's seat as he is just a more competent Donald Trump.

Edit: Thanks guys, my views have been changed, I have ignored his foreign policies in this thread as well as the precedence he sets if we accept his behavior.

    <text>There are two ways to look at the possible impeachment process of Donald Trump:

1)  As a political opponent, motivated by partisan reasons.  In this case, it is definitely a negative that Pence would take over, but the sheer political damage of a Trump impeachment would stain him and the GOP.  They would lose elections.  The damage to the Republican party from an impeachment would ensure that democrats make major gains over the next few years.  The stability provided by forgoing an impeachment means that in the eye of voters, Trump (and the GOP) are absolved, and incumbents usually win elections.  Abandoning the investigation would be a huge boon to the Republicans ability to stay in office.

2)  As an individual who believes that crimes were committed, and should be punished.  Justice is blind to partisan desires, it doesn't matter what the political implications might be.  It is *figuratively* criminal to let a crime go unrecognized because you don't like someone's politics.</text>
