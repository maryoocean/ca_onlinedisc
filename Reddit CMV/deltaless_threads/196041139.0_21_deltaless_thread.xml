    <title>CMV: "White trash" is an offensive slur, and should not be tolerated in society just as we do not tolerate other bigoted slurs.</title>
    <original_poster>JSmurfington</original_poster>
    <original_post>This has bothered me for a while. The term "white trash" or "trailer trash" fits all the criteria for being a slur which should not be widely acceptable for use. But I have heard the term dropped casually in conversation, and no one seems to treat it like the slur that it is.

It is a term that denigrates and stereotypes a group of people based on their race, appearance, and socioeconomic status. It is meant to be derogatory. This to me is the definition of a bigoted term.

I'm not arguing that the term has as much history behind it as other racial or bigoted slurs. But in our modern society, we should still abandon the term altogether.

    <text>Eh. The term itself precludes it from being a racial epitaph in that it separates one group of whites from the rest of them. The speaker is by the very nature of the phrase itself saying that that person is less than an "average" white person.

Is it a slur? Absolutely. It's meant to be. So are a thousand other phrases we use every day like "idiot", "asshole" or "moron". </text>
