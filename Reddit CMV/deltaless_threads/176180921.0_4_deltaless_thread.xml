    <title>CMV: I think atheism is the better path than religion, as it can cause less conflicts</title>
    <original_poster>theraiderofreddit</original_poster>
    <original_post>Today, the world is filled with conflicts between religious groups. People rush to defend their religion, and think of other's religion as inferior. People are fighting wars sorely on the basis of religion, and the recent Charlie Hebdo massacre was done on the grounds of religion.

I am here with an alternate proposal: That of no religion at all, aka atheism. Of course, I don't mean eradication of Religion. That would be impossible. I am just saying that a world without religion would be a world with less conflicts.

One may pose the argument that the institution of religion unites people under a single umbrella, but that ship has passed. There are too many sects, too many divisions too many views for this to be effective. If one is not driven by religion, there would be less chances of conflicts. I don't mean no conflicts at all. 

Conflicts are bound to happen, but religious conflicts are one of the major factors. So why not remove religion from the equation and unlock a more peaceful world?</original_post>

    <text>The 20th century was the bloodiest we've had so far and it mostly came from political alliances and beliefs, not from religious wars. People will always find reasons to hate each other. We evolved as a tribal species, so we are naturally inclined to think of things in terms of us versus them. Changing thought patterns won't change what we are at the core, so there will always be conflict as long as humans exist on a scale like this. </text>

    <text>That's an interesting point of view. Though, I would like to reiterate what I said. Such desires exist whether or not religion exists. But, religion actually motivates people to do these things, as another commenter has pointed out. Without religion, the number of conflicts can reduce.

    <text>It's a good case to be made, but the real core of human conflict is at our population size. Wars have always been bloody, but they went haywire in the 20th century when the population exploded. Not only was religion not the main theme for the World Wars, Vietnam War, or the Cold War, but you could also say that war is driven by limited land resources versus the population. People invade others because they need stuff for their own people. That's something that goes to an even baser level than our religious beliefs as a whole. Conflict solution could be focused more on population control than thought "control."</text>

    <text>Resources are part of it but let's not ignore the fact that ideology was also a significant part of it. Hitler had no racial qualms with England for instance, he actually hoped they would adopt Nazism, but because of political and ideological hatred of Fascism they didn't. Resources may have been part of the cause of expansion initially but ideology was key in escalating it to a world war.</text>

    <text>I don't disagree that ideology was a factor. OP was arguing that absence of religion means less conflict, so I was trying to provide examples of other reasons people could kill one another.</text>

    <text>Yes if course, although I think OP did state that he didn't believe religion was the ONLY cause of violence, he just believed that it was a cause which warranted its removal from society.</text>

    <text>In my view there are bigger factors than religion, so its removal wouldn't change much when it comes to conflict.</text>

    <text>Just because it is not the biggest, doesn't mean it wouldn't have an impact. Yes, people might be able to justify conflicts, but they would have to search for a different reason.

If we agree that religion is used as propaganda and not the *actual* reason, we still have to ask *why* it was used instead of the actual reason. Did the perpetrators find it easier to use religion to sway people than other causes? If so, removing that "easy tie-in" might slow such developments or prevent them from happening in the first place.</text>

    <text>You wouldn't really have to look far. You can divide people on borders, class, race, politics, hell I'd argue that politics is something people cling to more than they do religion, but it's kind of a stretch to suggest that we can just remove political thinking from people. Even irreligious thinkers found reasons to fight, so it's not like they are pure-hearted, or society is any better off. Maybe if everyone was atheist, there would be less fighting, but that's like saying everyone should be [X] political view. Plus you could also take the opposite stance and say everyone should be christian, or muslim, but we all know those sects have fought each other despite being like-minded. </text>

    <text>Yes but it might change it enough to be preferable to having religion, also there might be other negative factors aside from just conflict.</text>

    <text>Religion is seldom the cause of violence. It is however a tool used by those in power to get the populace to act in violence. </text>

    <text>I think that is actually a more simplistic view of things which has become quite popular recently. People can be very motivated by what they believe in, if that is expressed in the form of religion it can easily lead to violence.</text>

    <text>Stalin had around 50 million people killed while he was in power and he certainly didn't need religion to do so.</text>
