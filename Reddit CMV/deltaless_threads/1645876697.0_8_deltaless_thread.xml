    <title>CMV: Altered Carbon S2 was good on it’s own, just not as a continuation of S1. It would have had better reviews if it had been presented as a separate, tangential show. SPOILER</title>

    <original_post>The main issue with the second season of Altered Carbon was the fact that the majority of the main cast were gone, and or had less screen time, and were played by different actors (riding different sleeves). The one constant was Poe, as he’s an AI, and had no physical embodiment, and was beloved by many, he had significantly more screen time. 


The reason Takeshi Kovacs was in a different sleeve was actually explained, at the end of the last episode, he had cleared Ryker of the charges he was framed for and Ryker would be spun back up and want his sleeve back which Takeshi was riding. 


People had become attached to Joel Kinnaman and his performance of Takeshi Kovacs, and didn’t like the sudden change to him being portrayed by a totally different actor. Anthony Mackie did a good job, and the second series was good in it’s own right, people just didn’t like the change from season one.


However, the nature of the show, the ability to avoid real death by having your consciousness (DHF) stored in a stack and resleeved into a new body kind of made this aspect unique and predictable.

    <text>Anthony Mackie did *not* do a good job. He was wooden and soft and felt absolutely nothing like the same person in a different body. I suppose that his love interest being reintroduced as a character in the current timeline would make him act differently, but that was too jarring when you combine it with the fact that Mackie never felt like Kovacs in the first place.</text>

This exactly. The recasting makes perfect sense in the context of the show, it's basically the perfect setup for it, but that shouldn't change the personality and mannerisms of the character.

In the context of S2 being a totally new show, the acting quality simply doesn't hold up.</text>
