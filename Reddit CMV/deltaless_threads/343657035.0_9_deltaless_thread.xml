    <title>CMV: U.S. Expenditures on defense is why there is so few terrorist attacks</title>
    <original_poster>KS1867</original_poster>
    <original_post>On Reddit the U.S. gets a lot of flak for spending so much on its defense budget. People often use the argument "[some uncommon event] kills more people a year than terrorists." I argue that this is because of our massive intelligence and military capabilities. Another hot button issue on Reddit seems to be the use of drones and many will argue that our drone program makes more enemies than it kills. Although I do recognize the flaws with our drone program I believe stopping is not a solution and the drone program weakens the capabilities of terrorists networks to effectively plan attacks. I subscribe to the "peace means carrying a big stick" philosophy. Change my view on American defense spending and drones.  </original_post>

    <text>Some expenditures may reduce terrorist attacks, but we spend excessively on many different things that don't, and some of these things include obsolete technologies just for political reasons - cronyism, private contract stuff, inefficiencies, overkill, whatever. There was a big debacle over us [spending on tanks generals didn't even want](http://www.military.com/daily-news/2014/12/18/congress-again-buys-abrams-tanks-the-army-doesnt-want.html) and that we'll probably never even use, for one example. 

Defense budget gets flak because of those kind of things, which clearly aren't helping reduce terrorist attacks at all. 

Plus, terrorist attacks on the US are just not easy to pull off even without our militarily funded measures to prevent them. We live across a sea from most of them. If we're being exclusive to Islamic terrorism - we have home grown terrorists and they've actually made more attacks and arguably aren't prevented by defense spending and are more due to cultural problems. We have a variety of white supremacist and/or anti-government groups for example.  

There are some other arguments about how some of our military actions, overreaction to fears of terrorism, and anti-Muslim sentiments aid in recruitment of terrorist organization which benefit from people being upset with America. But we don't even need to go there really. </text>
