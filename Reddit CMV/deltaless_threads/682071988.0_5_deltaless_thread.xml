    <title>CMV: Song remixes are always inferior</title>
    <original_poster>TraumaJeans</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't think I've ever heard a remix that sounded better than the original song. I know that it's technically subjective to me personally, but have a gut feeling that no remix is all-around "better". I strongly suspect that often artists who produce remixes are piggybacking off the original author. I don't think popularity can be a reliable indication of music quality either. Perhaps here "music quality" is from the technical/effort point of view.

I realize that I can write off any remix song as inferior due to my personal taste, but otherwise don't think I hold any strong views and find it strange that I do regarding this. I know it may sound like an impossible task, but really am open to change my mind.

You're saying that no remix ever has surpassed the original.  The best evidence would be examples of just that.  That means posting the original song and then posting the remix, which would be arguably better.

What did you expect?  What will actually change your mind if not tangible examples to your absolute claim?</text>

Ok that does sound ridiculous. I guess I felt that there is something inherently wrong about a remix as a concept. 

&amp;gt;What did you expect?

I really did not have expectations how this thread works out, I think by that disclaimer I was trying to point out that I'm not a lost reddittor who should have posted to music requests for "remix better than original examples". Perhaps was looking for a conceptual perspective I haven't considered before, maybe what goes on behind the scenes / in the industry.
