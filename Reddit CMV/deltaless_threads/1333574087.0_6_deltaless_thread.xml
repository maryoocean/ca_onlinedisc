    <title>CMV: We should allow Trans women in US women’s sports to gain more viewers.</title>
    <original_poster>handologon</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let’s be honest here: no one was talking about US women’s sports before Trans women starting joining the teams. 

Only 4% sports coverage has been devoted to women athletes. But now that Trans women are coming out to play, maybe it’ll be more interesting? I honestly was against the idea of Trans women competing in women’s teams until I realized this. 

Allow a limit of 1-2 Trans women per team so they don’t completely dominate, but it is enough to make people actually want to watch. The increased coverage can make more money for Colleges and official leagues, allowing biological females in leagues to make more money. In order to evenly disperse transgender athletes, there can be full ride sports scholarships given at each university for one to two transgender student. Of course biological females will get full ride scholarships as well, and likely there can be more given out due to more viewers. If our concern is safety, extra safety measures can be put in place. Also we should only start this with non-fighting sports, so no wrestling, cage fighting, or boxing. 

This is the video that inspired my thoughts:

Does this make sense? If not, change my view.</original_post>

    <text>Well...if it's just about getting viewership up, why have any limitations at all?

Make all MMA and cage matches into thunderdome-style deathmatches. Heck, bring in tigers and bears. Remove ALL limitations on steroids and hormone therapy. Let 'em juice UP!

George Carlin had a routine where he talked about some rule changes he wanted: putting randomly placed land mines in the outfield of baseball to liven things up. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

40 years ago basketball was a more sportsman like activity (at least, college and pro games were). Players were not only sports icons, but good role models (for the most part). Now? Thuggery and whining are the norm, because that bad-boy behavior sold tickets (Looking at you, Dennis Rodman). 

My point is be very careful in making viewership and butts-in-seats what it is "all about".</text>
