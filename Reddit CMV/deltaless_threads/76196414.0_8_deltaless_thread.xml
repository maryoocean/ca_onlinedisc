    <original_post>Every now and then, I see the odd post, "If the top 1% gave up their profits, we could cure world hunger" or something ridiculous like that. I dont know why people that have less expect people that have more to help them. Why should they? 

Edit: better example. 

Edit: my C got Ved, /u/amemut explained it in a very pragmatic manner that I could agree with. </original_post>

    <text>All wealth must be produced in the manner determined by the mode of production. There are two productive forces (1) labour and (2) means of production.

In order for the capitalists to profit over their competitors they need to have either more advanced means of production or more exploitative relations to labour. Capitalists cannot get much profit in terms of their means of production for long even with state-granted monopolies like patents and copyright so profit in capitalism inevitably comes from the savage exploitation of labour. 

Since wage labour is so exploitative and capitalists get rich off of the profits of this exploitation they acquire their wealth illegitimately. The capitalists have no obligation to help the proletariat but it is in their interests to make some concessions to them in order to prevent a revolutionary war against exploitation. I won't say anything about theoretical rich people that aren't capitalist exploiters if there are even any such people.</text>
