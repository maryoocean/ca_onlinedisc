    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>ACAB. This disturbs me because it it seems to be used for political purposes more than to actually address police brutality. Is being anti police being anti law enforcement? We must acknowledge and accept that too many police officers are abusive and will eagerly use excessive force (which in some instances may actually be fueled by fear for their own safety-not saying that’s an excuse but may be a reason) but the reality is we have laws developed for citizens to keep us safe, come to our rescue when in danger and get criminals off the streets. How do we do that without police? I myself have called 911 to send officers to help me. Police are not only dealing with crime, handing out tickets and such but they are also dealing with people who are armed and mentally ill and are sometimes violent and unpredictable. I live in George Floyd’s state and because of the fall out of his incredibly brutal death at the hands of a cop, many on site school police officers are being pulled out schools so there is a level of security and safety of students being withdrawn. I honestly do not know how to balance the need for our police and the ability to spot and remove bad cops from duty before they harm someone.</text>
