    <title>CMV: I should be able to sell my organs</title>
    <original_poster>stupidrobots</original_poster>
    <original_post>In short I should receive adequate compensation during life for use of my organs after my death.  The goal of this is to provide a financial incentive to increase the supply (and thus reduce cost) of organs required for transplant.  The benefits I see are as follows:

1) it gives the poor and disadvantaged a way to make money and get on their feet without requiring higher education or years of experience, relieving debts.

2) The financial incentive gives people reason to donate organs who might otherwise not.  This increases supply and drives down cost, and reduces time on waiting lists.  

3) A profitable program of organ collection would allow advertising for agencies that do this service and write up contracts, increasing the visibility of the needs of people who require organ transplants.

4) The argument that this creates a black market for organs is silly.  If someone wanted to kill you and take your organs, laws against it won't really help because now we're talking about maniacs.  

Furthermore my organs are my property, and I get to say what happens to my property during my lifetime and at the time of my death.  To deny this is to deny that individuals have the right to their own bodies.

    <text>[From here:](https://organdonor.gov/about/process/deceased-donation.html#authorize)

&amp;gt; The OPO representative searches to see if the deceased is registered as a donor on their state registry. If so, that will serve as legal consent for donation.

&amp;gt; If the deceased has not registered, and there was no other legal consent for donation, such as a notation on the driver's license, **the OPO will ask the next of kin for authorization**.

Imagine if someone dies and you're their next of kin. You are asked for authorization for donating their organs. If people were paid for organs, then that would mean that the money, or at least a good portion of it, goes to you. This can lead to two problems:

First, maybe they didn't want their organs donated, but you want the money and you're a huge jerk. So you give permission.

Second, maybe they did want their organs donated, but you don't want to look like a huge jerk. If you give permission, then this is indistinguishable from the first case. You don't want people to think that's what's happening, so you refuse.</text>
