    <title>CMV: Fredom of speech is far more important than a few people being offended</title>
    <original_poster>brbrWh0r3</original_poster>
    <original_post>Freedom of speech should be protected and kept, there shouldn't be people arrested for anti trans comments or insulting a soldier/soldiers, or for nazi jokes, or racist remarks or jokes.

Those should all be handled between people, if someone says stuff you dont like you handle it, simply block them or avoid them, theres a whole world you can be in and that persons in a very tiny part of it. 

It makes me nervous seeing people arrested and charged for saying things. It's only leading us to a place where we can be arrested for saying whatever the government doesnt like. And they shouldn't be in that much power to effect our communication with eachother. 

I live in scotland and dont feel I have freedom of speech anymore. 

(For the record I'm a white woman who's bi and have trans thoughts ig for those folks who say it never has been about me, it has sometimes, and in more ways than just those)

Edit: No it's not just anti trans people, Yes I believe crimes other than hate crimes involving speech should be illegal (threatening violence, doxing, defamation) but I also believe insults, jokes and bad takes or thoughts should not be.

Edit 2: Consequences for what is said like losing a job, getting insulted, losing friends ect is totally fine I just dont think the Government should be in charge of what can get you arrested in this sence.

Edit 3: I live in SCOTLAND in the UNITED KINGDOM or in BRITAIN depending what you say, I'm not american, im also not here advocating for my right to be a dick, im just saying the government arent the ones I want saying what I cant say, I mean twitter can destroy lives without them anyway.</original_post>

    <text>The problem with a democracy that tolerates hateful lies is Hitler, Putin, and other leaders have rose to power in democracies. You haven't listed harassment as one thing you don't believe should be tolerated. But the line between harassment and free speech isn't always clear. I'm an American.

The jerks that yell 'faggot' at me are obviously harassing me, but the people who hold up signs that say 'god hates fags' to protest funerals are protected.  If somebody targeted a non public figure individual and publicly called them vermin or cancer to be eradicated because of lies, they could be prosecuted easily; but if they use that same language for a group they're barely rarely held accountable for people acting on what they hear.

Democracy is fragile. Hitler rose to power after the Reichstag (parliament) fire and Putin rose to power after the apartment bombings; these two events were possibly started by the Nazis and Putin's goons.

Ultimately I agree with you that the price we pay for censorship isn't worth it. Hateful speech helps us have an honest look at where we are as a society.

&amp;gt; Like a boil that can never be cured as long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its pus-flowing ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must likewise be exposed, with all of the tension its exposing creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured. - MLK, Letter from a Birmingham Jail</text>

    <text>At least within the United States, Democracy is extraordinarily strong, to the point where the government gets almost nothing done due to constant gridlock. Good luck trying to pass laws to censor people when you canâ€™t even get an infrastructure bill passed.</text>
