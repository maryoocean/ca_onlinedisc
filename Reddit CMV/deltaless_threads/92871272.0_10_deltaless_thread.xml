    <title>I don't think the NSA spying on us is such a big deal. CMV</title>

    <original_post>Here is my reasoning: growing up parallel to the development of the internet my parents always warned me that anything you put into a computer someone out there can see. It is permanent. So I have always assumed there is always someone watching. That assumption at the end of the day hasn't really changed what I put on the internet because everything is strictly my opinion and I don't care what others think of it.

As far as the recording of phone conversations and storing of email, that is just a case of national security. these things need to be saved in case someone is planning a terrorist attack on our nation IMO.	

I am just a normal citizen like many of you, but my opinion differs on this subject matter and I want to understand what the big fuss about it is. It has always just been a common knowledge and understanding for me that I am being watched.</original_post>

    <text>It is wrong because no entity (government or otherwise) should have as much power as the NSA does now. Being accountable to no one and able to suck up such vast quantities of personal data means that they have the power to:

Blackmail a huge amount of people. For example every senator who has an affair or is a pedophile etc. etc. can be blackmailed for their vote.

Monitor memetic currents in society and attempt to snuff out dissent before it properly manifests.

If dissent still manifests, the ability to know exactly what people are key figureheads in any movement and possibly stop them by means such as blackmail or taking them in for an unrelated harmless crime (ie smoking marijuana or pirating).

The ability to know the thoughts and plans of any dissenting movement.

Just imagine if nazi germany had the capabilities of the NSA. Imagine how impossibly hard it would be to mount a resistance to a government that knows everything, that monitors every communication and watches every street corner with cameras.

Any government needs to be afraid of the people to ensure that it remains accountable to the people. The moment a government becomes so powerful that the people are irrelevant is the moment it stops being accountable and you can kiss all those mushy values like freedom bye bye.

To put it simple, information is power and a beast like the NSA with no accountability *will* sooner or later be abused if it isn't already.</text>
