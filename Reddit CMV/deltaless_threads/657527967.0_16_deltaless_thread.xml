    <title>CMV: Modern marriage in the US brings more harm than benefit for men.</title>
    <original_poster>cannibalstreudel</original_poster>
    <original_post>I believe based on marriage laws and divorce practices that marriage no longer has more benefits than harm for men.

For women it's the opposite. I believe this because whether laws state this or not, practices in divorce court often grant kids' custody to the mother from the father when they aren't more dangerous to their kids than their wife. And often men have to give up half their income/assets in divorce when they often make most of the income of the household.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Sure there are emotional benefits to a long term relationship. But there aren't extra benefits for men on top of an emotionally committed relationship that exclusively comes with marriate.

The security marriage itself brings is only for the woman. She gets to enjoy financial guarantee of sharing income when men often make more than women, and she can be assured of his fidelity - it's backed up by government enforcement... women rarely are punished for fucking another guy and being impregnated at the level men are, and often the man in the marriage gets cucked and is made responsible for raising another man's child.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Men are bringing unnecessary vulnerabilities on themselves when they marry a woman in modern US courts.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

If someone can reliably demonstrate that marriage gives more potential benefit to men than potential harm, I would believe marriage brings more benefit than harm to men. And to be clear, I'm not talking about long term relationships, I'm talking about specifically signing a marriage document and putting the law behind the union.</original_post>

    <text>Its not about your benefit nor the woman's... Marriage is about the family cell being the better way to raise children, and its about their benefit.

You get some tax benefits, someone to share chores with, some1 to help when you're sick. But its never about you... </text>

    <text>Well, the government wants to encourage the standard family cell, which includes marriage. 

There are countless of researches stating how well off a kid growing in a family with 2 parents.

In theory, sure, a LTR can substitute a marriage. But once you get a kid, you're hooked in either way.

Thing is, if you are planning a 20 year LTR u might as well get married for the benefits... Its not like once your kids hit 18, you leave and start the bachelor life again at 50... You're old and nobody will care for ya</text>
