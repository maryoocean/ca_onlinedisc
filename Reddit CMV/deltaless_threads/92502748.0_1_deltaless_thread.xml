    <title>I believe using an individual's race to determine anything about them is not only immoral, but is not beneficial in any way. CMV.</title>

    <original_post>**Preface:** my mother and I have been in this argument for a long time and any time a racially charged court case or anything of tbe sort occurs it gets brought up. I want someone to articulate it to me in a way I can understand because at this point I see no validity in her side whatsoever.

I keep hearing this argument that "one day when I'm put in a situation i'll understand" - still waiting for that day. Here are some examples of the kind of profiling I'm talking about:

* Being from the good old south, I hear family, friends and acquaintances say "oh this is a rough part of town" when they pull up to a stoplight and see a few black people hanging around outside.

* Another is just seeing people get uneasy when a black male walks into a gas station, bank, or some other place.

* And the last major one is like NYC's stop-and-frisk policy. They basically had a quota from commanding officers to stop young black males walking down the street, question, and frisk them.

Now, in the first two situations, my counter-argument is simply to ask how does this help? Do you feel like you have avoided dangerous situations by assuming black neighborhoods are dangerous? Have you ever prevented a robbery at a gas station by being on high-alert?

As for the last situation, I think this policy has a *negative* outcome. By being blatantly racist, these individuals who are stopped lose faith in the law. They assume police have ulterior motive to put away black men which can lead to them reacting in a negative way, which puts the police and the individuals in danger, amd perpetuates the idea that black men are violent and dangerous. It also leads to a lack of trust in law enforcement and can result in vigilantism.

**I believe that racial profiling, while it may prevent crimes, creates a bigger problem in perpetuating racial tensions and creating a lack of trust in the legal system.**</original_post>

    <text>I disagree, stereotypes exist for a reason. While they certainly arent true across the board they do hold true for the most part. Also mainstream black culture promotes gangbanging and violence and all those shenanagins you hear in those dang rap songs.</text>

    <text>And who benefits by having a stereotype? More people are harmed by stereotypes than benefit from them. Shouldnt it be a goal to get rid of them?</text>
