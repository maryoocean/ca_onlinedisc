    <text>Note: I've posted this elsewhere and and pasting it here, since it addresses your argument.

Population growth is [decreasing](http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_on_global_population_growth.html) to the point where we are likely to level off in the coming years.  We currently grow enough food to feed everyone on the planet and then some.  The decreasing costs of renewable energy are going to have a very positive environmental impact.  Even heavy polluters like China are [increasing renewable energy production](http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/china-increasing-use-of-renewable-energy-20130429-2indt.html).  As for quality of life, it is getting significantly better all the time. [Global poverty](http://www.economist.com/node/21548963) is on the decline while life expectancy is rising. [Crime rates](http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/06/11/12170947-fbi-violent-crime-rates-in-the-us-drop-approach-historic-lows?lite) are dropping as well, in some areas reaching record lows. 

Basically things are getting better all the time.  </text>
