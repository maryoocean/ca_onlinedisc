    <title>CMV: r/childfree is a toxic sub</title>
    <original_poster>SosRashneer</original_poster>
    <original_post>childfree is toxic. The sub isn't about being childfree, its about hating children as a whole. When I see a post on childfree its always about someone hating on other peoples "Crotch goblins" or "little brats". Like sometimes the child will be doing nothing at all and they're like "ugh I hate the little fucker so much like keep your crotch goblins inside your own house."
And I never really see any thoughtful discussions going on there I always only see someone hating on some other peoples children. And when someone tries to defend the child they usually get banned or downvoted. And I understand the reasoning of a child being expensive as to not having one, but if you're complaining that they're selfish that's the parents job to fix, and annoying, that can also be fixed by the parent.</original_post>

    <text>Can you link examples of posts where people on r/childfree were upset with children for simply being somewhere they could rationally be expected to be?  All the posts that I can recall either complained that the children in question (and/or their parents) were being obnoxious, or that children were present somewhere they shouldn't, or weren't even allowed to be (wine tasting vents, R-rated films in theaters, etc.)</text>
