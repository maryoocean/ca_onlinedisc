    <title>CMV: It's stupid to care about the environment in space.</title>
    <original_poster>MostRecommendation84</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm a big proponent of space colonization/exploitation and every time I bring it up there's someone who says something along the lines of "Oh we're gonna trash the Moon like we did Earth?" "Oh good more mining!" "Humanity won't rest until we've exploited everything we can!" and other snide comments to that effect. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Honestly, it just sounds like the dumbest argument to me and I wouldn't even be bothering with a CMV if I hadn't heard it so many times. *It's rocks. Uninhabitable barren rocks floating through vast chunks of literally* ***nothing****.* There's no space squirrels to worry about, we haven't found any aliens and we really have no reason to assume any are out there, let alone that they give a shit what we do to Mercury. Furthermore, you want to stop desertification or the human rights violations of cobalt mining, you're gonna be hard pressed to find a better solution than the absurd volumes of water and cobalt from here to the asteroid belt.</original_post>

    <text>The thing is, we KNOW that earth can sustain us if we look after it.

Yet we're trashing Earth to produce the rockets etc necessary to try to explore space and figure out if we can make it sustain us.

We could well trash the Earth to the point where it can't sustain us, without having got to the point where space can sustain us. And then we're fucked.

We'd be wiser to just look after Earth and leave space alone</text>

    <text>And what happens when we've looked after Earth enough that us and it last until the potential expansion of the sun is a problem (and no, don't say it'd be as controversial as climate change unless you can name one industry that'd benefit in the same way fossil fuels do off climate change denial), are we just supposed to "go down with the ship" or find a way to metaphorically strap rockets to it and create an artificial sun to last until we find a new one</text>
