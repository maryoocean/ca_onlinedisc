    <title>CMV: I don't like tipping.</title>
    <original_poster>litle5o</original_poster>
    <original_post>Leaving a tip feels so customary in certain places that it's become an incentive to do your job properly. I understand that it's the service that they provide and not just the food, but isn't that exactly what they're paid for? To give a paying customer a good service? Although I sympathize with their outrageously low wages, but why should I have to fork out more of my money that I'm already spending at a restaurant to subsidize young Jenny here, to get her up to normal living wage? Isn't that a governmental issue of poverty/low wages?</original_post>

    <text>Look at it this way:  You're paying that tip one way or another.  "Tipping culture" allows YOU to decide if and how much to tip.  In a culture where you just have higher wages to begin with, that's not coming out of the business's pocket; it's coming out of yours.  You just don't have a say in the matter.  Good service, terrible service, it doesn't matter.  You're paying the business owner more in the form of higher prices, and they're paying SOME of that onto your server.

Tipping means the business owner isn't involved.  You're giving your money straight to the employee, but it's not extra money.  It's just a situation where part of the bill is left up to you.</text>
