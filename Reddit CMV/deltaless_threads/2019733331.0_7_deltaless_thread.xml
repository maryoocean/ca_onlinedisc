    <title>CMV: Customer service sucks</title>
    <original_poster>comeandgetsome30</original_poster>
    <original_post>I know this is a broad generalization, but holy hell, I remember a time when I'd walk up to a counter and not be met with someone who would just stare at me until I initiated interaction. I know life sucks, but geeze, try just a smidge to be kind to those who aren't actively f*cking you. The problem seems to be ubiquitous, whether on the phone or in person. People seem disenfranchised, and with good reason, however this negative attitude just spreads like a contagious bug. 

I know this is subjective. For those who are old enough to compare times, I wonder if there isn't anyone who doesn't share this opinion. For those who aren't, I feel pity if this is your normal.</original_post>
