    <title>CMV:I see no real reason to avoid resurrecting an extinct animal through cloning, and believe that fears of consequences are wildly overblown.</title>
    <original_poster>Runner_one</original_poster>
    <original_post>Jurassic Park, while a wildly entertaining movie, did a disservice to the public by planting irrational fears in the mind of the general public. 

While there is little chance of resurrecting a T-Rex or other dinosaur, we may be only a few years away from seeing a mammoth or saber-tooth walking the Earth again.  

Many people fear this and some are even actively working to prevent this from ever happening.

Some people argue that the introduction of foreign animals into an ecosystem would do much more damage than good. 

Less common but incredibly vocal are the people that see such experiments as an affront to God or Nature. 

Other people say that funds wasted on resurrecting an extinct animal could be better spent on conserving living animals.

I for one would be overjoyed to see news of living woolly mammoth walking the Earth again.  I also believe such an announcement would result in massive funding influx from private sources that could result even more scientific advances. These advances could have benefits for humans far beyond what we can imagine. 

A perfect example of such unforeseen advances are the many benefits brought about by the Space Race.  There are far too many to list here, but [Wikipedia lists perhaps over a hundred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_spinoff_technologies). I fully believe such spinoffs in biology would greatly benefit mankind.

    <text>I don't know if this is a compelling reason, but I think you will agree that it is a real one and one that should be considered even if we decide to recreate these extinct species.

One of the largest objections to this research is on humanitarian grounds. There is a high chance that many of these creatures would not be "viable" and end up living short lives of intense suffering.  Does the potential advancement of science justify that suffering? 

Maybe. But it's a discussion we should have. Perhaps it won't be the deciding reason, but it is a real reason.

I'm not sure you can really comment of the viability of the products of a technology that doesn't even exist yet. It's only a real reason when it's a real problem.</text>

    <text>Its existed for over a decade and these are common problems.
