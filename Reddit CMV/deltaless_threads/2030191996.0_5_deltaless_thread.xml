    <title>CMV: It's fair to compare carnists (people who eat meat) to nazis.</title>
    <original_poster>Arkenhiem651</original_poster>
    <original_post>1) Carnists think that animals are inferior; Nazis think that jews are inferior
2) Carnists put animals in camps; Nazis put jews in camps
3) Both jews and animals attempt to escape
4) Both are/were normalized. Anyone who goes against these beliefs were/are suppressed and treated as illogical/emotionally driven
5) Both are unnecessary 
6) Both are/were driven long distances and murdered
7) emotional detachment from the victims
8) Both are sentient
Alex Hershaft a holocaust survivor also used this comparison along with other vegan holocaust survivors.
"We're focusing on the victims rather than the cancer of oppression itself",[8] and that "I noted with horror the striking similarities between what the Nazis did to my family and my people, and what we do to animals we raise for food: the branding or tattooing of serial numbers to identify victims, the use of cattle cars to transport victims to their death, the crowded housing of victims in wood crates, the arbitrary designation of who lives and who dies — the Christian lives, the Jew dies; the dog lives, the pig dies."[6

Also Alex Hershshaft looks extremely young considering he's 88 and survived concentration camps. That's irrelevant but I thought it interesting enough to mention considering he claims it's due to his vegan diet.

Edit: I know I say Jews but this also applies to other victims of the concentration camps such as Slavic peoples, gays and communists</original_post>

    <text>Point number 8 is interesting. You say, “both are sentient”, and quote a Jewish Holocaust survivor comparing his experiences to animals being slaughtered.

For balance, you should provide a quote from a pig or cow talking about how their time on a farm reminds them of a concentration camp.

I’m guessing you won’t be able to find one. And therein lies the reason that your claim is ridiculous.</text>

    <text>Animals can talk to other animals. We can't understand cow language nor can they understand us.

    <text>Ok. In that case why don’t they warn each other of their sad fate? 

Every time I’ve been to a farm I see cows just munching away on grass and pigs blissfully rolling around in mud. They don’t look too worried.</text>

    <text>Your study only confirms they take turns making sounds at eachother. Doesn't mean they're actually communicating.

    <text>Plus the quote of the Holocaust survivor exists because of the mutual understanding that humans should not be treated like animals. OP is comparing a Holocaust survivor with Nazis.</text>

    <text>So just because they can't talk, it is okay to kill them? You're drawing false equivalence.</text>

    <text>I’m drawing a false equivalence? 

I’m not suggesting it’s ok to kill animals. I am pointing out that the OP’s assertion that Jews are like animals is absurd.</text>
