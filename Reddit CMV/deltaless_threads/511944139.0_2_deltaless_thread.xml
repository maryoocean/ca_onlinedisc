    <title>CMV: People forgo their right to complain if they never do anything about it</title>
    <original_poster>ooselfie</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have a few friends that complain about their life ALL the time. I hear things like:

"My job sucks, I'm miserable here"

"God school sucks, I'm studying something so uninteresting"

I think they have total control - it comes down to laziness, or perhaps they don't even really want anything to happen. It is so easy to put in some extra effort in your day to make things happen for yourself. They complain and complain but never do anything to change. It's like the boy who cried wolf. 

If you constantly complain, but do nothing to mend the problem, then you shouldn't be allowed to complain.

    <text>So I can't complain about the injustice faced by minorities in the middle east without going over there and trying to help fix the problem?</text>

    <text>That's a strong assumption that going over there is the only way to help fix the problem. </text>

    <text>Let’s go with a topical example. Would slaves who’ve seen their brothers and sisters murdered for even thinking of rebelling or escaping not be allowed to complain if they themselves have never attempted to flee or rebel</text>
