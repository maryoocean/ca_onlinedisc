    <title>CMV: If you think abortion is murder, you can only have 1 specific opinion on it.</title>
    <original_poster>Send_Me_Trump_Nudes</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let's start this by saying I don't want to have any arguments about whether abortion is murder or not. I really feel like someone is going to think I am pro-life, I am not. However, my argument is basically saying that IF and only IF you do believe abortion is murder, you can only have the following specific opinion on it:

Abortion is wrong in all cases, INCLUDING rape, except for cases where the mother's health is at risk. 

So basically the main argument is that even rape shouldn't be aborted if abortion really is murder to someone. Here is why. 

If abortion is murder, then it isn't OK. Pretty simple right?
But then you have to get down to the different nuances. Rape is absolutely horrible, but if we assume abortion is murder; murdering because you were raped still doesn't make sense.

Murdering because you might die and you don't want to take a gamble makes sense, as horrible as it is, which is why mothers health is the one exception.

Would like to also include that I am not simply talking about pro-lifers, as there are many variances and AFAIK not all pro-lifers necessarily think abortion is literally murder. 

Thank you, now change my view. :)

Edit: Thank you for the replies, my view has been changed. 

 Just to clarify the murder thing I was only using because I see a lot of pro-lifers use it. I don't really care about the specific wording that should be used, point is that you are killing someone. or someone is dying. Whatever word you would like, imagine I used it.
