There is no such thing as attraction in other mammal species, just the male raping the female and reproducing. 

Attraction in humans is a social construct. It's a way to soothe people or to bond similar to how bonobos do it.

Because us humans have “the instinctive need to produce offspring,” the sheer fact that men want to have PiV sex with women just for fun or without wanting kids, proves it's not a natural attraction.

Plus, most women don't care about being penetrated. It doesn't feel good for us, clitoral stimulation is a need for most. PiV sex has no purpose outside of getting pregnant. Sexual relationships are not necessary at all.</original_post>

Dolphins have been observed to have sex for fun. Does that not make it a natural thing?

There is also a large difference between sex and rape, consent is the difference between the two. Animals in the wild have been noted to consent to sex when they want it.

&amp;gt; Sexual relationships are not necessary at all.

[Not having sex for long periods has been noted to cause mental health difficulties such as insecurity.](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326518#:~:text=When%20sexual%20abstinence%20is%20involuntary,person%20feel%20insecure%20or%20anxious.)</text>
