    <title>CMV - President Trump's "shithole" comment about Haiti is not inaccurate, and because Haiti receives American aid, it should not complain</title>

    <original_post>I'll focus strictly on Haiti for this.

Calling certain countries shitholes isn't incorrect. I'm not arguing Trump should've said it, but I am going to defend his assertion that Haiti is a shithole, and it shouldn't complain while it receives American aid.

Shithole is defined as:

A very dirty or unpleasant place

Haiti is a shithole, as it has widespread cholera, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, typhoid, and leprosy. All of these diseases are spread in unclean conditions, and all of these are unpleasant diseases, qualifying Haiti as a shithole. In addition, if you look at images of Haiti, the gutters are filled with garbage, the sanitation is horrible, or simply doesn't exist, and most of the country lives in squalor.

To compound this, Haiti is also extremely poor, with the average person getting $350 per year, which is ridiculously low, and can in no way be considered pleasant, further qualifying Haiti as unpleasant, and therefore a shithole.

My final point is that Haiti should not complain about calling a shithole (At least not without expecting some repercussions on it's aid), as it is both accurate, and it is receiving foreign aid to "fix" its problems. Each year, the United States spends $1.5 billion in Haiti (I've seen conflicting sources on the exact number, but the point still stands), which is a huge amount of money. In addition, the US provides 500k meals each day to Haitian students, so without the US, Haitians would be starving, so they shouldn't complain while we literally feed their kids.

Tldr: Haiti meets the definition of a shithole, by being both dirty and unpleasant, so Trump's comment was not inaccurate, and Haiti shouldn't complain by biting the hand that (Literally) feeds them.</original_post>

    <text>1. The meaning of a "shithole" is vague and subjective, and I don't think it can be so easily resolved by a dictionary definition. To me, it seems to imply someplace that is exceptionally or irredeemably bad, and emphasizes its badness as the primary and overarching characteristic that overshadows all others. In reality, Haiti has much company when it comes to problems of poverty and disease, and has plenty of positive aspects as well, such as absolutely beautiful beaches, friendly people with an interesting culture and language, and some areas that are actually quite nice. I think "shithole" thus paints an overly broad and potentially inaccurate picture of the area.

2. It seems you're implying that Haiti has no right to complain about any statement directed towards it by the U.S. simply because it receives foreign aid from the latter, which is absurd. The simple fact of obtaining assistance from another country shouldn't automatically make the recipient country so subservient or compliant to its benefactor to the extent that it can't even question or criticize it, and that's an entirely unreasonable and frankly debasing expectation to impose on any sovereign and independent nation. This is especially true considering that the U.S. (as far as I know) made a choice to give this assistance out of its own free will without any conditions attached, and with no expectation itself that Haiti would refrain from criticizing or questioning it. </text>
