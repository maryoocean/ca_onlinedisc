    <title>CMV: “service roads” should not exist</title>
    <original_poster>tylerderped</original_poster>
    <original_post>My city has a few “service roads”. For those unfamiliar, “service roads” are complimentary roads on either side of a Main Street separated by medians, usually with a lower speed limit. 

The theory is that they make it safer/easier to go into businesses along a main street. 

The problem is they are actually *more* dangerous and make driving more difficult as well. 

Picture this, you’re driving on your city’s Main Street, going to Home Depot. Let’s assume it’s coming up on the right for simplicity sake. You either need to move into the service lane (while watching out for traffic going *both* directions in said service lanes) and have to stop at several stop signs along the way. 

Or you wait til you’re at the intersection, assuming there’s even an opening at an intersection, and once again have to cross over a set of lanes where traffic is going both directions. It adds unnecessary complexity, and more so, it adds additional points at an intersection where a crash can occur. It’s even more dangerous to do a left turn. This objectively makes service roads less safe than simply not having them. 

Due to the difficulty of use and the dangerous nature of it, no one really uses the service roads in my city, not on purpose anyway. Usually you end up on one by accident and it makes life hell. Getting out of the service lane to go onto the main road is also *extremely* dangerous. 

It’s a waste of space, they’re too hard to use, and they’re dangerous. There should be bus lanes or bike lanes in their place instead.</original_post>

    <text>&amp;gt;Getting out of the service lane to go onto the main road is also extremely dangerous.

Why would it be more dangerous than getting out of the parking lot of a business onto the main road?

The point of service roads is to have a few efficient interchange points between the main road and service roads and a lot of businesses on the service roads where the safety standards don't have to be as high because the speeds are a lot lower.

Maybe they're badly designed where you live, but I live in the Netherlands and service roads work very well here.</text>

    <text>Where I live, the service roads are literally just 2-lanes going both directions on either side of the main road. 

It’s more dangerous than simply turning into it out of because you have to get into or out of the service lane, which involves the same actions as simply turning into or out of the business in the first place, adding unnecessary complexity and points of potential impact to what would be simply entering or exiting a business.</text>

    <text>Then it sounds like they're simple badly designed. Usually a service road only has a few access points to a main road, and those access points or easy to recognize and people are aware of traffic there.

This is much safer than there being tons of business where people could suddenly emerge from onto the main road where people drive fast.

A service road is to a main road what a main road is to a highway. There are a few points to get from the main road onto the high way and that's much safer than just everything being on the highway.</text>
