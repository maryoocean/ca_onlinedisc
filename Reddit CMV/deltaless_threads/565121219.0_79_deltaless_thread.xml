    <title>CMV: it is a jerk move to play music while camping within earshot of other campers.</title>

    <original_post>We put a tent up in a state park campground for about 4 weeks out of the summer. Most of the time you can just hear nature, people talking, kids playing, lots of birds and squirrels  . Every 5th day or so, there is someone who brings some Bluetooth speakers so they can listen to music , but loud  enough  that people in a half dozen sites nearby get to ‘enjoy’ whatever they are playing. 

Right now I’m cooking dinner and the guys next to me are playing U2, Dave Matthew Band and similar inoffensive crap.

This would be entirely normal in a backyard gathering, but once you reserve to be in a public campground, it becomes selfish, intrusive,  rude.

Am I wrong?

(I know it’s a known risk of car camping. I’m not really  mad. More rolling my eyes. I wish they’d shut that crap off.  )

    <text>To be fair, when I’m in the woods, I don’t want to hear you at all. I don’t want to hear your kids. I don’t want to hear your car. I don’t want to hear you and your friends laugh. I don’t even want to see the light or hear the crackling of your fire.

So I find or rent a rustic campsite where I can’t see anyone else. There are plenty in Michigan.

If you’re at a typical “campground” with a bunch of people, then yeah, you kinda signed up for an experience that includes the noise other people make.

Find rustic campsites in your area. If you’re already at a rustic campsite, find a better one next time.</text>
