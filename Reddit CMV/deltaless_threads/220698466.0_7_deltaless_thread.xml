    <title>CMV: Saying you don't care about freedom of privacy because you have nothing to hide is like saying you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say.</title>
    <original_poster>MoonbirdMonster</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've argued about this with a girlfriend a couple times now. I believe that the freedom of privacy is a kind of pillar of American freedom, along with life, expression, etc. If we do not have privacy we have lost among our most basic of rights. Her argument is that it doesn't matter if we've lost them, because the government (see: any vested interest with control in mind) will just spy in you anyway, even after they've been caught (see: Snowden) because they can always find ways to do it without people knowing. My rebuttal is that the battle isn't over until you say it's over, quite literally in this case, because their only threat is us, the people who do want a right to privacy.

I use the free speech comparison because similar things happen when the rights are infringed upon. If your freedom of speech is taken away, you no longer have the ability to voice opposition. This would result in anybody who is for free speech will be impossible to find. It's somewhat similar to what happens today with social media hugboxes, the opposition gets harder and harder to find, sounds more and more crazy with each day. It's pretty obvious where this leads. I compare this to right to privacy because too much surveillance means somebody is more hesitant to do natural things, like criticize those in power. Especially when your country is like the USA which has a long history with torture, but that's another story. 

The point is, I understand that the idea that we have privacy in this age is laughable, but that very idea is exactly why you can't just roll over for it. It's a constant battle that must be fought; it's somewhat unfortunate that it's that way, but always revel in the fact that those rights even exist in your mind because without them, you'd have no idea what you're missing out on.

Feel free to ignore the rambling and just try to sway me. I am open to thoughts and opinions on this topic, embrace the ability to even have this discussion.

    <text>&amp;gt;Saying you don't care about freedom of privacy because you have nothing to hide is like saying you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say.

Not really. "Nothing to hide" is referring to something illegal to hide, whereas "nothing to say" doesn't imply that that something would be illegal.

It would be more like people in the UK saying they don't care about hate speech laws because they don't use hate speech, themselves.</text>

I think that _is_ what it means. It means that e.g. the press is allowed to criticise the government, i.e. that it isn't illegal to do so.

(Note: I may be wrong here, I'm not that familiar with US law.)</text>

    <text>The idea of comparing it to "not caring about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say" is trying to take away the seriousness of what they are saying. They're implying that "nothing to say" means they have no opinions of their own, and thus the whole comparison is ridiculing the opponent and comparing them to sheeple.

But when people say "nothing to hide," what they mean is that they don't do anything illegal or to be ashamed of, and therefore should not be worried about invasions of privacy. Which doesn't match with "nothing to say," as noted above. "Nothing to say" does not imply illegality or shame above the things that they say.</text>

    <text>Well, in the context of freedom of speech it sort-of does. It's like saying "I don't really need to criticise the government", implying that it might as well be made illegal. The point being that you might very well want someone else to be able to criticise the government.</text>
