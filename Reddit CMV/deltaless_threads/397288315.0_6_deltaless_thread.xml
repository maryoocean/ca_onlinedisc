    <title>CMV: The ESRB rating system is frivolous and inaccurate</title>
    <original_poster>Aid2Fade</original_poster>
    <original_post>My parents prevented me from playing games rated above the ESRB required age. I don't think this was helpful or necessary, and in fact I experienced a short period afterwards where I specifically sought out games like CoD for the novelty of it. I understand that people may find the concept of violence grotesque, but video game violence is incredibly cartoonish. Not many people, or children I'd think, would belabor under the illusion that the silly video game blood on-screen has anything to do with what a realistic analogue would entail. I've even heard from people that it helps get aggression out of their system. Additionally, things like innuendo, violence, and 'bad language' are lumped together without any real way to differentiate. Even if I accept that there's benefit in controlling content, there doesn't seem to be a way for a parent that would want to pick one or two factors to actually choose. But beyond the value to isolated households, even if you tell your kids to not play M games, someone else's parent isn't going to care and will probably just let your kid play one at their house. Plus, if the concern is language and innuendo, they run into those at school anyway. And instagram is hardly sparing either. I just feel like the ESRB wasn't that useful at first and is now even more of a dinosaur.

    <text>You need to understand where the system came from. Some developers did have their own ratings system, but this was difficult to keep track of as different developers used different ratings and they put different severities on things like blood and violence. Games like Night Trap and Mortal Kombat brought it to national attention during a senate hearing where our politicians gave the industry the ultimatum "regulate yourselves of we will."

Before industry wide self regulation like this, companies like Nintendo were quite heavy on censorship of sex, language, and anything that insinuated death (and to some extent, still are).

For the large part, the ESRB ratings are not legally binding, with the exception of the Adults Only rating, which the console manufactures won't allow on their hardware anyways.

The ESRB is here to stay even if it seemingly dissolves and comes back under a different name, but issues with it are present in all non-government ratings boards throughout the world. Games that allow for same-sex relationships are given the equivalent of the mature rating due to what is known as the "Russian Gay Propaganda Law". Japan is more lenient on sexual themes, even of what appears to be of school age boys and girls, than the US.

The ESRB does have its share of issues, but such a thing is bound to come up when the board is made up of industry representatives who are typically much older than us.</text>
