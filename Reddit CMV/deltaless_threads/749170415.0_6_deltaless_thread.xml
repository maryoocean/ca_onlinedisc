    <title>CMV: The USG can’t stop all of us, we could change this country tomorrow with direct action</title>

    <original_post>The institutions they run the US are horrendous.  

We have the worlds largest prison population, which maintains legal slavery.

Capitalist overlords hoard the majority of wealth while the working poor is real and growing.

For not the first time in kinda recent history concentration camps are back. 

My entire life I’ve been told things are the way they are, and there’s nothing to be done about it.  But that’s fucking bullshit. 

I don’t believe for a second that reforms will ever give power, real power to the people of this world. The teachers, the workers, the families that will grind through this hellscape as best they can for their entire lives, just trying not to go hungry on the streets.  

The State has a monopoly on violence. If we break that monopoly up, if we use that power for ourselves, against the enemies of humanity, maybe the world gets better sooner rather than later.</original_post>

    <text>I agree with you that direct action (as opposed to civic action like voting) is the most powerful tool we have for transforming our society. However, I disagree that we should engage in violence. Nonviolent direct action acknowledges the humanity and dignity of every person, both those engaging in the direct action and those we are targeting through our action. When we engage in violence toward others we cut ourselves off from our own hearts and that is not going to make the world a better place. Also, a strategy of violence towards others is weak, because, public opinion. 

What we need is organized, thoughtful, creative, useful, engaging forms of direct action that demonstrate we are on the right side of history and that pull at the heartstrings of folks who are currently disengaged.</text>

    <text>While I do understand we’re you’re coming from, I think we’ve surpassed that. As a country we use violence internationally and domestically towards the betterment of only a few. 

It’s the only language they understand. If you’re adverse to violence that’s okay. Everyone of us needs to do what we can. Whatever that may look like</text>
