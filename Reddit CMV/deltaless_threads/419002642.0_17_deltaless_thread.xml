    <title>CMV: American cities are terribly designed and administered compared with European cities.</title>
    <original_poster>bostoninwinston</original_poster>
    <original_post>Most American cities are terrible compared to European ones. I'm not talking about big cities like NYC or SF- I mean the typical- the average- American city- is just awful by any objective comparison. You can go to out of the way cities in Italy or France, Germany or Belgium, and they build places as though their great-grandchildren would be proud to live there. Here, the average city has no city center, major monuments, or sense of history. In the US. there are few places to gather. The social life of American cities is incomparably lifeless compared to European cities. Our Cities are heavily segregated by race and economic class in the way European cities aren't. The architecture here is mostly corporatist modernism, and looks cookie-cutter. It quickly gets dated in the way the art of European cities don't. People here have to get around by car, and as a result are fatter and live shorter lives than the average European. Our unhealthiness contributes to our under-productivity. The average European city is vastly more productive than the average American one â€“ despite Europeans having dramatically more benefits, time off, vacations in, and shorter work hours on average. We damage our environment far more readily than European cities do. Our cities are designed often in conflict with the rule areas that surround them, whereas many European cities are built integrated into their environment. We spend more money on useless junk thank Europeans do. Our food isn't as good quality. Our water is often poisoned with lead and arsenic, and our storm drainage systems are easily overrun compared to European water management systems.  European cities are managing rising seas and the problems related to smog far better than American cities are. 

I can't think of a single way in which American cities are broadly speaking superior to European ones. Change my view.</original_post>

    <text>Surprised no one has said this yet, but public bathrooms. In Europe in the majority of places, there are no free public bathrooms, you have to pay the equivalent of $0.50 to $1. Even in train stations. It's a wonderful thing to go out for the day without worrying about restrooms.</text>

    <text>Are pay bathrooms cleaner? I'd pay money if I knew I'd get cleaner bathroom. </text>

    <text>I'd say cleanliness of a bathroom is based on how often it's cleaned, how many people use it per day, and the type of people that use it. I would assume that most public bathrooms and paid get the same number of cleanings. For $0.50 I don't think you're scaring away the people who make bathrooms dirty. You could make an argument that with less people using it it'd be cleaner.

In my brief experience with paid bathrooms there wasn't a noticeable difference, but perhaps they are cleaner. No guarantee until you've already paid though.</text>
