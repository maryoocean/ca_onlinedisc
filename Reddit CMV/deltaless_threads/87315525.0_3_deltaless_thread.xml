    <title>I for one would rather have security over privacy CMV</title>
    <original_poster>Gedalya</original_poster>
    <original_post>With all the controversy about the NSA spying on US citizens one quote that has been used very often was &amp;gt;People willing to trade their freedom for temporary security deserve neither and will lose both. -Benjamin Franklin.
Here's my issues with that statement. 
* Freedom is relative, as long as you live in a civilized society you are are never really free. 
*&amp;gt;* Lets say we truly trust the government, what will you propose we should do about the threats we are facing?

    <text>The loss of privacy is not a guarantee for security. How much security is your privacy worth? 1% less attacks on America? 20%? 50? Where do you draw the line? How much does losing your privacy (if any at all) gain the country in security?

People use this same argument about torture. It's okay if it saves lives. My understanding of it is that it has the opposite effect, and taking away privacy will in my opinion also have that effect. 

Also - never trust a governmental organization. Even if you trust them now, 100 years from now you have no idea of the dangers they could create with the power you give them today.</text>
