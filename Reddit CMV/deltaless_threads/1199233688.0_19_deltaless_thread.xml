    <title>CMV: America has far greater freedom of speech than Europe.</title>
    <original_poster>achicomp</original_poster>
    <original_post>My view is that free speech is factually more free in America than the European Union + UK overall. None of the following ever happens in America and never could under the US constitution:

In Austria, a woman was **convicted for blasphemy** when she called the Prophet Muhammad a pedophile. In Austria, Germany and Poland the offence carries a potential prison sentence as well as a fine.

In France, 12 protesters were **fined** for supporting the boycott of Israel.

In Denmark, a politician was **convicted for burning Korans.**

A German politician was **criminally charged** for calling migrants “scum.”

In England, a Baptist minister was **jailed overnight** for preaching against homosexuality and a man was investigated for telling a Nelson Mandela **joke**.

Also in a poll of German citizens. Only 18% of Germans feel free to express their opinions in public. 59% of Germans did not even feel free expressing themselves in private among friends. And just 17% felt free to express themselves on the Internet.

    <text>As a curious european reader: Has the USA absolute ultimate free speech? Can I just make an open statement calling everyone the n-word, the c-word, whatever words there are, claim the holocaust and slavery didn't happen and kindly ask everyone to storm and burn the white house? Are there any consequences?</text>

    <text>There are no government consequences for saying any of the above EXCEPT for asking everyone to storm and burn the white house, as calls for violence is not protected free speech.

The gov cannot throw you in jail for saying the other things you listed. But society can punish you, your employer has the right to choose to fire you for being a racist, for example.</text>
