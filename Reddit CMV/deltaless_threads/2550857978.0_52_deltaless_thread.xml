    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>Here is my question to OP. Let's say cops show up at your house and you put your hands behind your back and tell the cop "Take me". He puts the cuffs on, slams you to the ground. Then puts his knee on your head will all his weight pinning your head to the ground. You of course, are bruised and scuffed (scarred on your forearm and shoulder) and then taken to be processed, and ultimately not charged with anything. Then , you go and pull the police report. Rather than this happening in your home, the cop writes "You approached him in the roadway" among other things that may not exactly match up with the bodycam. You saw the cop was wearing a bodycam. Who do you call? What do you do? Are you prepared to file/deal with a lawsuit vs. the city?</text>
