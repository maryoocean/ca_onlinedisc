    <title>CMV: Actively encouraging everyone to vote is overall harmful to a democratic society.</title>
    <original_poster>The_Law_of_Pizza</original_poster>
    <original_post>I would like to start off by clarifying that I do not support voter suppression, poll taxes, poll tests, or restrictions on voting rights in any form. I even disapprove of removing felons' rights to vote.

That said, I reject those things not because I believe broadening the voter pool benefits society, but because such restrictions are far too dangerous to allow people to meddle with. The temptation by those in power to restrict the rights of voters who disagree with them is too much for people to resist, so as a necessary evil we must prohibit such meddling in any way.

More to the point, though, I believe that actively encouraging *everyone* to vote is the other side of that same coin - it is rounding up reactionary, low information voters to vote for your position on an issue. It warps democracy from being about a collective process to discuss and decide policy, into a competition to see who can bus the most warm bodies to the polls.

Voting is a right, but it is also a responsibility. Voting without being informed is an abuse of that responsibility, and encouraging uninformed voters to go to the polls is aiding in that abuse for your own political benefit.

A democratic society functions best when the voters are rational and informed. They (ideally) learn what they can about any issue, make a subjective decision based on their internal values, and then vote for a candidate or proposal that they believe will best accomplish that. 

While obviously not always true, the people who make a point to go out and vote on their own tend to be the ones who actually care enough to put the time and effort into the process as described in my previous paragraph. They're the closest we get in reality, anyway.

Deliberately rounding up non-voters and pushing them towards the polls dredges up the opposite - low information, reactionary voters whose only knowledge on the issues likely comes from the partisan individuals who gave them the voter registration sheet. They seldom take the time to seek out the other side and hear their version of the story.

So, while these people have every right to vote, they're abusing that right and partisan organizations designed to "get out the vote" are complicit in that. They're harming the overall system for their own gain.

    <text>I know the general expression may be 'get out and vote', but isn't the intent of that really just encouraging people to be more active in the political process?  And isn't part of being informed on who you're voting for in the first place listening to partisan sources making their cases for why you should vote for them?  

Just going out to vote without prompting doesn't mean that you're fully informed on the issues, or somehow more informed than those that don't vote necessarily.  And even if you're encouraging people to vote, and pointing them towards 'your' candidate... the voting is private, even after registering they could change their mind, talk to someone else, or, just by virtue of taking that first step and registering, asking themselves who they should vote for, and start informing themselves to decide.  Unless these people are standing right outside voting places and getting them to register and vote in the same step, I don't see how encouraging someone to vote for one person and register at the same time would guarantee an uninformed vote in your favor. 

People should be allowed to vote based on whatever criteria matters to them, regardless of how informed they might be.  I'm not sure how encouraging everyone to be a part of the process is harmful to democratic society when the goal of democracy is to allow everyone to have a voice. </text>
