    <title>I think non-violent criminals shouldn't be sent to prison. CMV?</title>

    <original_post>I think anything that isn't stuff like murder, rape, arson, robbery (but not burglary) or the attempt or intention to do those things shouldn't be given prison time right off the bat.

I think there should be some sort of three strike system where you could be fined, put on house arrest, or probation before receiving jail time. I think this could be a better system because we wouldn't be mixing relatively okay people with career criminals and it would be less of a strain on our prison system which is already overcrowded due to things like mandatory minimums and the war on drugs.

This is something I just thought about on a whim so I'd like to hear the negatives and why something like this wouldn't work in practice.</original_post>
