    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>Given that some students do not have a choice where they attend school, you can't demand students leave their religion at the door. That's discrimination. A person's religion is often part of their identity. Mandating someone enter a space that asks them to abandon part of their identity (e.g. you can't act like a black person here) is not OK. 

The one exception is if those specific beliefs are causing harm. Racist religions or nudists are examples.

Now on the flip side, the school has no requirement to endorse a specific belief system. You have no requirement to dedicate resources to support a specific religion. 

So while I disagree with banning prayer rooms (no obvious harm done), I don't think schools are required to provide them either.</text>
