    <title>CMV: High school literature and history courses fail to provide meaningful educational value</title>
    <original_poster>dabears_24</original_poster>
    <original_post>In their current form, high school courses focused on history and literature fail to provide meaningful educational benefits. 

These classes commonly have a goal of improving critical thinking skills and develop advanced literacy. However, the format of current history courses where students heavily analyze past events, does not emphasize critical thinking, but rather focuses on memorization of history that has little to no significance in the present. Literature classes that focus on deep analysis of *important* texts like Shakespeare's works, complex poetry, or stylistic writing (i.e. stream-of-consciousness in "Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man") do not develop readinc/writing skills applicable to students' lives or modern texts. They also tend to foster dislike for reading when students are forced to extract meaning from texts they do not value or understand.

I believe a courses in debate, critical analysis of nonfiction works (i.e. argumentative opinion pieces), or even literary analysis of more familiar works would all be better alternatives to detailed US history or general literature courses.

Since this is a broad statement with caveats, I'll clarify in a list:

- I am not arguing the classes offer zero value. The concept of being in an educational environment likely has benefits itself, so my view will not be changed by arguments of the form "all education has value".


- I acknowledge the value of basic history lessons in understand society, culture, and history that affects us today. I am arguing that there is little to no value in all students having to learn of details like specific battles of the Civil War, or the politics of the early 1800s. These topics should be pursed electively.


- I am not arguing that these classes lack value only because they do not tie to future careers. I believe these two courses majorly fail to provide value. I agree that math and science courses do not necessarily tie into future work, but I believe they accomplish their goals more effectively.

I admit I may display a STEM-favoring bias due to my field of study and work, so I am willing to accept arguments that show that my view is a function solely of my bias and not of reason.

EDIT: Want to clarify that I still think history should be taught at a general level in school. I don't think it should be as detailed or exhaustive as a part of the core curriculum. In other words, I think the necessary history can be taught in fewer total classes

EDIT 2: Pretty late in the cycle now, but I'll add this regardless since I've engaged with a lot of arguments that misinterpret my post. I am not arguing against the value of History and Literature. I am saying these classes are ineffective in their current forms</original_post>

    <text>I realize that I’m a little late to the game here, but I did have one argument I wanted to make on the off chance you’re still reading. You say:

&amp;gt;	Literature classes that focus on deep analysis of important texts like Shakespeare’’ works, complex poetry, or stylistic writing (i.e. stream-of-consciousness in ““ortrait of an Artist as a Young Man”” do not develop readinc/writing skills applicable to students’ lives or modern texts. They also tend to foster dislike for reading when students are forced to extract meaning from texts they do not value or understand.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;	I believe a courses in debate, critical analysis of nonfiction works (i.e. argumentative opinion pieces), or even literary analysis of more familiar works would all be better alternatives to detailed US history or general literature courses.

I actually think that literary classics become more valuable as a teaching text over time. When students work with Shakespeare, they’re familiarizing themselves with texts that are still very relevant to pop culture. They’re also working with texts that generations of students have worked with, texts that their parents probably read in school. The classics become a text that they share with so many other people (including employers). The classics are enriched by this backlog of work. Both because it’s an experience current students share with each other and with past students, but also as a means of seeing how our analysis changes over time. The relevant questions about love and gender and what have you that an earlier commenter mentioned are different than the questions that would have been relevant when I was in school or when my parents were.

That’s not to say that students should only deal with the classics. More modern works, and works written by folks who are white dudes are also valuable. But I don’t think we should be writing off the classics yet.</text>
