    <title>I believe that if Washington can have the Redskins, I can have a team called the Black People. CMV</title>
    <original_poster>terb99</original_poster>
    <original_post>I feel that many people would be offended if a city had a sports team that was called the [insert city] Black People, or even The Blacks, with their logo being a black man's head. However, people (for the most part) accept the fact that the Washington Redskins have all of those same elements, except with a Native American.

 I know that in the past, and perhaps even currently, there has been a movement to get these Native American team names changed, but as we know, mostly nothing has come of this. I feel like if I made a team whose mascot was a black man, that team would receive such outrage that it would never survive. But if the Redskins can exist, the Black People should also be able to exist. CMV.</original_post>

    <text>Your argument is similar to saying "Alcohol is a recreational drug and is legal, therefore all recreational drugs should be legalized." </text>

    <text>Well, if the assumption is that one harmful thing is legal, then making other harmful things legal *won't reduce the harm* of that first thing. </text>

    <text>And the counter argument that is also equivalent in this analogy is the observation that *prohibiting* alcohol (and other recreational drugs) is more harmful than the drug itself... as we well learned during Prohibition (and the more recent prohibition, though I hesitate to say any learning has yet been involved in that debacle). </text>

    <text>The prohibition of alcohol led to people attempting to make their own alcohol, which led to poisoning in many cases. 

The prohibition of racism in mainstream media will lead to... what harmful thing? 

The analogy breaks down at this point, because use of illegal drugs are considered "victimless crimes."</text>

    <text>You're correct if we're talking about state-backed prohibition (which the Prohibition on alcohol was), but there are other ways to prevent certain actions. 

For drugs, spreading information on the potential harm that use of recreational drugs can cause may reduce the use of those drugs. 

In the media, viewers' discretion could make using certain words and images no longer profitable, leading to the removal of those things. </text>

    <text>Which, bringing it back around the OP's question... he "can have a team called the Black People", but it's questionable whether enough people would patronize them to make them profitable. The Redskins don't seem to have a problem that way.</text>
