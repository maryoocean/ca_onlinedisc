    <title>CMV: My pregnant wife shouldn’t seek the COVID vaccine</title>
    <original_poster>Herpes_free_5ince_03</original_poster>
    <original_post>So my wife and I have both had COVID in the past and both tested positive for antibodies. I am double vaccinated but my wife has not yet received any. She is approx. halfway through pregnancy and we can’t decide if she should get the vaccine or not, mostly due to unknown impact on the baby and a lack of long-term studies. She works from home permanently so her exposure to others is significantly decreased.

We are not against a vaccine, just feel like we need more info to make an informed decision. She is undecided, I am leaning towards no.

* I firmly believe it is her body and her choice and this post is for info only. She will ultimately make the decision herself

Edit: 

When she contracted COVID before her health was not significantly impacted and she has made a full recovery with no long-term noticeable effects.

Different healthcare professionals have advised different things. Some say to get the vaccine now, some say to wait until the baby is born, one has said to wait until after breastfeeding. The lack of coherent advice is one reason for her (and my) reluctance.

She is permanent work from home with very limited contact with others, when outside we follow all guidelines, wear masks, sanitise and are otherwise very aware of the risk of transmission.

We are not in the US and the vaccine offered is Pfizer.</original_post>

    <text>If she never leaves the house, why get the vaccine? The only reason you would is to eliminate even the very small risk of getting it, which would be the maximum protection strategy. Do you want to make a completely optimal play or a suboptimal one?</text>

    <text>I’m assuming OP leaves the house. If OP goes near someone who is infected and it spreads to him, he will bring it home to his wife. There’s a lot of ways that COVID can make it home without her leaving.</text>

    <text>Why would you assume he leaves the house? He could work from home. He could still be isolated incredibly well with minimal risk.</text>
