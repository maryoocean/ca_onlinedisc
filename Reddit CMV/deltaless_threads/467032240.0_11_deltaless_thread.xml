    <title>CMV: Dating is like finding a job, it isn't good to put all your eggs in one basket.</title>
    <original_poster>nerdywiththeword</original_poster>
    <original_post>To start off, dating is pretty like the job interview in a relationship. you guys are conversing to see if there is a potential fit for each other. If it is successful then there is going to be an offer for a relationship; if not then either the two is going to be friends or merely walk away and say goodbye without staying in contact.

Like job hunting, one should always be vigilant. When it comes to finding a relationship, one should focus on scheduling as many dates as possible to maximize their chances of being in a relationship. It is not wise to only stick to focusing all your attention onto one person because there is a big chance it wouldn't work out. Instead by talking to as many people as possible you are spreading your eggs in multiple basket and improving your chances at beating the numbers game.

This resonates well with job hunters since doing so many interviews (Or in this case talking to many potential people) will give you more opportunities to improve and sell yourself better down the road. I remember doing like 10 interviews before getting my first job. Each interview I improve upon one another and I feel this could be applied to dating.

Another reason not to put all your eggs in one basket is to be better mentally prepared when the date doesn't workout. You have another person to look forward to meeting so you won't feel too down.

    <text>So it sounds to me like your view now is "you should flirt with multiple people to maximize your chances of getting a date", per your reply where you said 
&amp;gt; The new point would be talking to multiple people at the same time to maximize the chances of finding a date. I guess date would be the wrong term to use.

Here's my problem with this: it's now just an opinion thing. It's basically the equivalent of telling someone they should be more extraverted or have more friends. Some people are trying to maximize the amount of dates they get, some people only want to go on dates if they really think they would be a good fit with someone, and flirting with every person they find attractive isn't something they're interested in seems icky. 

If you're into that, that's obviously fine! But it's by no means the "right" or "best" way to go about dating. It's just one option. </text>
