    <title>CMV: It's stupid to care about the environment in space.</title>
    <original_poster>MostRecommendation84</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm a big proponent of space colonization/exploitation and every time I bring it up there's someone who says something along the lines of "Oh we're gonna trash the Moon like we did Earth?" "Oh good more mining!" "Humanity won't rest until we've exploited everything we can!" and other snide comments to that effect. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Honestly, it just sounds like the dumbest argument to me and I wouldn't even be bothering with a CMV if I hadn't heard it so many times. *It's rocks. Uninhabitable barren rocks floating through vast chunks of literally* ***nothing****.* There's no space squirrels to worry about, we haven't found any aliens and we really have no reason to assume any are out there, let alone that they give a shit what we do to Mercury. Furthermore, you want to stop desertification or the human rights violations of cobalt mining, you're gonna be hard pressed to find a better solution than the absurd volumes of water and cobalt from here to the asteroid belt.</original_post>

    <text>Assuming that humanity will one day colonize the entire solar system, resources may run out similar to what we are currently seeing on earth. We might one day value "untouched asteroids" the same way we currently value "untouched nature" on earth. Admitted, this is pretty far fetched, but how would you explain to a medieval person that wastefully cutting down trees may be a bad idea?</text>

    <text>I imagine we'll get better at reclaiming materials as time goes on, right now we're already getting much better at it we just need more time, which space could help give us. Even with extra resources we'll need to figure out how to keep our environment stable either way, but it'd definitely reset the clock on long term resource management.</text>

    <text>Resources aren't "running out" on earth. We have literally barely scratched the surface. The easily retrievable resources that are essentially just lying around are getting in short supply, but we're developing new techniques to extract them better than ever before. 

As for mining space, I agree with the OP, if there are no living things relying on the the environment, there's no reason to protect the environment. Yeah, we have to be careful that we don't just litter the place up and make life harder for future humans via debris or orbiting crap, but otherwise, it's just fine.</text>

    <text>This made me chuckle. Most responses here ignore the ecology of a planetary/lunar surface and focus on the harms of space junk, which is valid. But asteroids are natural space junk that pose the same navigational hazards. Walking through trees is calming and healing, but I don’t think I’d say untouched asteroids have the same majesty about them</text>

    <text>Asteroids are actually very, very easy to avoid. They are very far away from each other (like 600,000 miles apart on average).</text>

    <text>Right, but so is space junk. The problems are equal for both, when they’re traveling at high speed. Micro asteroids wreak havoc on satellites</text>
