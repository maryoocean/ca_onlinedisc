    <title>CMV: 'Jump scares' are a cheap party trick, and movies that are full of them shouldn't be considered horror</title>

Lately I've noticed that most horror movies rely on jump scares. Something will unexpectedly pop out at the audience, a loud noise will startle everyone, you know the works. Sometimes the movie tries to trick people into believing that a certain scene will have a jump scare, to make the viewer feel safe, and then do a jump scare in the next scene.

I think that movies like Paranormal Activity, The Conjuring and The Darkness do not do their best to scare the audience in a creative way.

Jump scares do something physical to your body. Sometimes my mom jumps out at the me when I walk through the door, to elicit a scream or a 'fear' reaction from me. However, a second later I'm just laughing because it's silly and not at all scary.

When I go see a movie at the theater that has a lot of jump scares, most of the audience members just seem to be laughing. You may hear a collective gasp or a scream, but that's just a reflex. 

Most movies riddled with jump scares do not leave an impression on me. I find them annoying.

Jump scares do not tell a story that sends shivers down your spine and causes you to lay awake at night. Jump scares do not show you a gruesome scene that will be burned into your mind for the weeks to come.

Jump scares are cheap party tricks. They are annoying and do not elicit any feelings of terror. 

Change my view.

    <text>I think a Jump Scare is not as cheap as the rash of people that think strobe lights and flashing in EVERY scary movie is actually scary.   I have people in my family that can't watch all the strobe light stuff because it triggers migraines.    So I've gotten to where I notice it and for some reason some group of video producers that seem to be prolific LOVE flashy strobes.   I'd prefer Jump Scares to that any day.   I don't think Jump Scares are always cheap.   They can be used really well too and ADD to the movie.   The problem is when they use jump scares without them adding anything other than jumping. 


EDITED:
 (Example: coming around the corner and having a cat yowl in your face and make you jump = cheap,    Exorcist III panning toward a hall and suddenly seeing a weird figure move across the hall in the distance in a weird way, and causing a jump and a WTF was that moment... as opposed to the CAT... you know what it was and it was a stupid trick.    So there are GOOD ways to do it that work well.</text>
