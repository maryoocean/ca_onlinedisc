    <title>CMV: While the GME squeeze is a powerful display of retail trader’s power, there is no endgame that doesn’t result in them losing massive amount of money.</title>

    <original_post>The GameStop squeeze carried out by r/wsb and others demonstrated the power of retail traders and seems like a fair punishment on market makers and hedge funds that have taken advantage of the stock market for ages, but there is no way that it will end well for them. Sure, a lot of stock brokers have lost millions on shorts because retail traders refuse to sell and are still buying, but they can afford to do so because they have enormous amounts of cash to rest on and because GME is clearly overvalued. GME’s market cap is several times its revenue, and the only reason it is that high is because of the artificial demand created by internet communities. At some point, sellers are going to fold and GME is going to collapse, and everybody that purchased it when it was overvalued is going to lose massive amounts of money, while Wall Street short sellers laugh their way to the bank.</original_post>

    <text>I agree that people at the end of this round of musical chairs is in for a world of hurt, but some big short sellers have already unwound their positions and taken the loss, so you should at least amend your view to acknowledge that some retail traders have indeed made out like bandits, and some Wall Streeters have indeed had their nose bloodied.</text>

    <text>I’ll give you that the GME squeeze must have given Wall Street a healthy shock. But ultimately, I see only two people coming off this on top. The Wall Street traders that short at the right moment, and the big players in WSB that are fully aware of what is happening and will either sell before GME collapses or whose sales will cause a collapse.</text>

    <text>There's more than just two types of people who can come out on top. People trading on the volatility for example. If you agree such a person who has no interest in WSB or being a hedge fund qualifies then your view is changed, right?</text>
