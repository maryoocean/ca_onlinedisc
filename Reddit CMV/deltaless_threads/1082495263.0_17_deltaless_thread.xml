    <title>CMV: Donald Trump has taken concrete steps toward establishing a fascist regime, and "losing an election" won't be enough to successfully remove him.</title>
    <original_poster>MaichenM</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm not here to argue whether Trump will win the election, I'm here to argue that it may not matter whether he does.

Right now, what is happening in Portland is what I've come to understand through observation as Trump "flexing" against the barriers that constrain him. No one has been permanently harmed by federal agents purely because that would be too big of a step, too early. He is normalizing the relatively minor violence of terrorizing protesters without actually charging them, and priming the GOP base that supports him to readily accept more severe violence against those that do not support him.

This kind of flexing has gotten Trump really far. He throws something out that sounds insane at first and lets people digest it. Then he does a relatively minor version of it. Once that is normalized, he ups the ante.

The one that worries me the most is his continuous teasing over whether he will accept the election results, and casting doubt on the validity of the election in general. This is coupled with the fact that he still has four months to look at polls, reflect that he is losing, and decide that he must maintain his power undemocratically if necessary. Even if he doesn't come up with a plan to do so, now, there will still be a two-month gap until Biden's reelection that is usually expected to serve as a nice buffer for an orderly transition of power. I know I've mentioned plans, but Trump doesn't need a plan, here. All he has to do is say: "No." At this point, all the resources of the federal government will still be under his control, and his supporters will have already been primed to accept violence toward protesters.

For the purpose of this view, I don't need Trump to successfully install fascism in the US. If he is removed through force, I will still consider myself "right" in the sense that a peaceful election was not enough. My view will be changed if I'm led to believe that Trump will lose the presidency without necessitating violence, or inciting it for his benefit.

EDIT: I have already awarded Deltas to some people who argued in good faith. Starting now, I can't promise that I will respond to everyone, but I definitely will no longer engage with anyone who argues with me on bad faith, or uses personal insults. Thanks to everyone who has presented good arguments.</original_post>

    <text>During times of crisis is when a truly authoritarian figure moves to consolidate power. For example, Hitler came to power when the German government centralized all of their authority in Hitler while in the midst of a financial crisis.

Trump has been given that opportunity with Covid. However, instead of using this crisis to consolidate power he’s done the opposite. He’s relied on state governors and local officials to manage the crisis. Much of the criticism he’s received during this crisis is due to his reliance on local officials. For example, no federal mask mandate.

His response to crisis has proven to be the most federalist (Pro-state, anti-federal government) response of any President in modern history. 9/11 gave us Homeland Security and the Patriot Act. The Great Recession gave us the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Dodd-Frank. Covid has not resulted in new federal powers or bureaucracy.

Your reference to his use of federal law enforcement was in response to roughly a month of rioting including attacks on federal buildings. You can argue that the federal presence has reinvigorated the rioters, but how long should he have waited before intervening?

In the end, your concern of Trump’s autocratic/dictatorial tendencies are overblown. His rhetoric of whether or not he’ll accept the results of the election is more likely pre-gaming the legal battle that will ensue if the race is close, which many think it will be. If this happens, I’m sure the media will frame him as a dictator trying to hold on to power, but Al Gore and George Bush were not dictators. They just wanted to win. Trump will fight if it’s close, hence his reticence to “accept the results”.</text>

Thank you for saying this. OP is a prime example of someone who lives in a weird distorted bubble. And seems to be making broad assumptions based on crazy rhetoric. Its almost scary that the Tea Party was demonized because of ridiculously dumb arguments like birther! And then you see people like OP who also fall into the same trap with their arguments and appear no different than the Tea Party idiots.</text>
