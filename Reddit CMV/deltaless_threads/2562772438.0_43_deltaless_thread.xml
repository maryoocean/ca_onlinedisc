    <title>CMV: It is illogical to not believe in Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>LAMARR__44</original_poster>
    <original_post>Many people either believe in Hard Determinism or Compatibilism. I will argue that both are illogical.

Both argue that human actions are extensions of factors we do not have a choice over. Compatibilism seems to say we are still free but just redefines free will to the internal factors behind a decision, but the decision is still decided by a chain of events outside of our control.

My argument is a sort of wager argument. Either libertarian free will exists or it doesn’t. If it exists and we believe in it, we have made a free decision where we are right. If libertarian free will doesn’t exist, the decision to believe in libertarian free will was out of our control.

So either we have a choice and we can make the right choice, or we don’t have a choice and were determined to be wrong.

Thus it makes more sense to believe in libertarian free will since it’s potentially the only one where we have a chance to make a right choice, if determinism is true there is no choice, so there’s no value in being right.</original_post>

    <text>You haven't exhausted all possibilities.

It could be that: 

- freewill does not exist, and

- I correctly believe that (I was determined to be correct)

Or: 

- Freewill does exist, and 

- I falsely believe that it doesn't (I chose to be wrong) 

There are these additional possibilities. You close by saying there's no value in being right if determinism is true, as if to imply that there is somehow value to believing in freewill if it isn't. This doesn't follow; all value judgement is inherently subjective. What is valuable about believing in freewill in a universe it exists in? Why isn't there the same value in correctly believing in determinism. It isn't clear and you haven't supported the belief, one way or the other, that one has any value, regardless of the truth of the matter.

This isn't even a pragmatic way of looking at things either, so it hardly holds weight as a wager arguement.. usually wager arguments rely on pragmatism such that there is some large difference in outcome one way of the other; Pascal's Wager balances the fate of a person's eternal soul, which is a highly pragmatic matter. However, they are generally weak because they simply highlight the difference of outcomes to entice a person one way or the other in light of some general lack of evidence. The problem in this circumstance is that, it's not only unsupported, but the outcome is inconsequential. Either we have freewill or we in a universe where it really convincingly seems to be the case; regardless, it doesn't seem that we can do anything useful with this information. It lacks predictive power, is not well-supported, and is seemingly inconsequential. Wagers are also generally flawed in that they reduce a set down to a binary choice and we saw that here. Instead of the two you gave, there were at least four.</text>
