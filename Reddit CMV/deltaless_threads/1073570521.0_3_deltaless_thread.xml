    <title>CMV: Free speech and the right to express controversial opinions must be protected (and should be respected) in a free and open society.</title>
    <original_poster>Dankletron</original_poster>
    <original_post>I know this is a touchy subject right now, but it's one I've been struggling with recently as a result. Let me start by fully acknowledging that freedom of speech does not equate freedom from consequences. 99% of the time, I fully stand behind that philosophy. That said, I believe that "cancel culture", doxxing, and the current intolerance amongst some on the left of any free speech deemed to be hateful, ignorant, or highly controversial is, at it's core, unproductive and antithetical to the very democratic ideals that allowed many of those movements arise and build consensus in the first place.

What is deemed an appropriate or "acceptable" opinion has always been defined by the culture and zeitgeist of the times, but opposition to such opinions should revolve around public debate and political and economic disengagement (i.e. boycotts, voting, removal of media platforms, etc). What it should not entail is a rage-fueled vendetta against someone with the explicit or implicit intent of inflicting suffering and lasting, personal harm (like, for example, having the private details of them and their family blasted across the internet).

This creates a culture where only some people get to decide what is an acceptable opinion and I worry that this a slippery slope. I'll be the first to admit that America is *far* from perfect, but what has often separated us from other countries is our shared belief in protected free speech and the right to express it. And there will always be consequences to such speech, but those consequences should  involve resistance to the content of the speech and the platforms that support it, not some spite-fueled attempt to ruin another person's life (deplorable as that person may be). This only fuels a devolving tit for tat that endangers (what I feel) are the very tenets of a free and open society.

I would love hear your thoughts. For the record, I'm a progressive and am very left-leaning myself. I believe we need systemic change in America and that speaking truth to power is how we get there. I just worry that the rhetoric and backlash on the left right now towards those who disagree is endangering some of the very values that progressive, liberal democracy stands for.

If my right to free speech is protected and celebrated, then so should yours.

    <text>I think at some point we'll have to contend with the fact that particular views and ideas are simply incompatible with the larger principles of a "free and open society". Eventually, you will have to choose between Jewish people and the anti-Semites - or minorities and white supremacists - it's unavoidable. Asking them to "share the space" is unfair and inequitable. I worry that such positions as yours are always siding with the aggressor for some reason.</text>

    <text>Maybe a better example to look at would be Israel and the Palestinians?  I'm by no means educated on the situation, but it seems like that's a similar case but instead of a side being passive you have two aggressors.  It's still a situation where you have opinions that are incompatible with 'free and open society' (as far as I know).  So why arent we canceling those ideas?  Certainly seems like we CAN avoid it and do all the time.</text>

    <text>That situation is very complicated, however, and discussion is ongoing as we speak. Claiming either side of that conflict is incompatible with a free society the same way talks of ethno-states - well unless we're talking about *only* ethnostate solutions to the conflict - is a bit wrongheaded in my opinion.</text>
