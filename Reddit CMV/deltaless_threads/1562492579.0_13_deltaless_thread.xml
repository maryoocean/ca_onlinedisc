    <title>CMV: Body autonomy is not a human right where it conflicts with other human rights</title>
    <original_poster>redhighways</original_poster>
    <original_post>  These days the go-to argument by many antivax activists one based on the idea of *body autonomy* as a core human right.

There is an old adage that your right to swing your arm ends where my nose begins. This is a way of saying that rights have limitations: specifically where they infringe upon the rights of others. 

And that, alone, should be enough to quiet vaccination discord. Because being unvaccinated in a pandemic that has brought the world to a shuddering halt is, essentially, swinging your arm around in a crowded room like a five year old child, and acting surprised when there are nosebleeds and disconcerted people around you. 

But I’m more curious about the implication of body autonomy, as a quintessential human right, and how that bleeds over into the philosophy of suicide. 

We’ve all heard the statistic, that every single Golden Gate Bridge jumper who survived says they ‘instantly regretted’ jumping. They say at that moment, they realised every other problem in their life could be fixed, except jumping. 

But the antivax crowd is leaning on the idea of a human right that, by extension, would mean that we should not, and in fact, cannot, help people who want to commit suicide, at any age, for any reason. 

I find that absurd. Especially considering all of the research showing just how impulsive the act of suicide is generally considered by psychologists to be. Something like 90% of suicide survivors do not die from suicide later. Further evidence that it is not a decision they’d make twice. 

While it can’t be denied there are considerable pressures, political and otherwise, pushing an antivax narrative, which is inevitably going to be picked up by some proportion of the population, I think it’s worth addressing what seems at first glance to be the bedrock assumptions behind their logic. 

If we all have the right to suicide, at any time, and this right supercedes all other rights, then the pilot of MH370 was morally superior to someone who gets vaccinated due to a mandate, because his right to suicide was greater than the rights of all of his passengers to life. 

To CMV, I guess I'd need someone to explain a moral system where a Typhoid Mary was the good guy.</original_post>

So just to be clear, I believe you're limiting the argument to discuss suicide, and I don't believe you want to spend much time discussing vaccinations except in points of analogy. I also want to provide some background so you understand where I am coming from:

I'm pro vaccination. I think mandating vaccinations on a government level is excessive, but I support businesses mandating proof of vaccination or disease prevention regulations, as well as state governments mandating disease prevention regulations. 

I'm also an atheist with a nihilistic outlook. To clarify, I mean that I don't believe god exists, and I also don't believe there is any objective purpose for living and that we try too hard to make order from chaos. We only understand things from what we perceive, but we can't perceive a long domino effect that allowed us to live so we try to find reasons why we're alive and what the meaning to life is. I think this is a pointless thought experiment since everything that has ever happened ever is ultimately the result of an accident. 

So to tie it in with suicide: Since I believe there is no objective reason we're alive, we don't need a good objective reason to die. If someone no longer sees more value in life than in death, then they should be free to make the decision that lines up with what they now value. You could argue that their values could change eventually, and that has been shown to be true for various cases. I see this correlation, but I don't believe that this argument is solid in its logic. 

Why does the possibility of a change in values affect which outcomes someone should be allowed to consider? I went to school to be a cybersecurity professional so that I can work in cybersecurity. But say it takes me 10 years to realize that I don't want to work in cybersecurity. Should I not have worked in cybersecurity for 10 years considering that my value changed?

So to wrap it back around, if I want to kill myself and see no more value in living, and I don't see a future of me just 'getting through it' and finally finding my reason to live, why shouldn't I align my actions to my values, mildly speaking? It's not like I can be punished for it, and ultimately it wouldn't matter whether it hurts anyone or not because I wouldn't exist to care.

&amp;gt;If we all have the right to suicide, at any time, and this right supercedes all other rights, then the pilot of MH370 was morally superior to someone who gets vaccinated due to a mandate, because his right to suicide was greater than the rights of all of his passengers to life

Well it's still a crime to murder other people, and I don't think people deserve to be victims of anything like that. I also don't think people have a right to suicide, but they have a right to make their own decisions about their own futures according to our rights (in the US) to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. 

&amp;gt;I guess I'd need someone to explain a moral system where a Typhoid Mary was the good guy

It's gonna be really hard to do that, so I'll just extend this conversation until we can create enough of a more broad discussion to see what exactly the true basis for your argument is before I can address this part. Ultimately, I don't think your argument is truly as extreme you originally presented.</text>
