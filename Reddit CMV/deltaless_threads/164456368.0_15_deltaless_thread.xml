    <title>CMV: Jesus is not that unique of a figure</title>
    <original_poster>CantPenTheSnowden</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've always wondered why people are so obsessed with this Jesus character.

His messages are not unique, in fact they are rather common knowledge, except for the few clever sayings that are attributed to him. Feed the poor, don't let your heart be consumed with wealth and material goods, believe in a higher power, do unto others what you want others to do to you etc. are all common sayings that were preached by hundreds of sages before and after the life and death of Jesus. 

I think of Jesus as being another charismatic figure whose death or martyrdom was made into a legend by his followers in order to legitimize Christendom. I mean what other fashion can you justify genocide, bigotry and forced conversion other than proclaiming that your message is about peace and love? This sort of doublethink astounds me.

    <text>I would like to point out that, if the historical Jesus (Joshua of Nazareth) did indeed exist, there were actually many similar figures at the time that were mostly forgotten about. Theudas, for example, lead a notable cult at the time, as did Athronges. The actions of Jesus Christ, in a historical context and dismissing the supernatural elements, weren't really that unique aside from the fact that they were the ones that "caught on."

You can see kind of a parallel in American history, with all of the new religious movements that sprouted during the "Second Great Awakening". Nowadays, really the only remaining sects of this time period are the Mormons and maybe the Christian Scientists, but there were many forgotten and minor movements like the Church of the United Brethren in Christ.</text>
