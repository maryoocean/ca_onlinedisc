    <title>CMV: The notion that the Democrats or Republicans "must" run Biden or Trump "because there are no other viable candidates" is ridiculous. There are thousands of people who would make better presidential candidates for 2024 than Biden or Trump.</title>

    <original_post>Every argument for Biden or Trump to run in 2024 boils down to some version of "status quo" or "inertia." We're told that the Ds and Rs have no choice but to run these super-old candidates because there's nobody else who could be suitable.

&amp;#x200B;

In a nation of 332,000,000 people, there are well over 100 million who are over the age of 35, American-born, and have resided in the United States for 14 years or more - in other words, are constitutionally eligible to run for president.

Out of those 100 million, surely at least half have a basic education, are mature, sensible, decent people, and have demonstrated solid character - and also be significantly younger than Trump or Biden.

Out of those 50 million, surely at least ten million would qualify as *highly* educated - the metrics of which can be tricky to figure out (is it a master's degree? or something else?) - but they would be significantly above average.

Out of those 10 million, surely at least one million would be quite exceptional - people who have substantially high IQ, have advanced quite far in life and a career - such as being a doctor, or having worked in public governmental service for decades, etc.

And out of those million, surely at least 10,000 would have the political know-how, the charisma, the political interest, maybe have spent significant time abroad in foreign countries or speak multiple languages, to be a suitable president.

In fact, even in Congress, state legislatures or governorships alone, there must be dozens of good, qualified, educated, experienced politicians who would be much younger than Trump or Biden, and who would make suitable presidential candidates. 

So, CMV on this one. I don't buy for one moment the notion that, in a nation of 332 million people, America somehow has no choice but to run Biden vs. Trump in 2024 because "we've got no one else who'd be a good candidate."  </original_post>

    <text>You're partially right. There are definitely people who would be a better choice than either Trump or Biden. The problem is anyone who isn't going to tow the party line won't even be given a chance at running. I mean I'm no Bernie fan but using him as an example, just look what was done to keep him from the nomination. For what, just minor breaks from status quo. 3rd party won't be an option until there are enough people who would break ranks with the big two.  The chances of getting a competent candidate who would actually work to better the country are pretty much nil without a populace willing to get past the false dem/repub dichotomy. The whole outrage from left to right and right to left is manufactured and keeps most people firmly in their chosen camp for fear the "communists" or "fascists" on the other side might win. Both sides willingly manipulated. Sadly because people refuse to take the time to really explore issues and have real debate rather than parroting talking points we are getting exactly what the majority deserves. Keeping a republic healthy requires that the governed be paying attention. Ours is sick and we are the reason why.</text>
