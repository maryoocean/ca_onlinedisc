    <title>CMV: It is illogical to not believe in Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>LAMARR__44</original_poster>
    <original_post>Many people either believe in Hard Determinism or Compatibilism. I will argue that both are illogical.

Both argue that human actions are extensions of factors we do not have a choice over. Compatibilism seems to say we are still free but just redefines free will to the internal factors behind a decision, but the decision is still decided by a chain of events outside of our control.

My argument is a sort of wager argument. Either libertarian free will exists or it doesn’t. If it exists and we believe in it, we have made a free decision where we are right. If libertarian free will doesn’t exist, the decision to believe in libertarian free will was out of our control.

So either we have a choice and we can make the right choice, or we don’t have a choice and were determined to be wrong.

Thus it makes more sense to believe in libertarian free will since it’s potentially the only one where we have a chance to make a right choice, if determinism is true there is no choice, so there’s no value in being right.</original_post>

    <text>Free will is very much akin to random chance for hard determinism.  
Every coin flip has an outcome. If we flip a coin a hundred times and video tape it, then we have the perfect chance to demonstrate this. 

Play the tape back in real time for a new viewer. The viewer does not know the outcomes, and must treat each flip as random chance with an unknown outcome. But they aren’t really random, they have a predetermined outcome that can’t be altered. It just isn’t known.

That’s hard determinism. We are the coin being flipped. The outcome will be the outcome. But we are also the observer of the video and because we don’t know those outcomes we must treat them like they aren’t predetermined.

A brain is just a rube-Goldberg machine of chemical reactions that flips a coin at the end. 

The value of being right about determinism in determinism it is just as meaningful as the coin flip being a nickel or a quarter. The outcome is still heads and we still don’t know it until it happens. 
That unknown means that we will forever act as if we have free will regardless of if it exists. 

The fact that no decision actually has intrinsic value doesn’t make something illogical. Just worth less. You could still place bets on the coin flip video as you watch it. The video won’t change because of it and it will continue to function as if random ether way.</text>
