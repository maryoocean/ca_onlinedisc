    <title>CMV: American cities are terribly designed and administered compared with European cities.</title>
    <original_poster>bostoninwinston</original_poster>
    <original_post>Most American cities are terrible compared to European ones. I'm not talking about big cities like NYC or SF- I mean the typical- the average- American city- is just awful by any objective comparison. You can go to out of the way cities in Italy or France, Germany or Belgium, and they build places as though their great-grandchildren would be proud to live there. Here, the average city has no city center, major monuments, or sense of history. In the US. there are few places to gather. The social life of American cities is incomparably lifeless compared to European cities. Our Cities are heavily segregated by race and economic class in the way European cities aren't. The architecture here is mostly corporatist modernism, and looks cookie-cutter. It quickly gets dated in the way the art of European cities don't. People here have to get around by car, and as a result are fatter and live shorter lives than the average European. Our unhealthiness contributes to our under-productivity. The average European city is vastly more productive than the average American one â€“ despite Europeans having dramatically more benefits, time off, vacations in, and shorter work hours on average. We damage our environment far more readily than European cities do. Our cities are designed often in conflict with the rule areas that surround them, whereas many European cities are built integrated into their environment. We spend more money on useless junk thank Europeans do. Our food isn't as good quality. Our water is often poisoned with lead and arsenic, and our storm drainage systems are easily overrun compared to European water management systems.  European cities are managing rising seas and the problems related to smog far better than American cities are. 

I can't think of a single way in which American cities are broadly speaking superior to European ones. Change my view.</original_post>

    <text>Space...most US cities have more space to expand, change and improve. Any city in western Europe is more crowded and has less room to change and expand than a comparable US city.</text>

    <text>The paradox is that many cities in the US are reaching a space limit where they can't grow much because the suburbs are starting to be more than an hour from the center and the density is so low that housing is a problem too. Cities like Dallas or Atlanta would be far more efficient having 3-4 floor buildings in many neighborhoods instead of single family homes. That would reduce traffic and housing prices dramatically but it needs a change on mentality</text>

    <text>I agree with all that. Space and having the potential to be safer due to being more newly built are the only possible positive differentiators when it comes to US over EU cities. We bought into the siren song of having it all. We forgot that "all" could become all over the place and we'd spend half our lives getting to "all".</text>
