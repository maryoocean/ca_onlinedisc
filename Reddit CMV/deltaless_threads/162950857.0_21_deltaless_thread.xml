    <title>CMV: A direct online democracy where people vote on issues instead of candidates would be better than always having to vote for the less bad of 2 candidates.</title>
    <original_poster>spappletrap</original_poster>
    <original_post>A direct online representative democracy would work better than a republic now that the internet exists.

Before, geography limited people so that they couldn't all participate in an election.  Now we have the internet.  True democracy hasn't been around since Athens--the last time all the people in a society was feasibly able to get together in a forum to vote.  But now it's possible.

I think it would work just fine, and it would even mesh well with our current system.

It's very frustrating how our current parties align. It's like they're perfectly aligned to create maximum fighting between themselves, but in the end up being exactly the same on all the most important issues, like war, monetary policy, labor rights, and energy investment--where the policy of both is pretty much "Fuck you."

Voting on issues would make it so someone who is very religious could vote pro-life, but also pro-environmentalist.

Someone could vote for gay marriage, but also against gun control.  Right now, these things are essentially impossible in national elections.

Or go to /r/openparty/ and start working it out if you agree:



Edit.  One thing that has been brought up, that affects the discussion pretty deeply is the distinction between: 

a)a system where every single vote has to be done through every single person.  

b) a system where people can then vote on policies related to the system itself, and so could evolve.

I was imagining (b) when I posted this, but there's a lot of discussion around (a) as well.

Edit2.  Just to pre-empt a few of the common counter-arguments:

-Most people are stupid

OK, that's a common opinion, not one that I personally hold.  But even if people are stupid, we now have a science committee full of people who don't believe in evolution or climate change.  I would trust randomly selected people from the country over that.  It's been shown time and time again that crowdsourcing performs just fine.  

-Voter Turnout

People wouldn't be forced to vote on topics that don't apply to them or they don't understand.  In fact, they could just as well be encouraged not to.  I see it as a negative that I vote for Obama because I want public healthcare, but then I also have to go with his opinion on farm subsidies, when I don't know what that is, and I don't have time to research it.  In this system, I wouldn't have to.  

-Hackers

I think if the vast majority of the internet can run on open-source software, we can figure something out on this front.  There are security issues with our current methods, too, but we figured it out.


Edit 3:

OK people, we can throw it in.  Cmall2 C-ed my V.  It was pretty good.
The basic points were:

-The dynamics of when a minority would get totally screwed would be very hard to predict.

-The whole system would potentially be very volatile.  Some things which should probably change slowly could change very quickly.

While I still think a variation on such a system could be more effective, the statement I made is that this particular kind of system would be better than the one we have now, and now I don't know if that's true.  So it's no longer my view!

Thanks for the good times guys!

Edit 4:  One last edit for posterity:  It's kind of funny all these people who are deathly afraid of people voting in their own interest, yet believe firmly in the invisible hand.

    <text>Your idea is nice but it fails to address the complexity of legislation.   As it is congressmen whose full time job is legislation aren't reading the bills they vote on.   What makes you think you have time to carefully read through and research 5000 pages in a Bill when full time legislators don't always? 

Does the average person understand enough about the system to write the proposed legislation so the wording will be legal?   Or will it be ruled illegal the first time a court gets a challenge? 
Do people always think long term and put the countries interests before their own?   Or will we have a nation of people giving themselves every thing -- until the country is bankrupt? </text>

    <text>I don't, but if the bills are only being read by assistants, then why are they being enacted?  If our legislators don't have time to read the whole bill, then why should they be deciding on these things then have tangible effects on our lives?  A few seconds of thought and then there's a policy that has the power of law behind it?  It would be one thing if it were guidelines, but it's not.  People can go to jail for things that representatives put very little thought into.

I don't think any 1 individual does, but with the combined attention of 316 million people, I do think a more optimal solution would come about.

Also, national economies don't work the same way that households do.  Money is something that people made up, and when it is devalued, people feel the effects.  If people gave themselves a bunch of stuff and then inflation started occurring, they would then tend to vote to tighten the purse strings.

As it is now, most people are so cash-poor that almost all investments are bad because nobody can afford anything.  Banks don't lend because nothing will sell because nobody has money to buy it, because only a few people have money, and they have everything they need.  They can borrow money essentially for free, but they won't do it because there is nothing worth investing in.  If people had the power to spend a little money on themselves, it would be very good for the economy.
