    <text>What exactly would less people contribute to peak oil and climate change? It would only slow them down, we still need to find ways to work around that. 
(You state "any means necessary", so I assume you are not only talking about birth control policies, but also violent solutions of all kinds)
High food prices and eventual natural disasters might mean that many people will die -&amp;gt; but is killing many people really a good way of avoiding people dying? And how do you decide how many people should be killed/not saved/not born? We can't predict the future good enough to even get the magnitude of that number "right".</text>
