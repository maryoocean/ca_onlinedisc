    <title>CMV: Kink and BDSM should not be at public pride events and should be kept for 18+ ones</title>

    <original_post>To start, I am a lesbian. And I've been seeing recent controversy about this topic. 

Look, no denying that kink plays a big role in the creation of pride. It is a part of embracing sexuality and shouldn't be excluded from the community. 

However, it should not be at public pride parades. Pride should be for everyone of all ages. Many people say "stop catering to the straight capitalized ideal of what pride should be" and "pride isn't a party, it's a protest don't police us" and "children should go to disney if they want family friendly" This has nothing to do with straight rainbow capitalism. I figured out I was LGBT at age 11 and trust me if I saw a kink act in public I would be kind of disgusted. I'm still a minor now, and I'd be less disgusted but still. I know people say that it's up to you to bring your children to pride, but by making all pride events "wear whatever you want even if it's nothing" we are also kinda excluding minors from it. It's also non consensual to anyone who is exposed to such acts, because nobody wants to go to pride to see naked people right? The "think of the children" phrase holds true here. Young children and teens embracing their sexuality shouldn't be forced to see adult acts against their will. 

Again, no denying the role kink plays in the community, but it should be kept at 18+ events. There should definitely be a separate pride for people who just want to do leather and other kinks. That way, you can do whatever you want in a safe space where you know you won't offend others, and because people consented to come to an 18+ event, it's all good. 

That's just my personal opinion on it, but it seems to be the minority. I'd like to see how you guys think about this.

Edit: it appears after reading and responding to several comments, I don't really have a problem with kink, but more with public indecency. I don't care if you wear a collar or leather pants. But I'd rather not see things that could get you arrested or questioned for doing in public.</original_post>

    <text>I've never seen kink or BDSM at pride. I've seen people dressed up in gear, but that's to be expected. I'm honestly not sure what you've seen that offends you. 

And what kind of nudity is at prides you've seen? I've seen breasts, butts, not many penises, but I live in Germany so no one cares at all. It's literally just the human body, who cares? 

If someone is being spanked in public, that's BDSM in public without the public's consent, a no-no. If someone is a leather-daddy with a whip, that's just a dude in leather with a whip. 

Also I think that pride might be becoming more inclusive of alternative lifestyles, like BDSM or kink. Being who you are is important and should be embraced. Most of the people I know are kinky, poly, and definitely queer, and I think all of those facets should be celebrated.</text>
