    <title>CMV: American cities are terribly designed and administered compared with European cities.</title>
    <original_poster>bostoninwinston</original_poster>
    <original_post>Most American cities are terrible compared to European ones. I'm not talking about big cities like NYC or SF- I mean the typical- the average- American city- is just awful by any objective comparison. You can go to out of the way cities in Italy or France, Germany or Belgium, and they build places as though their great-grandchildren would be proud to live there. Here, the average city has no city center, major monuments, or sense of history. In the US. there are few places to gather. The social life of American cities is incomparably lifeless compared to European cities. Our Cities are heavily segregated by race and economic class in the way European cities aren't. The architecture here is mostly corporatist modernism, and looks cookie-cutter. It quickly gets dated in the way the art of European cities don't. People here have to get around by car, and as a result are fatter and live shorter lives than the average European. Our unhealthiness contributes to our under-productivity. The average European city is vastly more productive than the average American one â€“ despite Europeans having dramatically more benefits, time off, vacations in, and shorter work hours on average. We damage our environment far more readily than European cities do. Our cities are designed often in conflict with the rule areas that surround them, whereas many European cities are built integrated into their environment. We spend more money on useless junk thank Europeans do. Our food isn't as good quality. Our water is often poisoned with lead and arsenic, and our storm drainage systems are easily overrun compared to European water management systems.  European cities are managing rising seas and the problems related to smog far better than American cities are. 

I can't think of a single way in which American cities are broadly speaking superior to European ones. Change my view.</original_post>

    <text>Plenty of segregation in european cities too. This idea that European Cities are all really well planned? laughable. The older parts of the cities predate the use of the car. Any thing with a wide road that predates that was. 

Also you cannot compare  "Europe" a collection of Countries with different languages Cultures and individual philosophies of government to the USA which is a single federal republic and a more coherent structure. Some European countries have cities that have been well planned some have have not they might have started the 20th century as being huge industrial centres but are now those jobs have gone as manufacturing moves to other countries.

It really comes down to local planning but mainly money. If the country is rich it have the money to spend  on designing new places to live but if they don't like most countries in Europe it is not great. none of the European cities were planned for their current population Apart from the richest countries like Norway Sweden Germany Netherlands Switzerland and parts of france.

That leaves the UK, most of france, Spain, Poland, Greece  and the rest of eastern Europe.

&amp;gt;European cities are built integrated into their environment

Nope just been there longer, it does give them a more lived in feel as you will see Architecture from different eras which is lovely. </text>
