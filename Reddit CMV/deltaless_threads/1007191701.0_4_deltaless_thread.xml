    <title>CMV: The raising of the minimum wage and globalisation has led to a decrease or in my country's case, an almost annihilation, in your typical "American" or for me "Australian" manufacturing at home.</title>

    <original_post>First off, I'm not saying that minimum wage and globalisation are a bad thing, so don't say I'm a protectionist, because I'm not.

The raising of the minimum wage and the increase of globalisation has led to a decrease in manufacturing because companies have realised it's cheaper to pay a Chinese guy 20 bucks a day than here in Australia where you have to pay a person with the same skills 20 bucks an hour. For businesses, it's not economically sustainable, so I'm sick of people asking why our manufacturing has declined because the answer is rather obvious. Australia has had even greater raises in the minimum wage to the US (workers must be paid 11.58 AUD in the US, and here in Australia you must pay the worker 19.49 AUD) which is why you will see at least a remnant of the once great manufacturing industry in the US, while here it has almost completely disappeared. The only places that Western regions lead in manufacturing are typically highly specialised industries where the skills needed by the worker are more valuable than their brute labour force. In conclusion, the raising of the minimum wage and globalisation has led to an decrease in manufacturing because it is cheaper to manufacture overseas. We are simply not competitive to manufacture at home.</original_post>

    <text>The main problem with the decrease in manufacturing jobs--at least when it comes to the United States--is not jobs going over seas , but in fact automation. Robots are cheaper and more efficient than humans will ever be when working leading to companies investing in automation. This is the main problem with manufacturing and there is no way to stop it. Think of the companies like Tesla which is using more automation or even highly specialized industries like Boeing. Before the 737 MAX fiasco their big sell to investors was a new machine that could do the work of ten humans for significantly less. It is true that some manufacturing jobs are going over seas but the bigger problem is the loss of jobs due to automation.</text>
