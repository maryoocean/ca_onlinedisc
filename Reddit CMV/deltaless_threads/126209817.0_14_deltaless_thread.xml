    <title>CMV: Money does buy happiness.</title>
    <original_poster>woflcopter</original_poster>
    <original_post>The term "money can't buy happiness" is, I think, false, mainly now within the past years. 

Let's give a scenario: you graduated college, got a decent $50k a year job and you live with your SO who makes around the same. Uh oh, student loans from college start to haunt you now, as well as car insurance, debt, mortgage, and maybe a dozen other things piling on top of that. Really the only way that you could "fix" this is by paying for it with money. 

And let's say that they somehow get a lot of money. And let's say they live in a world where there isn't really a tax or anything (think simple). They pay off all their debts and ironically all their money from that was the exact amount to pay everything off. They live much happier than before. 

And now you see how money buys happiness. It's true. Money does buy happiness. There are so many situations where money will solve your problems. I'm not trying to say how it's the only cause of happiness: there are things that can make people happy without the use of money, but generally if you have money it'll make you happier. I know that many people with tons of money are also depressed, but when you get a middle aged mid income family paying off all their debts and still being mid income, they are happy. Why? Because money.

    <text>The part about how stress over debts can bring unhappiness is true and often times the easy answer is money. But, life isn't all about money. The world tries its hardest to make things about money and that is due to its greed. 

Take for example you are in that situation: Decent salary, but it is difficult to get money. There are many routes you can take, but two examples I have personally seen where money was not the key to happiness stand out to me.

1)You are stuck in a dead end job, spouse works two jobs as well as you working your 40 hours weeks. Both take care of the children and you stress. Money won't appear out of thin air so now what. You feel like shit, you see no economic ladder to climb except the one in the shadows. You would ask you shady friend for a little help. He says he has work, and a job here and a job there and you'd quit. Or so you thought. The money is good, it is too easy to get and so you let that river run stright through your home and into your accounts. Pay off your debts, but your spouse doesn't at the least approve. Sheer disappointment and an eventual divorce. Custody over the kid is constantly stressed over but more time is spent with the mother. Well at least you paid off the debts?

2) On a happier note, debt was steep. It hurts to ask for help, but you do. Your parents are family and they are there for you. They will relinquish their savings to relieve you of your loan debts and provide you and your family a comfortable living arrangement. Do you know why they did that so fast? They love you, and in regards to family, it was nothing but paper. Now you could say money saved them, but it was more than just money. Money quenched the greed of the loan companies that charge 25% interest. But life is much more than just money and currency. It is family and all that is entailed; seeing your child smile, grow old with your partner, and love infinitely. Family saved you, your spouse, and your children. Not money.

Money is not the key to happiness. Though it can make things easier, everyone can admit at least that, but it don't mean jack shit by itself. Greed is the problem and love/family/friends is cure.

Phew, sorry for being so long winded. Cheers :)</text>
