    <title>CMV: It's fair to compare carnists (people who eat meat) to nazis.</title>
    <original_poster>Arkenhiem651</original_poster>
    <original_post>1) Carnists think that animals are inferior; Nazis think that jews are inferior
2) Carnists put animals in camps; Nazis put jews in camps
3) Both jews and animals attempt to escape
4) Both are/were normalized. Anyone who goes against these beliefs were/are suppressed and treated as illogical/emotionally driven
5) Both are unnecessary 
6) Both are/were driven long distances and murdered
7) emotional detachment from the victims
8) Both are sentient
Alex Hershaft a holocaust survivor also used this comparison along with other vegan holocaust survivors.
"We're focusing on the victims rather than the cancer of oppression itself",[8] and that "I noted with horror the striking similarities between what the Nazis did to my family and my people, and what we do to animals we raise for food: the branding or tattooing of serial numbers to identify victims, the use of cattle cars to transport victims to their death, the crowded housing of victims in wood crates, the arbitrary designation of who lives and who dies — the Christian lives, the Jew dies; the dog lives, the pig dies."[6

Also Alex Hershshaft looks extremely young considering he's 88 and survived concentration camps. That's irrelevant but I thought it interesting enough to mention considering he claims it's due to his vegan diet.

Edit: I know I say Jews but this also applies to other victims of the concentration camps such as Slavic peoples, gays and communists</original_post>

    <text>So, in your opinion, jews are basically the same thing as animals?

Because that's required for the comparison to work.</text>

    <text>Alex Hershshaft, a jewish holocaust survivor who I pointed out compared the holocaust and the animal industry obviously doesn't think so.</text>

    <text>If jews are not basically animals, there's the fundamental difference that one is happening to people and the other is happening to animals, and thus you can't compare them because you can't trivially compare people to animals.</text>

    <text>People are animals. Just because cows aren't as intelligent doesn't mean they deserve to be exploited and killed</text>

    <text>Correct. However, do people deserve to be exploited and killed ***less*** than cows?

It’s a fucked up analogy but a poignant one. Because the answer must be *yes*. 

The alternatives say that humans deserve to be exploited and killed about the same amount or more than cows. And those two are less acceptable propositions than the first.

If you had to put those three propositions in order from most acceptable to least acceptable, how would you order them?</text>

    <text>I'm not sure about the importance of that question, it's like asking "do children deserve to be exploited less than adults?" exploiting the former could be worse than the latter but it would never make the latter justifiable</text>
