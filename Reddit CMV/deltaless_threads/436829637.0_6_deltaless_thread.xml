    <title>CMV: Accusations alone should not be printed by the media.</title>
    <original_poster>OGHuggles</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't care what percentage of them are true, innocent till proven guilty is a thing. The erosion of privacy and civil liberties is of great concern to me now and in the future. While I'm glad plenty of women that would have been ignored before aren't anymore, I don't think accusations should be straight up believed. I think they should be taken seriously, but they should not get media attention until a case is actually made. 

False accusations are a thing and lives have been ruined because of them. The most infamous case of this guilty before proven innocent going wrong, is the Duke Lacross case I'm sure most people have heard of.

Why should I not be concerned about this? Why is it ok to ruin people's lives based off of accusations alone?

Yes, it is a thing *in court*.

If you see your child standing next to a broken vase, you will not wait for a court investigation and trial by jury before punishing them.

If your daughter tells you that one of the employees at your shop raped her, you won't let him keep working there until there's a full trial.

If HR gets sexual harassment complaints against you from 5 different women, they're going to kick your ass to the curb immediately, not after the jury weighs in.

The US criminal justice system requires extraordinary standards of evidence*as a safeguard* against misuse of government power, and in recognition of the extremity of the punishment it metes out.  

This is *not* some universal standard that should apply to all situations everywhere; the correct standard of evidence varies based on the consequences of a false positive vs. the consequences of a false negative.

    <text>And I'm not suggesting they should be, but in those cases, you tip the police off against this guy/gal and let them go quietly. You don't start a media shit storm.

    <text>How is suggesting that they do not pursue anything but law enforcement, and arguing elsewhere for "innocent till proven guilty," *not* suggesting that they should only be allowed to act on the standard of "beyond a reasonable doubt?" You can't claim that you are in favor of lesser standards for social punishment while arguing it's wrong to seek it.

And there is no contradiction between accusing or shunning somebody publicly and following up with a police investigation, *especially* if you know that "beyond a reasonable doubt" is an unattainable standard even with the truth on your side.</text>

    <text> If beyond a reasonable doubt cannot be obtained,  why do you think you find it acceptable to still allow them to suffer consequences? Did you consider the consequences of this?

/u/Milskidasith is a pedophile.  Contact their place of work and get them fired, because obtaining evidence beyond a reasonable doubt can't be obtained and they should suffer social consequences.</text>
