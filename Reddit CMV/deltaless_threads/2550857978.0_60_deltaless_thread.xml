    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>What do the police do? They don’t prevent crime. They don’t solve murders. They don’t find missing people.

SCOTUS has ruled they won’t be held accountable for violating your the 5th amendment (the Miranda warning). 

If you live close to a border, they don’t need any official to invade your space and ruin your life, they can do it just because they want to. And there’s nothing you can do about it.

When you get pulled over, if they’re allowed to search your car, they can destroy everything in it. They are allowed to do that. Same thing with your house.
