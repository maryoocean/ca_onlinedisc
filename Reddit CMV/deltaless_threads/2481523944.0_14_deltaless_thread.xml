    <title>cmv: Canada should install dirty atomic bombs in each big lake as an invasion deterrent.</title>
    <original_poster>maxi1134</original_poster>
    <original_post>With the upcoming climate changes and the fact that Canada has 20% of the freshwater reserve in the world. Russia, America, and other states might have an interest in invading Canada to access the water reserves and the Canadian north that will taw out and become available for crops.    
  

With this information, I believe that rigging the water table to be radioactive for eons in case of invasion would be the perfect deterrent to prevent the invasion from any other state.   

  

Especially America, as their water table would then also be contaminated</original_post>

    <text>I'm trying to understand how this is an invasion deterrent.

If the situation gets bad enough that it's worth invading over water, then wouldn't that stand to reason that the lack of access to water is what's starting the war?

That would mean that the risk for even a minor fraction of the water would be worth the invasion- even if majority is irradiated.

In exchange, you also guarantee that Canada is permanently screwed in the future. The invading nation holds onto the few water sources available (if any) and the remaining water is now irradiated leaving the actual Canadians to die from dehydration.</text>
