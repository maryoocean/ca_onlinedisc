    <title>CMV: I think masturbation is bad for you.</title>
    <original_poster>TextingWhileDriving</original_poster>
    <original_post>I used to be part of the /r/NoFap community and felt good about it. I had a sense of pride when a day passed without masturbation squeezed in there. However, I never went longer than 2 weeks without masturbating. Each time I masturbated I felt a sense of dread and depression, knowing I would just masturbate again sometime later. 

Today I broke my 4 day streak. I feel depressed and stressed. This basically confirms how I felt about masturbation in the beginning. It's bad for you. You could change my view with study's or from experience yourself. Go ahead and try changing my view. </original_post>

This doesn't follow.

"I thought [x] was bad. When I did it, I felt bad. Therefore [x] was bad."

This is somewhat circular, for one thing. For another thing ... if you *feel like something is bad*, then doing it will *make you feel guilty*. So it's a self-fulfilling prophecy, in that regard.</text>
