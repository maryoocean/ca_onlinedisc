    <title>CMV: If I'm not guilty, I want to be tried by a judge rather than a jury</title>
    <original_poster>Mimshot</original_poster>
    <original_post>In the American criminal justice system you have the *right* to a jury trial, but you are not obligated to exercise your right a jury. It's possible to have what's known as a "bench trial" where in addition to determining the admissibility of evidence, and sentencing if convicted, the judge determines guilt or innocence as well.

Jury trials are notoriously unpredictable, therefore if I'm actually not guilty of a crime, I want a professional judging my case. Historically, bench trials result in acquittals [more often than from juries](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/judge_v_judge). I understand wanting to be judged by someone who never saw inadmissible evidence, if I'm guilty but the evidence was illegally obtained, but if I'm actually not guilty, why should I take a chance with a jury?

Change my view.

    <text>You do not get a variety of judges like a jury, you get 1 judge and you have no control. You could get a very lenient judge or a judge who is looking to give you the max possible. Comparing bench trials to jury trials is a bit ridiculous by numbers as the sample sizes are extremely out weighing on the jury trials. This is important as most repeat offenders and lesser crimes (high volume) are jury trials which are more often guilty than someone who is willing to risk 1 person deciding their fate.

A jury must have no doubt that you committed the crime otherwise they will acquit you of the charges. Plus if you aren't being framed you most likely have a good case on why you are innocent. A singular person like a judge may decide they don't like you or ignore certain facts to say you are guilty, in a bench trial you would be convicted. However even if a few people are convinced, the rest of the jury can sway them/will prevent wrongful conviction. I am not saying it is full proof but would you rather flip a coin for your freedom or flip a coin 6 times?</text>
