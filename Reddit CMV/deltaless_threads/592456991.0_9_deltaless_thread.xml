    <title>CMV: Some cultural traditions don't deserve respect and outsiders should actively make an attempt to change them.</title>

I came across this video today, in which brides in a certain culture are kidnapped of the streets and are physically held and forced into marriage by their family (sometimes even just their distant extended family). In many cultures there are many flaws but almost all modern societies don't condone the forced kidnap and eventual rape of women. This culture will continue to cause real tangible and direct harm to individuals unless it is somehow changed from external pressure. This tradition doesn't deserve to be respected and deserves active attempts to destroy it by well meaning outsiders. I am trying to see if there is any argument behind the common view of "we must respect all cultures". I don't see how or why a culture that deprives people of fundamental human rights deserves respect, and how it is not the duty of outsiders to try to stop them. Change my view </original_post>

    <text>Here's my concern with you stance. I believe this is exactly what many European settlers believed they were doing when they wiped out indigenous cultures and converted them to Christianity. Your view is predicated on the notion that you understand this culture and the reasons for its practices more completely than the members of that culture and/or your morals are inherently superior to their entire culture's. Like, you can say "But we were ignorant and wrong back then, now that we've solved morality we can safely do this" but like... they probably thought the same thing about their previous culture so... have we? Is our culture devoid of problematic practices? Do you trust the most extreme members of the political party in your culture that you most disagree with to be the ones to spearhead this effort to cause cultural change? Do you think they trust you to?

Is the practice described in that video awful? Possibly, but according to another poster here it's actually consensual and everyone is in on the bit including the girl. Imagine if someone from another culture saw the American practice of asking the parents of the bride permission to ask their daughter out and decided to get outraged and change it "This culture still treats its women as their parents property! Even as an adult a man is required to go ask permission to wed the daughter not from her but from her FATHER! Barbaric!" and came chastising us for our awful practices when actually people who still engage in that practice mostly do so as a formality or polite token gesture to their future parent in laws and are going to ask the girl out anyways. 

Alternatively, imagine a communist nation looked to the USA and said "They let people just starve to death on the streets because they can't find a job! How evil! We need to go convert them to the right way of thinking!" and came to make an active attempt to change our capitalists traditions. Is that a desirable state of affairs? Like... when we imagine these things going down, we generally imagine we're the culture doing the attempting to change, but how would you feel if you were the culture being changed? ESPECIALLY with the history western culture has of imposing itself on other cultures?</text>
