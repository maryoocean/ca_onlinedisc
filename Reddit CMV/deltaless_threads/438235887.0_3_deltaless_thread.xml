    <title>CMV: If gender is a social construct, then so is race</title>
    <original_poster>BoppeBoye</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let us take, as a given, that gender is divorced from the circumstances of your birth, that it is not a mental illness, and that there is no biological basis for what gender identity someone should express. Have I phrased that effectively? I'm trying to be concise, but I want to portray that premise correctly.

Why, then, should race be different than gender? If race carries with it "shared experience" and "lived experience", etc - that assumes that the only way you could understand what it's like to be a minority is to have lived your entire life as that particular minority. I'm not arguing against that, I agree that there are certain experiences that I could not comprehend - for instance, overbearing &amp;amp; strict Asian parents with exceedingly high expectations. 

But, if someone can change their gender or decide (?) that they identify as a different gender without having the prior lived experience of said gender, then why can't someone identify as a different race?

I'm not able to encompass all the variables which could lead someone to identify as another gender, but is it not possible for someone to come to the same conclusion with their race? What if an Indian man grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood, saw or experienced the same (or similar) discrimination as them, had minimal exposure to Indian culture; and this led him to conclude that he identifies more closely as a black man, rather than Indian? 

I would also like to cite Rachel Dolezal, who was uniformly mocked for being (afaik) the first trans-black woman in the public eye. It seems similar to transgender discrimination to me, assuming that there is something wrong with her mentally for deciding to become a black woman... Anyway, I'm not really defending her because that's not really in line with what I described in the previous paragraph (she grew up privileged IIRC), but the public reaction of mockery goes against the leftist belief of acceptance, by my perspective.

So, in short, why can there be no such thing as trans-racial people, the same way there are transgender?

    <text>I'd say anyone who has a problem with Rachel Dolezal's blackness.

Sean "Talcum X" White fits in here too... 

They both obviously identify as black, but instead of being praised for their bravery, they're mocked for it, or worse... shamed(in Dolezal's case)</text>

    <text>I think you are confusing the term social construct as meaning something that is whatever someone decides. 

By way of illustrating this, money is a social construct. That doesn't mean however that one can decide how much money they have, or what should and shouldn't count as money. 

I don't have a comment on the two individuals you mentioned, but something being a social construct does not necessarily mean that it is arbitrarily decided upon by individuals in isolation. </text>

    <text>Money is a great example!

Money is most certainly a social Construct. As such, society has determined the value of each denomination (based on the number physically printed on it), that value is not determined by an individual person who has the bill. A $20 does not become $100 or $1, simply because the owner gets confused and thinks it is.

See where this is going?

The same is true of Gender. Society (based on physical biology) determine's a person's gender... not how the individual feels, or what they prefer it to be. 

The same is also true of Race, Society (based on appearance) determines an individual's race. not the individual themselves. My kids, for instance, are half Hispanic, but look white and as such are treated by everyone they meet as white. Their cousins who are also half hispanic, look hispanic and are thus judged, by society, to be hispanic.

A social construct is determined by Society... not by the individual, no matter how much we might wish that $20 was a $100.</text>

    <text>Sure, I can see your point. 

However, unlike money, someone's genuine desire to be treated in a manner aligned with what they feel to be their gender identity doesn't really harm anyone elses experience. Also there really isn't a mint out there which makes someone a certain sex with the explicit understanding that this will end up being a certain gender. Further, it actually makes little sense to associate gender with sex given the massively different kinds of expression and behaviors associated with men and women across time.  So although I stand by money being a social construct to illustrate that it isn't willy nilly, as a metaphor it also suggests that social constructs are dynamic across time to adapt to our better understanding of how these constructs can be used to improve the lives of those in society.

Just as we moved away from the gold standard for dollar bills to support more economic stability, we might also move away from sex based gender assignment in society to help some individuals be healthier and happier. That would require a change in how everyone participates in creating the social construct of gender, but I believe doing so is likely better for all involved.

In this case, people are essentially saying that the application of this social construct is damaging to people who have a deep seated feeling of being a different gender. Which, as some of the links in the above comments indicate, may be driven by neurobiological factors. 

I really don't know if we have enough evidence of the experience of race dysphoria, or even, if it does occur, whether it caused the kind of misery and damage that many who are trans report experiencing.

I'm of the opinion that with RD, its probably not that big of deal either way. I hope she is happy and healthy regardless of how she wants to express herself to the world.  That said, I suspect that some of the ire towards her may come from fears of appropriation, which again is something I am pretty out of depth on.

 However, I think it is telling that the one prominent case of apparent trans racialism is constantly used as a means of arguing against the idea of a more inclusive means of establishing gender.

TLDR: I argue that as gender is a social construct, it is not willy nilly or strictly biologically determined, and as such can be modified to include trans folks to their preferred genders with little harm to others. This is because we have pretty large amount of evidence suggesting individuals experience hardship from our current use of gender. Such evidence is not as strong in the case of race, and as such may not warrant the recomposition of how we decide on the race of others. However, I suspect that the prominence of this case largely comes from a desire to participate in the changing of the social construct of gender to accommodate those who identify as trans.</text>
