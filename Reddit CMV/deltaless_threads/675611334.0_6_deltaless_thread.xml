    <title>CMV: If the Polish-Soviet annexation of the eastern German territories following World War 2 was justified, then so too is the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights</title>
    <original_poster>SpacemanSkiff</original_poster>
    <original_post>The Golan Heights were occupied by Israel following a defensive war against a coalition of Arab nations including Syria, the nation formerly in control of the aforementioned Heights. Following the Israeli victory, they occupied the Heights as a matter of national security, and have recently been moving to annex them formerly.

Many people say that this annexation is unwarranted, unjust, or illegal. However, precedence shows that this is not the case. Following World War 2, the USSR and Poland annexed about a fourth of Germany, and forcibly expelled some ten million people from their homes (including those expelled from other neighboring nations like Czechia). International law views this annexation as valid.

If international law views the annexation of Eastern Germany by a nation that had been on the receiving end of aggression as valid, then it follows that the annexation of the Golan Heights by a nation that had been on the receiving end of aggression is likewise valid.

Either both are valid, or both are invalid.

    <text>IMO Israel is an illegitimate state, so any land it takes is unjustified, but letâ€™s say Israel is a legit state, then it would still not be justified because the Soviet annexation was also frowned on by the allies.</text>

    <text>I am, in fact, assuming that Israel is a legitimate state.

If it were true that the annexation of the Eastern German territories was opposed by the international community at large, then they wouldn't have pushed for Germany to sign a treaty with Poland settling the border at the Oder-Neisse line.</text>
