    <title>CMV: Sustainability, from a philosophical perspective, is misguided</title>
    <original_poster>Pyropeace</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've been an advocate of sustainability for a while. However, I've recently begun to question the underlying assumptions behind the sustainability movement. 

Nothing is truly, infinitely sustainable. The sun will eventually go nova, killing everyone on earth (if humans haven't already gone extinct by then). If humanity manages to escape Earth, then the universe will likely perish as well, depending on what model you accept. The universe is in a constant state of change, and nothing lasts forever. Is it better to be moderately happy for a long period of time or extremely happy for a short period of time? When talking about entire societies, I tend towards the latter, though on an individual basis I tend towards the former. 

Essentially, my question is this; what is the value in things that last a long time in a universe where nothing is eternal?</original_post>

    <text>For the life of humanity we can consider certain things to be practically, if not actually eternal. Humanity is more likely to be evolved and/or a legitimate space-faring, interplanetary species before we have to worry about the sun going nova. Many other things cannot be considered eternal in a practical sense.

Many people have chosen your “extremely happy for a short period of time” because that short period of time is their entire life. The problem becomes that because of their short-term choices affect the next generation’s short period of time. We are being asked to be moderately happy for a short period of time so that future generations can also be moderately happy for a short period of time.</text>
