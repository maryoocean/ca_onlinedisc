    <title>CMV: Poverty may actually cause permanent racial IQ disparities</title>
    <original_poster>Laniekea</original_poster>
    <original_post>I know. It sounds FUKIN terrible. But there is a lot of evidence that is pointing in this direction, and I'm *hoping* somebody to convince me otherwise. 

First, let's start by saying that there is a significant amount of evidence that shows that poverty has a negative impact on IQ. Which shouldn't really be too surprising. Stress, lack of sleep, poor eating or exercise, unhealthy food inhibit brain function. Poverty causes all those things. Minorities are more likely to experience poverty. That part isn't really controversial, there is a notable difference between poor and wealthy children's IQ. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4641149/#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20children%20from%20low%20SES,this%20difference%20had%20almost%20tripled.

There's really massive twin studies that have found that IQ is at least partially hereditary.

On top of that, there's also evidence that poverty actually damages genes. 

https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2019/04/poverty-leaves-a-mark-on-our-genes/#:~:text=They%20discovered%20that%20lower%20socioeconomic,the%20genes%20in%20the%20genome.

And this is kind of the part where I'm hoping people can convince me otherwise. Because I don't understand that much about DNA and I'm hoping people can either show me a study that definitively proved otherwise, or can explain DNA a little better so that I can understand. 

My hypothesis is that multiple centuries of consistent poverty, slavery, abuse in Africa, wars in the middle east, poverty in India has done so much damage to genes that it is actually causing minorities to be born with a lower average IQ. 

I would love if somebody knew of maybe a multi racial adopted sibling study,  or a study that found another way controlled for poverty that found no difference.</original_post>

    <text>IQ is pretty close to be a pseudoscience as is, and the idea that IQ is specifically determined by DNA is absolutely a pseudoscience. Even if you're right that poverty damages DNA that doesn't mean that poverty permanently makes certain races dumber.

Like, remember that most of the world was poor by our reckoning just 100 years ago. 100 years is nothing in terms of genetics. It'd be absurd to claim that 100 years of 'wars in the middle east' caused problems for them but the literal Hundred Years War caused no problems for the Europeans.</text>

The middle east has thousands of years. 

The argument that IQ is pseudoscience is probably not going to cmv. There's just too much data showing it closely tied to various outcomes.</text>

    <text>Money is also tied to various outcomes. It's also highly heritable. But you'd never say that hiring or admitting students based on wealth is meritocratic.</text>

Western Europe being somewhat politically stable is an incredibly new turn of events. WW2 was devastating for the continent and happened not even 100 years ago and it's not like the post-war era was all rainbows and sunshine. The reunification of Germany happened in 1990.</text>

    <text>I can't say much, but from far i know what happens in your life doesn't affect your DNA.

The "law of use and disuse" by Lamarck is already proven false, therefore if get *dumbier*, it's dont go affect the offspring. **IQ doesn't mean intelligence.**

I understand your point, but i dont go call it ***permanent.***</text>

There's an article in the OP that discussed a study about this.</text>
