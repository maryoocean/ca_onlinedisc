    <title>CMV: It's fair to compare carnists (people who eat meat) to nazis.</title>
    <original_poster>Arkenhiem651</original_poster>
    <original_post>1) Carnists think that animals are inferior; Nazis think that jews are inferior
2) Carnists put animals in camps; Nazis put jews in camps
3) Both jews and animals attempt to escape
4) Both are/were normalized. Anyone who goes against these beliefs were/are suppressed and treated as illogical/emotionally driven
5) Both are unnecessary 
6) Both are/were driven long distances and murdered
7) emotional detachment from the victims
8) Both are sentient
Alex Hershaft a holocaust survivor also used this comparison along with other vegan holocaust survivors.
"We're focusing on the victims rather than the cancer of oppression itself",[8] and that "I noted with horror the striking similarities between what the Nazis did to my family and my people, and what we do to animals we raise for food: the branding or tattooing of serial numbers to identify victims, the use of cattle cars to transport victims to their death, the crowded housing of victims in wood crates, the arbitrary designation of who lives and who dies — the Christian lives, the Jew dies; the dog lives, the pig dies."[6

Also Alex Hershshaft looks extremely young considering he's 88 and survived concentration camps. That's irrelevant but I thought it interesting enough to mention considering he claims it's due to his vegan diet.

Edit: I know I say Jews but this also applies to other victims of the concentration camps such as Slavic peoples, gays and communists</original_post>

    <text>Your argument rests on a false equivalence where homo erectus and all other animals are equated. They can't be. There are significant differences between different animal species. Not the least of which is intelligence and cognition.

&amp;gt;Both are/were driven long distances and murdered

The animals are killed. Murder requires that the killing be illegal.</text>

    <text>So jews weren't murdered, they were killed?</text>

    <text>I'm honestly not familiar with German and international law during the 1930s and 1940s, so can't really say. If it wasn't illegal, do you think it not being murder somehow undermines the tragedy and the atrocity?</text>

    <text>Then why use the word murder for something that isn't an illegal killing? You're clearly trying to strike a chord by using the word, and it makes point 6 incorrect.

Also, the whole false equivalence.</text>
