    <title>CMV: Religion is just Peer Pressure from Your Parents</title>
    <original_poster>siddharth_pillai</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't think most people believe in their religion. Nor do they believe in the gods they worship. They simply believe in whatever their parents believe. If you're a theist reading this, ask yourself whether you'd still follow your current religion if your parents were Islamic?

You can speculate yourself, don't you think its more likely that you would be Islamic too? If your parents were Hindus, wouldn't you be a Hindu? If your great grandparents were Sikhs wouldn't your parents and in turn you also be a Sikh?

It may not be true for all but its true for an overwhelming majority of people.

Edit: I'm getting some answers asking about people who convert or have non religious parents, my views don't apply to these people</original_post>

    <text>You are correct saying that most people believe in their religion because their parents do. However, that’s because most young people do not have the interest or capability to understand religion fully to make up their own mind. Many people seek religion when they get older. 

Saying “Religion is just peer pressure from your parents” is like saying “being a doctor is just peer pressure from your parents”. It is true that many kids become doctors because their parents want them to, but there is a great amount of people who wants to become doctor themselves.</text>
