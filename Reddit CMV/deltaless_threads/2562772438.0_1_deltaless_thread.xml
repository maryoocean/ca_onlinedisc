    <title>CMV: It is illogical to not believe in Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>LAMARR__44</original_poster>
    <original_post>Many people either believe in Hard Determinism or Compatibilism. I will argue that both are illogical.

Both argue that human actions are extensions of factors we do not have a choice over. Compatibilism seems to say we are still free but just redefines free will to the internal factors behind a decision, but the decision is still decided by a chain of events outside of our control.

My argument is a sort of wager argument. Either libertarian free will exists or it doesn’t. If it exists and we believe in it, we have made a free decision where we are right. If libertarian free will doesn’t exist, the decision to believe in libertarian free will was out of our control.

So either we have a choice and we can make the right choice, or we don’t have a choice and were determined to be wrong.

Thus it makes more sense to believe in libertarian free will since it’s potentially the only one where we have a chance to make a right choice, if determinism is true there is no choice, so there’s no value in being right.</original_post>

    <text>A "wager" style argument only makes sense if there's something to wager. In Pascal's Wager, the idea is that you get eternal paradise if you're right and risk eternal damnation if you're wrong. Now, that argument has its own issues, but the wager aspect is at least coherent.

But in your example, there's nothing at stake. You don't get anything for "making the right choice", so I'm not sure how this is even an argument.

If I think "determinism is true there is no choice, so there’s no value in being right" is *true*, why would I pretend otherwise?</text>

    <text>Because belief in free will has been shown to have its own benefits.</text>

    <text>Such as? And I guess to be more specific, what are the benefits of believing in free will versus being a compatibility? I could see the argument against someone saying "I don't have a choice so what's the point", but that's *not* the mindset of a compatibilist.</text>

    <text>Sorry, I linked it on another comment but forgot to link it here.

Believing in free will has its own value. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5209362/#:~:text=Free%20will%20is%20not%20only,large%20samples%20of%20Chinese%20adolescents.

Free will is not only an abstract concept for philosophers; it also plays a vital role in laypersons’ daily life. In the present study, we found that a stronger belief in free will was associated with increased life satisfaction and PA in two independent large samples of Chinese adolescents.

Belief in free will has benefits but it may create cognitive dissonance just to believe in something for its pragmatic value. But when we get to the action of believing, we can either think of it as an action we can choose or something out of our control. If we think of it as free, we are either right and thus we were free to choose it, or we are wrong and in that case there was no other way to believe.</text>

    <text>First off, if you read what was actually done in this study, this conclusion, particularly your summary of it that "believing in free will has its own value" is an overreach. The correlation they find isn't that surprising on its own, and it doesn't come close to even considering the nuances of compatibility. Basically the whole point of compatibilism is that there's no reason to throw out concepts like responsibility and self determination. None of this is going to come through in those survey questions though.

It's also dubious the extent that you could actually change your belief in a meaningful way using your wager-style argument. At best, it basically leads to compatibilism. The idea being you take someone who believes in the determinism of the world, and then try to convince them that they should still adopt aspects of the free will mindset *because of these psychological benefits*. You may be able to change their attitudes in a positive way, but it's unlikely that this is going to change their beliefs about how physics works!</text>

    <text>If you accept the wager it only shows that it is *better to believe that you have free will* not that *free will actually exists* one is a statement about reality, another is a statement about optimal states of mind, these are very different things.</text>

    <text>Is your argument that even if free will is fake, we ought to believe in free will because it has psychological benefits? If so, I just disagree and think it’s mainly a matter of principles (which are hard to debate). I think we ought to believe things not because they are comforting, but because they are true.</text>

    <text>But how does having benefits make it true? If you believe something it should be because you genuinely believe it to be true, not because you think it's beneficial to believe it</text>

    <text>There is something to wager: everything on which free will depends (I.e. morality, justifiable rewards and punishments, our entire criminal justice system, etc.).  

If we gave up free will, we’d have to give up these things too, rationally speaking.</text>

    <text>You don't though! Compatibilists have no reason even in theory to give up any of them. Non-compatibilists might have to reject some of the more abstract aspects of morality, but all of the actual rules and norms and structures have pragmatic reasons to keep them.</text>

    <text>Sure, I agree with that, but I don’t think the majority of people are compatibilists or agree with the compatibilists’ re-conceptualization of free will.  

Insofar as I believe the majority of people are non-compatibilists, the majority of people are wagering something some betting on free will’s existence or non-existence.  

But it may be in fact that the majority of people are campatibilists — I’m not certain haha.</text>

    <text>Majority of what group of people? All people? Just people who don't believe in free will? 

Plus, in your view, isn't this as much an argument for compatibilism as it is for free will? This is actually where my thread with OP ended up. To the extent that this "wager" makes any sense, it's more likely to drive people towards compatibilism. It's basically saying "look at all these psychological and societal benefits of having a conception of choice and free will", but it doesn't really make much sense that it would influence anyone's model of how the underlying *physics* work.</text>
