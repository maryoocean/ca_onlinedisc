    <title>CMV: Activists should abandon the phrase "white privilege" because it alienates white people who didn't grow up wealthy</title>
    <original_poster>ShiningConcepts</original_poster>
    <original_post>Blacks are [more than twice as likely to grow up in poverty](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;amp;sortModel=%7B"colId":"Location","sort":"asc"%7D), [disproportionately sentenced for the same crimes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/16/black-men-sentenced-to-more-time-for-committing-the-exact-same-crime-as-a-white-person-study-finds/?utm_term=.b0e81ca325dc), [several percentage points ahead in terms of unemployment statistics](https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpsee_e16.htm), prone disproportionately to police arrests incl. for nonviolent drug usage, and the list goes on. There are a wide variety of issues minority rights activists bring up that are legitimate - I'm not here to dispute those. I fully support that fight.

My view here is that the usage of the phrase "white privilege" is wrong and should be retired. Many upper class white people are privileged as they are immune to the ripple effects of a racist history (and the modern day effects of racist police departments and shitty schools in minority neighborhoods). But for the poor white ones, which there are many, the phrase white privilege should be abandoned. Because it minimizes and implies less importance for the suffering countless poor white people had to go through - while blacks are disproportionately victims of all the things i mentioned, some whites are the victims of them to.

I understand why a white person who suffered hardship in their life would feel alienated by hearing someone throw around the term "white privilege" - the term asserts there is a privilege in being white. There is privilege in being rich, but not solely in being white. So, the term should be abandoned in the interest of not alienating poor white people from a legitimate movement that has legitimate concerns.

    <text>First, your argument that "there is privilege in being rich, but not solely in being white" is not true. Even you admit it with some of your stats; being disproportionately sentenced for the same crimes is much more due to race than economics. Being treated differently while driving the same car is a function of race, not economics. Being less likely to get an interview with the same resume because of your name is a function of race, not of economics. There is absolutely privilege in being white, everything else equal, and discarding that for the palatable falsehood that it's purely class issues does not help anybody.

Second, "white privilege", as a term, can reach people who are willing to listen in a way merely talking about hardships doesn't. It forces white people who "aren't racist" but never think about race relations to examine how things they take for granted are not universal for people with different skin colors. I know that personally, flipping my thinking from "why would people explicitly target black people?" to "what if society only seems as friendly as it is because they are naturally at ease around white people" was critical in developing my own opinions on race relations. I think the term offers a valuable perspective that can't be obtained just by talking about how badly certain people are treated.</text>

Then why is it that there are plenty of plighted white people? Yes, they are less likely to get stopped while driving, but that doesn't change the fact that they've gone through enormous hardship in their lives.

That is true, but telling all white people (which the term "white privilege" implies since it's only specifier is the word "white") that they are privileged ignores the economic and police/prison issues that affect them as well.

&amp;gt; It forces white people who "aren't racist" but never think about race relations to examine how things they take for granted are not universal for people with different skin colors.

And that's good... for white people who do have things they can take for granted. But what about poor white people who have next to nothing?</text>
