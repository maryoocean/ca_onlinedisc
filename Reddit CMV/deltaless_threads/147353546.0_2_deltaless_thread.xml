    <title>CMV: I believe that there should be no penalty for Excessive Celebration in the NFL</title>
    <original_poster>mrspuff202</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have no idea why there are excessive celebration rules in the NFL rule book. If a player has done something exceptional, they should be allowed to celebrate as they wish as long as: A) they don't aggress upon a player on the other team (which is taunting) and B) the celebration doesn't run on for a ridiculous amount of time. These celebrations are fun bits of creativity and flair that allow the players to express their personality and ingenuity and make the game much more fun to watch.

A counterargument that I already foresee: What kind of example does that set for kids?

My answer: Actually a pretty good one. For one, there is a major difference between celebrating and taunting that even a child can understand: one is mean, and any four year old could make that distinction. But celebrations are a big part of why I played football, basketball, baseball, etc. as a kid. The batflip after a homerun, thumping my chest like Paul Pierce after nailing an improbable three: it teaches them to strive to be the best that they can be and to be happy when they succeed. Celebration of one's good deeds is a very good trait to have.

That's my view. Change my view, Reddit! Or else, Goodell will be getting a sternly worded letter from me.

    <text>I agree with on caveat.  Excessive celebrations that delay the game, aka the Jimmy Graham dunk that broke the goalposts last year.

Additionally the stupid ball spin that some players do after a big play can cause the ball to move away from the refs slowing down the return to the LoS.  Other than that I would love to see more celebrations.

Go Hawks.</text>

You had my upvote until there. Just kidding.

I don't understand the problem beyond what you describe, either. Whatever teams do to get the conversion play started 40 seconds after the touchdown is their own business.

Apparently this is the conflict between schools of thought in baseball and everything else. Baseball has [rules of "decorum"](http://deadspin.com/a-major-league-pitchers-guide-to-baseballs-bullshit-unw-1585433770) that make it not OK to celebrate a home runâ€”so much so that beaning the hitter on his next at-bat is considered meting justice. [Anything goes in soccer](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3wK_v9koL3Y), yet it hasn't devolved into a pit of moral depravity. Baseball isn't a model I'd want to follow, either way.</text>
