    <title>CMV: Most people are not well read enough to reasonably advocate for political or economic change</title>

    <original_post>**Edit: "Well read" was a poor choice of words. I think "have done their due diligence" might be more accurate.**

I'm writing this because I want to be proven wrong, because people saying political things, especially as if obvious has started to annoy and anger me more. Especially if they're making fun of someone for their political views, even if I disagree with those views. I hate feeling angry, so hopefully writing my thoughts out will help.

In trying to figure out my own political views, I've come to realize that I can't reasonably hold the views I held, or any other views. I studied economics, mainly the school of thought that appealed to me. But then more and more I came to realize that I couldn't say if the Keynesian or post-keynesian or the Chicago school or MMT etc. were correct, and that even people who devote their lives to the study of economics struggle with the same thing. The same thing happened in philosophy, especially as I came to realize the importance of epistemology and ontology.

And you can't reasonably expect people to put in the effort and time that it takes to sort through these fields. And that there is still such debate among the experts that even if you become and expert, the truth will not be obvious. I've come to understand what Socrates meant when he said something like "I only know that I know nothing".

I've also come to believe that people hold the beliefs they do more for social reasons. Less for the truth of the beliefs, but more because their reaffirm their identity, and their social bonds.

I can't blame them for that, or for not spending thousands of hours sorting through political thought, philosophy and economics. But a part of me still believes that they haven't done their due diligence, and I get angry that they can affirm themselves and their beliefs, while I sit here uncertain, unable to succinctly articulate why, or how to get this across properly.</original_post>

    <text>OP, most people have not done their due diligence, just as you've described.  You'll go insane if you fight against that notion.  You're right.  It sucks, but you're right. However, the reasons for this are socioeconomic and primarily relate to their upbringing (or lack thereof).  They do do due diligence...just on different topics.

For us to establish and maintain a society which discourages free discussion of complex topics by those who lack the "due diligence" to **actually** comprehend is simply unfeasible.  Plus, there are definitely aspects of our world which you and I, people who contemplate the big questions very deeply, are actually totally oblivious of.  Many of these aspects are only apparent to the poor and educationally deprived.

People may not do their due diligence on climate change and political change, but many of us who ponder such questions don't do our due diligence on other matters.  We simply have to accept that people prioritize causes based on the degree to which their Mazlow Hierarchy is currently met or not met.</text>
