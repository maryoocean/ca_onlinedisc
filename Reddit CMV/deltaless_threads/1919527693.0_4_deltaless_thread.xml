    <title>CMV: Downfall of News Networks is a Good Thing</title>
    <original_poster>mindtug</original_poster>
    <original_post>News thrives off fear mongering which has been detrimental for America. For instance ‘stranger danger’ caused kids across America to be locked indoors which isn’t great for development and mental health because the fear of some van taking them away, while the likelihood of your kids being kidnapped is actually extremely low. Same thing with tough on crime that went overboard causing mass incarceration and lengthened prison times making America have the biggest prisoner poppulation in the world. News talk about “How we’re more divided than ever” but they’re probably the biggest contributors. It’s important to know what’s happening but global networks such as CNN and Fox are too sensational for me to support. Should I feel sad they’re dying?</original_post>

    <text>To state that just because we couldn't manage our airtime better, it's a good thing that we can't have reliable sources of information is silly to me. It's like throwing away your coat instead of zipping it up, because you were cold when it was unzipped anyway. Your situation hasn't improved,  but you've removed the only thing close to helping it, because you refused to use it properly. 

Many nations have similar issues of media going for what's most captivating and scandalous, because that's how they get the biggest audience, and make the most money from advertising. But that doesn't mean that news media can't be done correctly. The criteria for good news coverage is well known. Some places enforce it better than us, is all. 

It's actually still fixable, too. There's just no political will in fixing it, because the flawed mediascape is serving our broken political apparatus. But with the fall of news media, all you'll have is social media, cause that garbage is here to stay. And I'm sure you've noticed that it's somehow possibly a step worse than even the atrocious, mismanaged, disgusting abomination which our news media (and i do mean our - it's our collective national airwaves they're polluting).</text>
