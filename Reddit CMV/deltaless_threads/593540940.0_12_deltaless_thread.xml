    <title>CMV: Tipping makes no sense</title>
    <original_poster>adashofasshole</original_poster>
    <original_post>The general logic I hear behind tipping is because the driver or waiter does not make enough money. 

Well how is it the consumers fault that they are not making enough money? I can see the fault being placed on the employer for not paying enough, or even the company, but to place the responsibility on the consumer is completely lost to me. It would make more sense to me to even blame the employee for not working harder to find a better paying job (not the main point). 

The equivalent would be expecting kids to bring in money to give to underpaid teachers, which makes a lot more sense to me as students in public schools are not paying teachers for their service. 

Please, change my view. 

Edit: I still give my fair share of tips, also I understand it is not mandatory but it is highly frowned upon when someone doesnâ€™t tip. </original_post>

    <text>If all waiters and bartenders were paid minimum wage, expect the quality of service to go way down everywhere. Tipping allows a restaurant to employ a highly skilled, experienced server who, without tipping, would find another career. At a nice restaurant, 15% of the tab can be a very nice wage. If tips go away, considering the thin margins of profit on most restaurants, I'd expect the restaurant to pass on the wage increase to the consumer anyway, and probably not as much.

So if you enjoy having a highly experienced waiter, accept tipping.</text>
