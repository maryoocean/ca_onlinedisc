    <title>I believe real Christians died out centuries ago, CMV.</title>

    <original_post>That is to say, if real Christians ever existed in the first place. If you are a Christian, you must follow the teachings of the bible. You must follow the teachings of Christ. A real follower of any religion should follow that religion, not pick and choose what bits interest them. As soon as you can say "this works" and "this doesn't", you're not following the rules!

I believe anyone who works on the Sabbath, has piercings or tattoos, wears cotton/polyester blends, has a same-sex relationship, allows a woman to teach, or allows a woman to speak in church, etc. And says they're a Christian is lying.

I am certainly not saying that anyone should actually follow these rules, but I am convinced you are simply being dishonest if you call yourself a Christian, or a member of any religion, without following the rules that were clearly put out to you under that religion. Anyone that chooses to nit-pick the parts of their religion that they choose to follow is nothing more than a deist with a book they like. You are not a follower unless you are a follower!

Update: Between /u/TheophilusOmega and /u/Ausfall my view has changed. I feel the easiest way for me to word this is my analogy that the Bible is not a rulebook to Christians, but a textbook. They don't follow it to a T because they don't have to. Jesus' teachings is the lesson, and the Bible is the textbook in which his teachings and the Biblical historical relevance is told. Assuming that a Christian must follow the rules of the Bible exactly, else they are not a 'true' believer, is fallacious reasoning as shown by /u/ausfall, and between the two of them I've learned what actually separates following the Holy Book to following the Religion itself. I feel the points were put across strongest and clearest by these two Redditors, but thank you to everyone else who contributed.</original_post>

    <text>Being Christian is based upon the teachings of Jesus, correct? And the Old Testament too, yes? The OT was written by Jews, FOR Jews. Jesus, as a Jew, learned all 613 "laws" mentioned in the OT. 

The interpretation is not of "Which do I want to follow?", but instead, we interpret what Jesus meant by "I came not to abolish [The Laws], but fulfill them." (Matthew 5:17)

Does this mean that the laws of the Old Testament are fulfilled, and therefore nullified? Or are they fulfilled, and should continue to be fulfilled?

In the story of the Good Samaritan, Jesus stressed how even devout Jews were passing by the suffering man so as to not become impure before going to the synagogue. This way, he makes it clear that we should not lose sight of the basic love of life that we should all have. To help each other. 

Now if he "fulfills" the Law, and this is what he expressed, that means that the law of ritual purity was not a priority when dealing with the basic goal of helping and loving thy neighbor. Now, if this law was passed by, which other ones are to be overlooked? We are not told the answer to this question and thus, many sects/denominations speculate which ones are the most important, and which are no longer relevant.</text>

    <text>I understand the significance of the argument about Jesus and the Old Testament Laws, which is why I try to keep in mind the rules provided in the New Testament, which was supposedly written for "Christians" while the OT was for Jews, that are also completely ignored.</text>

    <text>Paul talks about the old law in Galatians ALOT (specifically Galatians 3).  The old law pointed forward to the coming of the Messiah - and once He came, they were no longer needed.  They're helpful in getting the whole picture of God and insight to his teachings, but to say that the law is still binding is to ignore the new testament teachings.

Funny, you didn't mention sacrifices in your list of things Christians should do.

    <text>I didn't mention many of the atrocious things I'm glad Christians ignore, but there are so many. They just hadn't come to mind at the time.</text>
