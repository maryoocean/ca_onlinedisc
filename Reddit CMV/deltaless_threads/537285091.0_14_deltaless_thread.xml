    <title>CMV: Not all gay people are born that way.</title>
    <original_poster>eltonjohnelway</original_poster>
    <original_post>First of all, I should make it known that I am not anti-LGBT and I believe that everyone should have equal rights and be treated fairly. I am straight but I do have a few gay and lesbian friends, coworkers, and family members. 

The common belief nowadays is that gay people are "born this way" and I can't find myself to completely believe this. I want to, as I want to be fully supportive of my gay friends. However, I am under the belief that who we are as people is almost completely defined by how we are raised and the experiences we have as children and through our entire life. IE- "we are the sum total of our experiences". I think that this expands to sexuality. I don't think there is anything wrong with this or that it is some sort of a mistake if you end up being gay. However, I do believe there is some alternate timeline/universe/ course of events ( whatever you want to call it) where certain people end up with different sexualities. In my opinion, my life could have been drastically different and I could have ended up being gay, but my cousin could have ended up straight. 

I am not trying to offend here, and I hope that it doesn't come off that way. I would truly like to have my view changed. Thank you!</original_post>

    <text>The thing about this is that people who despise  the LGBT people like myself (I'm gay) is that they listen only to their ego and opinions, they don't listen to what we feel or experience, because to them it's irrelevant what we feel, which classifies them beyond ignorant, I'm not referencing to you in any way, but there are opinionated people like yourself that have much worse ideologies that are baseless/without proof.

I don't know why I'm Gay, I just know that I definitely didn't at some point decide that like "Girls? Nope.". It's hard to pinpoint exactly when I realised it, I experienced attraction to boys when I was about 5-6 or so, I had no idea what it meant of course or that it was viewed as something negative, only had the idea that it meant I was gay at around 11-12. Only accepted it around 15, because we struggle to deny it for a while... so it's not like we want it either, it's just how we are.

I'm studying medical biothecnology, so I understand genetics very well. There is no such thing as a gay gene, sexuality is far too complex for a single gene. We have no idea what happens genetically yet, but we are sure that it is at least partially, if not fully, genetic, as an example when a twin is gay the probability of the other twin being gay is much much higher statistically or that it exist in other non-human species and for scientists it's a major red flag that genetics plays a role. There is also a field called epigenetics, it studies the affect of external stimuli to gene expression, it's a relatively new field but as an example, there are certain animals that change the color of their fur in the winter as a response to stimuli (like colder temperatures). It's important to note however, that epigenetic expression can be temporary (like those animals) or permanent (happens most notably during pregnancy/shortly after birth). I'm not saying that's how sexuality is defined because we have no proof but it's possible, though we don't know, as of now, what kind of factors might contribute to it. We also know that sexual fluidity is more common in the mammalian order *Primates* like bonobos and gorillas (we also belong to this taxonomic group) compared to other taxonomic groups.

Medicine loves to classify things and put them into boxes, so in modern medicine homosexuality, bisexuality etc aren't classified as mental disorders for decades now, they didn't want to de-classify it at the time but there was just no proof it was a mental disorder/disease. Right now it's considered a normal variation of human sexuality, like observed in nature, do people care to know this? No. Their ignorant opinions matter more. I decided to mention this because a lot of people like to be stuck in time (mostly older people) and call it a "mental problem", sometimes not even maliciously.

If what you are saying was true, there must be something along the way of human development that made you straight, do you remember anything? Because no one does. Your sexuality won't shape itself from your personal experience, that's not what the our data tells us.</text>
