    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>To answer your question, no there’s not. You’re American.  That being said, I will tell you that I learned something like this long ago in Spanish class. Once I heard that, whenever I would visit a foreign country, I would always refer to myself as being from the United States in whatever language I was speaking (los estados unidos, etats unis , etc).  But I would never let anyone correct me about where I’m from. Especially anyone from England.</text>
