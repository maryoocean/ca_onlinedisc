    <title>CMV: Joe Biden is the only major 2020 Democrat candidate who will preserve capitalism.</title>
    <original_poster>ChronoPsyche</original_poster>
    <original_post>I personally believe that capitalism is the best economic system for creating the most amount of wealth for the most people. I do think that it has its flaws and should have government checks to prevent it from getting out of control, but I think overall, it is the best economic system there is. I am a moderate liberal and my concern is that Biden is the only candidate who will preserve this system. This is a concern of mine because I think he is a weak candidate and am worried that his age and lack of focus will not make him an ideal president. Sanders and Warren are both experienced as well, more passionate, more focused, and more driven than Biden, but I am worried that they will lead America in too much of a socialistic direction, especially Sanders. I have been warming up to Warren recently, and I really want to support her, but there are some proposals of hers that I just have trouble coming around to.

1.) The wealth tax

2.) 40% of corporate boards elected by employees

3.) Breaking up big tech companies

4.) Medicare-For-All

How can these proposals work within a capitalistic system, or can they not? Am I right in thinking that Joe Biden is the only one of the major candidates that will preserve capitalism? Note, I'm not asking for my view to be changed on capitalism itself. Let's leave the socialism vs capitalism debate for another time.</original_post>

you need not worry then. No prospective US presidential candidate wants to enact "Socialism";

A wealth tax is completely justifiable in the current system, you do have the estate tax, why shouldn't you be able to also have a tax for non estate property some person owns?

2) Would guarantee that there is representation of workers in boards, giving a voice not just to the shareholders, as is usual in many european systems. (where there are usually the union leaders as members of the board) 

3) didn't the US do this like 100 years back with the Oil monopoly? I don't see that there is any reason you couldn't do it. Whether you think that its a good idea is a very different question, but not in the scope of your CMV.

4) that is no economic but a humanitarian question. You can have people dying from disease in capitalistic or socialist countries (USA // Venezuela) and you can have people generally not dying/or being broke afterwards from disease in both those systems(Cuba // all of the EU) being able to affort people free medical care does not depend on the economic system. It does not inhibit anyone from earning money in that system, unless that was through exploiting sick people.

The general ability to make money in systems which have all of these things is not lost, rather it increases. 

Because: systems which have all paid for medical care usually have either free or semi free universities which enables employers to look for talent in a vastly improved pool of young people who aren't struggling to bootstrap themselves out of possible debt holes.

Systems which have these proposals in place (or some of them) generally fare better in overall happiness and wellbeing, leading to higher productivity (as you are more productive when you arent depressed), higher social mobility, allowing smart people from families without weath to permiate through society much more easily and thus enable people with ideas to use the freedom to make more money than if this was limited to the already wealthy individuals.

[and for economic Freedom](https://www.heritage.org/index/ranking)

the latter interestingly by the heritage foundation, a conservative US foundation, who will surely be wary of government spending and "socialism", still listing four european countries before the US. with some which have cooperate boards with employees or an all paid healthcare and being members of G7: Germany, UK

Any fear that these things would make the US socialists are nonsense. Rather they would make the US more attractive to foreigners and for americans themselves.</text>
