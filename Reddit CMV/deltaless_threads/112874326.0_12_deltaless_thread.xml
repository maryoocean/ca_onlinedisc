    <title>There is no such thing as a "waste of time" - CMV</title>
    <original_poster>MorganaLeFaye</original_poster>
    <original_post>I hear (and read) it all the time. 

"Video games are a waste of time." 

"Watching TV is a waste of time." 

"Reddit is a waste of time."

"Watching paint dry is a waste of time." 

OK, so I don't hear that last one too frequently, but it still applies. What qualifies one person to decide how other people should spend their time, or what activities are worth engaging in while others are not? 

It is totally possible to waste the time you have available (i.e. procrastination), **which is not what I am talking about.** However, in terms of leisure activities and personal time, I don't think there is such a thing as a "waste of time." 

**EDIT** - I should clarify that when I say "there is no such thing as a waste of time" what I mean to say is that no one can tell another person what a waste of time is, or that a general activity cannot be broadly condemned as a waste of time. 

Change my view.

    <text>It seems like what this thread comes down to, is the fact that you don't think that person A can tell person B that they're wasting their time because its person B's opinion whether its a waste or not. So this CMV is really just saying "people can't force other people to agree with their opinions." Which is obviously something we all agree with, since that's pretty much the definition of an "opinion." So this is kind of a non-issue.

tl;dr This thread is a waste of your time.</text>

    <text>I'd be interested to hear from people who have the opinion that a certain thing was a waste of time for people to do (like video games or watching TV) and why they think that. I know I have seen it a lot on reddit that certain things are a waste of time, and whenever I respond to that, I have never gotten a response. 

My view can be changed with a compelling argument about how time can be considered wasted from a general point of view. 

I haven't read all the responses yet, but I am trying to because I am keen to see what people have to say. </text>
