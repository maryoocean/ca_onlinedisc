    <title>I don't believe that women should have to mandatory join the draft. CMV</title>

    <original_post>I believe that men are better suited for fighting in the armed forces than women are. If America was ever in a situation and they used the draft the men should go to war and the women need to stay home and support the troops in other ways. Most women are too emotional for that sort of this and would think too much rather than react. 
Plus women get hormonal and might make poor decisions during certain times. Plus, they could potentially be a big distraction to the men on duty.
Women would obviously be able to still volunteer or enlist, but they should not be forced to join the draft.</original_post>

    <text>Do you believe it should be mandatory for men to join the draft? I agree that men are better suited for military life, but I also believe any nation who's constituents wouldn't volunteer to defend it deserves the fate it gets. If given the chance, I would transition all military forces to a strictly volunteer force.</text>
