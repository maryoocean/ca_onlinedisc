    <title>CMV: The recent Atlantic shootings was not an anti-Asian event.</title>
    <original_poster>MacV_writes</original_poster>
    <original_post>A white man shot six Asian women along with two others in Atlanta. The narrative that has been that this is directly caused by anti-Asian sentiment driven by racist white supremacists stoking bigotry against Asians. To solve this problem, America must truly commit to not being racist, to listen to those in the Asian community, and to teach young white men in particular the privilege they have as well as the deadly effects of toxic masculinity. 

However, there are details that do not fit the narrative. 

A. The shooter said that this was not racially motivated. 

B. The shooter killed a white woman and white man. 

C. While the shooter had shared a post critical of China https://twitter.com/yellokeith/status/1372202427584192513?s=09 it never rose beyond the national condemnation -- and the victims were Korean.

D. White nationalists in particular are well known for their love of Asian peoples and Asian culture, due to their valuation of ethnostates. 

E. Intentionally racist shootings usually come with racist manifestos, shamelessly racist worldviews, racist narratives about how white people are facing oppression. 

F. The #1 systemic discrimination Asian people face is from Progressives championing 'meritocracy is racist' and 'Asians are white-adjacent' inflammatory racial rhetoric, resulting in concrete discriminatory politics targeting Asian people specifically by their race. https://www.newsweek.com/asian-americans-emerging-strong-voice-against-critical-race-theory-opinion-1574503 

G. Criticism of China as a global, hegemonic, communist power is mainstream and not founded on race or xenophobia. 

It is my view Progressivism is a system which converts Trauma into capital. It seems as though these current narratives are forcing an anti-Asian narrative as a politically motivated strategy to appeal to build on this system. People like Trevor Noah believe killing six Asian people necessarily is a racist attack. But that strikes me as intentionally crude analysis. Isn't it racist for us to project all Asians onto China? Aren't we racistly manipulating the narrative when we selectively emphasize race to push politics, especially when said politics advocates for formally discriminating against Asians as "white-adjacent?"</original_post>

    <text>Dude. Him saying he wasn’t racially motivated means absolutely nothing.  He may not be conscience of it. He may not want to condemn himself more.  That just is not evidence.  Otherwise we’d have to believe all the people in jail that claim they’re innocent.  Their word doesn’t mean much.

There is this common misconception that these massage parlors are strictly Asian or largely Asian. This is untrue.  Whites people and other minorities are trafficked through parlors like the ones he shot.  Additionally white people and other minorities willingly choose to work in massage parlors.  It is largely due to racial stereotyping that we think it is primarily Asians. 

This murderer went out of his way to specifically target predominantly Asian parlors and had intentions of driving to Florida to shoot more predominantly Asian parlors.

This was a racially motivated choice.  There is no getting around it.  Yes people of other races also were shot.  Because they were in a parlor that was predominantly Asian which was the criteria he used to select his shooting locations.</text>
