    <title>CMV: "White trash" is an offensive slur, and should not be tolerated in society just as we do not tolerate other bigoted slurs.</title>
    <original_poster>JSmurfington</original_poster>
    <original_post>This has bothered me for a while. The term "white trash" or "trailer trash" fits all the criteria for being a slur which should not be widely acceptable for use. But I have heard the term dropped casually in conversation, and no one seems to treat it like the slur that it is.

It is a term that denigrates and stereotypes a group of people based on their race, appearance, and socioeconomic status. It is meant to be derogatory. This to me is the definition of a bigoted term.

I'm not arguing that the term has as much history behind it as other racial or bigoted slurs. But in our modern society, we should still abandon the term altogether.

    <text>It's like using the term "honkie".  Sure, it might be intended to be offensive, but here's the thing:  White folk don't care.</text>

    <text>It could also be that "white trash" and "cracker" just aren't very powerful insults. The words don't sound that awful however if you call someone a nigger then it sounds bad, as the word "nigger" just sounds very harsh. Even if someone didn't know what it means they'd still know it was bad just based on how the word sounds. </text>

    <text>No. That is not how language works. You associate words with things because that's how you learned them.</text>
