    <title>If I met a girl on the internet and struck up a relationship, I would make up an elaborate lie about how we met so people would believe we met 'offline'. CMV.</title>

    <original_post>I know there is less stigma about this sort of thing these days, but I still don't think I could say 'derrrr, we met online'.</original_post>

    <text>The places to meet online are just as good or bad as places in the real world.  Difference between meeting at a bar, or meeting in the grocery check out line.  Being high school sweethearts vs a stripper marrying a sugar daddy patron.   

One could find another on Craigslist, or outside a dungeon in an mmo.  Some have found each other through hobby sites, special interest groups, while others started cyber relationships in chat rooms.  

Where you find the person does reflect on the type of person you are.  Some people are just more comfortable with themselves.  I'm not ashamed of letting people know I met my SO online.  I met him in a game, out side of a dungeon.   Took three years of friendship before we met face to face.  To me, that's much better than picking up some guy at a bar.  </text>
