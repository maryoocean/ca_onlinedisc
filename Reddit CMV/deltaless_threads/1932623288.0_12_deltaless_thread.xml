    <title>CMV: Eating Meat is Morally Worse than Bestiality, and it isn't Close</title>
    <original_poster>SortWalk</original_poster>
    <original_post>It seems like any reason that bestiality is considered bad applies equally to eating meat. 

It harms the animal? Yeah, so does killing it, turns out. 

The animal didn't/can't consent to it? I've never spoken with a farm animal, but I can't imagine they're very enthusiastic about their predicament. 

It's unnatural? There's nothing natural about 96% of mammal biomass being farm animals, or much else about how we produce and consume meat these days really.

I don't think this is surprising either; murder is typically considered a worse crime than rape, it's unclear to me why a different moral standard should apply to animals.

Eating meat also has much more severe externalities, including:

* Significantly contributing to climate change
* Wasting land and resources by being much less efficient than just eating veggies; it takes 10 calories of feed to produce one of meat
* Horrific worker abuse, especially in meatpacking and adjacent industries

I realize these aren't necessarily intrinsic to eating meat and are more related to factory farming as a practice, but realistically it's how most meat is produced so seems fair to count it as part of the moral impact of eating meat. Besides, even if the meat is organic/ethical/fair trade/whatever, an animal was still killed and mutilated to produce it, so it seems weird to get that upset about someone sticking their dick in said animal instead. 

I don't fuck animals; I do eat meat. Go figure.</original_post>

    <text>Controversial take - physical distance. 

While physical distance theoretically ought not impact our moral decision making, it almost always does. 

Looking a homeless person in the eye and telling them no is a more difficult moral act than seeing a Facebook ad for charity and deciding to not donate. Similarly, watching our fellow countrymen die is a tragedy, but all too often people either don't care or even relish the deaths of people who live far away. The storm which wrecks your favorite bakery hurts far more than the landslide that kills thousands of people you never knew. 

If being physically removed from the situation de facto absolves people from guilt, then that goes a long way in explaining this situation. Bestiality is necessarily intimate, you aren't going to be able to do it froma distance. Whereas when you eat a hamburger, the animals death and slaughter was hundreds if not thousands of miles away.</text>
