    <title>CMV: I think atheism is the better path than religion, as it can cause less conflicts</title>
    <original_poster>theraiderofreddit</original_poster>
    <original_post>Today, the world is filled with conflicts between religious groups. People rush to defend their religion, and think of other's religion as inferior. People are fighting wars sorely on the basis of religion, and the recent Charlie Hebdo massacre was done on the grounds of religion.

I am here with an alternate proposal: That of no religion at all, aka atheism. Of course, I don't mean eradication of Religion. That would be impossible. I am just saying that a world without religion would be a world with less conflicts.

One may pose the argument that the institution of religion unites people under a single umbrella, but that ship has passed. There are too many sects, too many divisions too many views for this to be effective. If one is not driven by religion, there would be less chances of conflicts. I don't mean no conflicts at all. 

Conflicts are bound to happen, but religious conflicts are one of the major factors. So why not remove religion from the equation and unlock a more peaceful world?</original_post>

    <text>I believe in good. It is all we can believe in, as a species. Our lives are meaningless if we don't have that vague ticking hope, or knowledge, that there is good in our world. To some people this good comes in the form of Christ, others Muhammed, their loved ones, their leaders, Superman, Santa Claus or any number of the above. Anyone and anything can inspire people, can reassure them, can give them something good in the world. Atheism means you have to find that spark elsewhere in your life. Religion can be a comfort, something to have faith in, something to guide you and make you feel safe. It can give you rules and structure on how to live your life and be a powerful tool in living as a community. I do not follow a religion strongly and I do not care because in the end we all believe in the same thing. It just comes in different forms for different people.</text>
