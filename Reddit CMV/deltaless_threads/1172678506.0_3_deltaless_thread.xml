    <title>CMV: Human Life has no innate worth due to the Laws of Supply and Demand</title>

    <original_post>Please put the torches away and stick with me for just a moment; I'm not a monster, I swear!

&amp;amp;nbsp;

So first I'd like to define the difference between Human Life and a Human Being. My premise rests on defining the two separately. Let me assure you that I feel that a Human Being with a developed consciousness is irreplaceable. However, due to the recent surge in discussions on abortion, I've been hammering out the details on a premise I'd like to present here in an effort to determine any flaws in it: **Human Life has no innate value, as there are over 7 billion humans on this planet, and the Laws of Supply and Demand dictate that an unborn child therefore only holds subjective worth.**


I noticed that many people seem to innately assume that unborn children are a highly valuable commodity, which confuses me, as any of 2-4 billion women could essentially produce billions more embryos at any given time. While a specific embryo or fetus can absolutely hold subjective value to a person, which is why I support laws that punish the murder of a pregnant person as though it was a double homicide, I don't see the issue with a person choosing to rid themselves of an unwanted pregnancy; nothing of inherent or subjective value was lost. While I'm not a fan of abortions used as matter of convenience (I'd much prefer universal healthcare and a robust Sex Ed curriculum), I see an abortion as nothing more than a medical procedure with no morality involved any more than a kidney transplant is "moral."

    <text>Firstly, you're using "worth" from an economic frame and applying it to a more broadly human one.  E.G. when we say "life has worth" we don't generally mean _in a capitalist marketplace_.  You're casually switching these frames without addressing it.

Secondly, even if we want to narrow the discussion to the commodity value of a baby, you would _absolutely_ have to include willingness to sell in your supply-side analysis.  That we could theoretically produce more babies is true, but supply of babies is simply - in economics terms - not elastic.  Increased demand doesn't solve supply problems.</text>

    <text>I would argue the number of children waiting to be adopted absolutely back my claim up, actually. Supply seems to be FAR outstripping demand when it comes to "Children available to any willing (and able, of course) to take them."</text>

    <text>Children , but not newborns.

You want to also look at why we tend to resist commodification of children.  Its precisely because of their intrinsic "worth" that we keep away from a "free market for babies". I'd suggest reading Radin's "contested commodities".</text>
