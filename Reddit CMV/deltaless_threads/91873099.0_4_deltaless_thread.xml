    <title>"Large" dating age gaps between teenagers (for example, 3 years) is shallow, "slutty" and desperate, and I can't help looking down on people who take part in them. CMV</title>

    <original_post>I'm 18, I'm still part of the teenage dating world. 

My ex girlfriend met her ex boyfriend when she was 14, she started dating him when she turned 15. He was 18 years old. There was a constant weight on our relationship because of it. I thought the 3 year age gap was too much. When we argued I would call her horrible things like "slut" and "desperate". 

I have a friend who is 18, she's dating a 23 year old. I secretly think "slut" in my head too when I talk to her. 

Some of my friends who are 18 are dating 15 year olds. I have a 20 year old friend who's sleeping with a 16 year old.  I can't help of thinking of them as dirty, greasy, liars, users etc 

I know people can like or date whoever they want, and I shouldn't judge them for it. Age gaps when we get older mean nothing. But in our teenage years, 3+ year age gaps strike me as disgusting, immoral and just... "Wrong". I actually get visibly angry when I hear a friend I've known for years is sleeping with a 14 year old girl. 

If a 15 year old tried to sleep with me, I would laugh at them and tell them to beat it. I am not sexually attracted to anyone much younger than me. 

I know my view is sexist and fucked up.  I know that maybe it's because I'm just jealous because I never experienced these romances while growing up, or maybe I'm actually just an ephebophile and jealous of people getting what I want . I know it's possible I only have these thoughts because I'm a misogynist and have been (unsuccessfully) suppressing it. But please, try and explain it in a way that's respectful and not insulting. I'm trying to change my view for the better here and I don't think I handle hostility very well (I shut down) 

Thanks.  Oh and by the way I have a girlfriend and she 's close to my age. </original_post>

    <text>You're making a personal value judgement here, probably based on a small number of cases that you've seen in your own life experience.

I can't comment on your friends, or their qualities or motivations but I would encourage you to let them be - if you think they are incompatible with your life then move on and don't hang around them.

The amount of negative words/insults in your post suggests you are really seeking validation that they are bad people in some way - perhaps they have upset you in some other way and you are seeking to use their ages in relationships as an attack point?

People having sex isn't a bad thing. People having sex where age gaps exist also isn't a bad thing in itself - if both individuals know what they are doing and respect each other then where is the problem?

    <text>But isn't an 18 year old who know's what they're doing, sleeping with a 15 year old who doesn't, the kind of 'using' we don't want? Who's to say the younger partner is educated enough to make that decision? </text>

    <text>You're assuming a lot. I've known tons of 15 year olds far more mature than many 18 year olds. Also, chicks tend to mature faster than guys.</text>

    <text>It depends on the individuals - I've met girls in their early twenties who don't really know what they're doing. Also, at some level making harmless relationship mistakes is healthy - people normally date people and learn more about themselves and the world through it.

People can have unhealthy relationships or use other people at any age - 15/18 is nothing really and happens all the time. 

So it does really depend on the individuals - if you don't like the people in your life or the way they are behaving that is one thing - but a blanket rule that relationships with an age gap are bad (or good) isn't the right conclusion.</text>
