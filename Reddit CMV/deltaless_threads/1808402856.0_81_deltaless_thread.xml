    <title>CMV: Fredom of speech is far more important than a few people being offended</title>
    <original_poster>brbrWh0r3</original_poster>
    <original_post>Freedom of speech should be protected and kept, there shouldn't be people arrested for anti trans comments or insulting a soldier/soldiers, or for nazi jokes, or racist remarks or jokes.

Those should all be handled between people, if someone says stuff you dont like you handle it, simply block them or avoid them, theres a whole world you can be in and that persons in a very tiny part of it. 

It makes me nervous seeing people arrested and charged for saying things. It's only leading us to a place where we can be arrested for saying whatever the government doesnt like. And they shouldn't be in that much power to effect our communication with eachother. 

I live in scotland and dont feel I have freedom of speech anymore. 

(For the record I'm a white woman who's bi and have trans thoughts ig for those folks who say it never has been about me, it has sometimes, and in more ways than just those)

Edit: No it's not just anti trans people, Yes I believe crimes other than hate crimes involving speech should be illegal (threatening violence, doxing, defamation) but I also believe insults, jokes and bad takes or thoughts should not be.

Edit 2: Consequences for what is said like losing a job, getting insulted, losing friends ect is totally fine I just dont think the Government should be in charge of what can get you arrested in this sence.

Edit 3: I live in SCOTLAND in the UNITED KINGDOM or in BRITAIN depending what you say, I'm not american, im also not here advocating for my right to be a dick, im just saying the government arent the ones I want saying what I cant say, I mean twitter can destroy lives without them anyway.</original_post>

    <text>Obviously words can have effects, and sometimes the effect is trauma. The threat of trauma can intimidate marginalised people from speaking their mind, which you must see is antithetical to the whole point of free speech. The internet is awash with bullies and organised campaigns that exploit this then scream free speech (while grinning on the side of their face) when anyone attempts to create a space without a constant barrage of negativity, a space where more people can be heard. As a straight white male, it took me a lot of experience to grasp the scale of the chilling effect caused by comments that, to past me, seemed innocuous. Who cares if a bunch of dickheads are invalidating your identity? Intuitively free speech absolutism feels ideal but we have to weigh the real world effects on the problem we all want to solve. Allowing hate speech actually *hinders* a lot of people's freedom to express so it really does come down to whose expression you value more.</text>

    <text>I guess my argument for this would be, create those spaces where it isnt okay, kick people out if they do it, that's a social consequence. And there are tons of people from all walks of life who have powerful voices. I dont mind if twitter is banning people for stuff, or Netflix removes a comedians show ect ect. That's all totally fine to me and is a big deterrent for people anyway. I just dont like the police and governments involvement</text>
