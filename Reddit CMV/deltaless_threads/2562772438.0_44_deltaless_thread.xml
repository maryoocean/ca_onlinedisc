    <title>CMV: It is illogical to not believe in Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>LAMARR__44</original_poster>
    <original_post>Many people either believe in Hard Determinism or Compatibilism. I will argue that both are illogical.

Both argue that human actions are extensions of factors we do not have a choice over. Compatibilism seems to say we are still free but just redefines free will to the internal factors behind a decision, but the decision is still decided by a chain of events outside of our control.

My argument is a sort of wager argument. Either libertarian free will exists or it doesn’t. If it exists and we believe in it, we have made a free decision where we are right. If libertarian free will doesn’t exist, the decision to believe in libertarian free will was out of our control.

So either we have a choice and we can make the right choice, or we don’t have a choice and were determined to be wrong.

Thus it makes more sense to believe in libertarian free will since it’s potentially the only one where we have a chance to make a right choice, if determinism is true there is no choice, so there’s no value in being right.</original_post>

    <text>Do you have control of your breathing while dead asleep? How about your heart beat, or digestion while sleeping? Those are autonomic processes that you zero active control over most of the time. Your thoughts work the same way. Ideas, thoughts, preferences all arise unbidden from your unconsciousness with little to no active control on your part. A memory, piece of music, or connection just appears in your mind without you wanting to think about that. Studies have shown that even when making active decisions, your brain and subconscious make the decision for you before you are consciously aware that you have chosen. YOU aren't making decisions. Your brain is, just like it runs your guts without needing your sentient mind to do a thing. You have about as much control over your choices as you do over your kidneys.</text>

    <text>Yes I’ve seen that study, do you know that there’s another study that tested individuals on which organisation they wanted to donate to which was a more deliberate decision than pushing a button in the other study? And they found no buildup in brain activity before making the decision.</text>
