    <title>CMV: People forgo their right to complain if they never do anything about it</title>
    <original_poster>ooselfie</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have a few friends that complain about their life ALL the time. I hear things like:

"My job sucks, I'm miserable here"

"God school sucks, I'm studying something so uninteresting"

I think they have total control - it comes down to laziness, or perhaps they don't even really want anything to happen. It is so easy to put in some extra effort in your day to make things happen for yourself. They complain and complain but never do anything to change. It's like the boy who cried wolf. 

If you constantly complain, but do nothing to mend the problem, then you shouldn't be allowed to complain.

    <text>So if someone is paralyzed and the chair they’re stuck with is uncomfortable, they can’t complain about it?
I get the idea behind this opinion, we should always strive to improve our lives. But complaining *IS* one way to do something about it, it makes our problems with something public and if we complain to the right people, they might just be able to help.  </text>
