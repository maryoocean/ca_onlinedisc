    <title>CMV: Public transportation should run 24/7.</title>
    <original_poster>Keep-reefer-illegal</original_poster>
    <original_post>We live in a world that is no longer 9-5. Businesses stay open later, friends can reach us with a portable device simply by typing on a mini keyboard. It doesn't make sense that public transportation isn't 24/7. Here are some reasons why it should be 24/7:

1. Very few buses run at 2 am for last call, I feel like if nothing else, running buses later let's responsible drunk people take public transit instead of driving home. 

2. It would benefit the working poor who may work night shift 

3. As mentioned before our world is now 24/7 

Those are my arguments. 

I encourage you all to change my view 

Edit: by transit I am including trains, buses, all forms of public transportation, not just buses.

    <text>In what areas? I'm from a less populous city. Here, the city bus in my area does not run on Sundays. And on Saturday, it comes once an hour. If a twenty four hour system appeared, the bus would probably come once after midnight and then not again until 6 anyway because there literally would be no money to run it. Ridership during the day isn't very good, though I think if frequency increased it'd be more popular. Yes, it is not a major bus route, but I think you are failing to recognize that not every bus system is good.

Take the town beside me as well. Their bus costs $2 to ride and stops after 10 when the shops close. That's essentially the whole purpose of that bus. There is indeed a 24 hour grocery store on the route, but if you can't get to it between 6 and 10, well, too bad. You probably have a car.

Also, if this if just for the drunks, why not propose a special Friday or Saturday night line when most people do go out? Generally, people who work night shifts are able to catch some kind of bus. However, to force the taxpayer to pay more simply for drunks to ride could impose a serious risk to the driver.</text>
