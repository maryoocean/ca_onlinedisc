    <title>CMV: The onus of sustainability is excessively placed on consumers and the obligation should instead be placed on corporations.</title>
    <original_poster>Fluffy_Owl4316</original_poster>
    <original_post>Much of the media we read today about sustainability is focused on what consumers should be doing to move the needle. This includes things such as recycling food containers, composting food scraps, repairing and reusing clothing rather than purchasing new, etc. As corporations continue to produce these items, the proper disposal and thus environmental impact, is placed on the consumer. 

On the other hand, corporations are publishing lofty goals about recycled materials and reduced carbon footprint by 2050 or other far-off timeframes. Yet, there is little regulation to ensure that these goals are achieved. There isn’t a single governing body which is responsible for measuring the attainment of these statements, which doesn’t hinder the goodwill of creating the goals, but does little to hold corporations accountable for achieving them. 

At the end of the day, large corporations are responsible for much of the waste which harms the environment and should have a greater obligation and more enforcement of sustainable methods and materials. While end users are also responsible, humans fall victim to common errors and shortcomings which make true environmental impact, one that moves the needle, nearly impossible for individual users, even collectively as compared to large businesses. While the responsibility for sustainability and carbon footprint is often targeted towards consumers, the narrative should instead be on large corporations and how to hold them accountable to finding sustainable solutions.</original_post>

    <text>Thing is...it is always on the consumer in the end.

If you move the onus to the corporation then it becomes more expensive to make product-X.  They pass that cost along to the consumer.  Then, some other corporation decides to skip the more expensive sustainability part and produces a less expensive product. Consumers overwhelmingly buy the less expensive product.  The company that was green goes out of business.

The only way to make this work is for governments to enforce sustainability.  But, then, manufacturing goes to some country that is happy to have the jobs and does not do that.  Then you need your country to tax the hell out of them.  Then local politicians tell you how the current admin is making life expensive for you so they get voted in and allow the non-sustainable stuff in.

In short, you need to get people to willingly pay more for their stuff and, mostly, they won't do that which results in a race to the bottom.</text>
