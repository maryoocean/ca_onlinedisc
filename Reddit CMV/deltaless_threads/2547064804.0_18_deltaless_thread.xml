    <title>Cmv: Psychology is fucked up</title>

Any major psychological study done mostly has involved unethical and morally questionable expirements behind it. Sure many good expirements have been done without harming any organism but that doesn't cause leaps in this department of science.


Things such as fear, isolation etc have only been studied by torturing and abusing many animals and humans in the past. The breakthroughs made then make psychology research today seem slow and less conclusive.


Take for example, Harlow’s Pit of Despair or Stanford Prison Expirement or The Trolley Problem  or Milgrim's shocking obidence expirement.


Most will probably know these famous expirements because of their cruelty and discoveries unlike many good and positive expirements. 



It's ironical that the feild of study which needs to understand how the brain works needs a sacrifice of morals to progress quickly.</original_post>

    <text>I don’t get your examples of Trolley Problem and Milgram’s experiment. You do realize that there’s no actual people tied to tracks? And no one was shocked in Milgram’s experiment. What for subjects who had to “shock” others, I hardly believe doing bad things because an authority tells you is more inhumane than majority of our lives. Moreover, there was always a free option to say “no” and leave.</text>
