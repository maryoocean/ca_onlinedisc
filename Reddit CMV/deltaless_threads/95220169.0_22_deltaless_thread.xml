    <title>I believe that the 40-hour workweek is unnecessary on any level. CMV</title>

    <original_post>I believe that working 40 hours a week is entirely unnecessary for even (and perhaps especially for) technologically advanced first-world countries to thrive.  I feel that it isn't even possible for the majority of people to stay engaged for 8 or 9 hours a day, and that the 80/20 principle applies beautifully here (80 percent of work gets done during 20 percent of the time).

Our technological productivity has outpace our wants and needs to such a vast degree that it seems there are only to reasons justifying such a long work-week:

1-The economic machine needs people to be occupied so that they fall into the consumer mentality and fill up their few remaining hours with purchased items to entertain and fulfill themselves.  If people worked less, even if they were as productive, our economic growth would slow (which ecologically needs to happen, but I suppose can be seen as a negative).

2-Certain endeavors demand 40 hours or more a week.  Athletics, science, writing...but these are passion-based, rather than need-based.

I believe we could live happily in a world where everyone worked 20 hours each week.  CMV

edit: An awesome article that sums up my points much better than I can (thanks /u/WishingForBadThings)

    <text>Yeah but whenever I bring up this argument I get accused of being a lazy douche.  How do you defend against being a lazy douche?

Also, who does all the menial tasks that no-one wants to do?  Robots?  Immigrants?</text>

    <text>As far as a lazy douche goes: it's part of our culture that we hold work in such high regard, and compete as to who can (or at least can *seem* like they work the hardest. 

My response: a core value of mine is enjoying love and loving people and the world I'm in.  Not working?  I watch movies and go on walks with my family, rock climb, hike, camp, play disc golf, work on my French, play PÃ©tanque, learn to cook new things...the world's giant and exciting, and to say that "work" (WHATEVER your job is) is singularly more important than having a fulfilling and awe-inspiring experience on Earth is, in my opinion, wrong.

Menial jobs?  Fuck if I know.  We all do some? Robots?  We do them for awhile and then move on to "better" jobs?  I'm not purporting to solve all our problems...just saying that we could all work less.</text>
