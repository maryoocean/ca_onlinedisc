    <title>CMV: Colleges in the U.S. only care about profits and protecting profit generators in the middle of a pandemic</title>

    <original_post>Okay so, as I'm sure other sports fans have noticed, the NCAA has suspended all fall championships outside of division 1 and the Big Ten has officially opted out of the 2020 fall sports season.  Basically universities are recognizing that travel and the inevitable proximity to one another is unsafe and unpredictable.  So, to protect athletes that make them millions, they are preventing competition.  This is completely reasonable and is best practice for navigating the dangers to the health of student-athletes.  

However, they seem to take no issue with bringing in students from all across the country, and in some cases different countries, to live in highly close proximity on campus and go to massive lecture halls.  Why?  As some economists have noted, many universities without huge endowments may go bankrupt without tuition and room and board expenses being maintained by students.  So, they value their profit generators (student-athletes) and want to protect them, but health and safety is out the window if that means losing out on room and board (which would occur if the fall semester was declared online only) and tuition (many students refuse to pay the same price for an online tuition and are opting to take gap years if this is the case).   

It's certainly a financially tough situation for many schools, but should maintaining revenue truly be the driving force behind holding classes in person when big univeristies are signaling that they fully understand how unsafe travelling and being in close contact with people is at this point in the U.S.?  Further, by making this choice to have classes held in person, I believe the vast majority of universities have zero actual regard for the health and well-being of their students if it hurts their pockets.  Change my view?</original_post>

    <text>Well they’re kind of in a position where they are between a rock and a hard place. By continuing distance learning the argument will eventually be made that the students should be paying less in tuition. So that move will have to be made eventually, then let’s couple the loss of revenue due to room and board and finally revenue from sports. Even if the universities stay open they will have to make massive cuts to their budget by firing professors and staff to compensate, which further contributes to an already bad economy and massive unemployment, thus the only way to give the paying customers proper value is to have classes in person. Also these students can safeguard by social distancing and wearing masks which isn’t an option for athletes playing sports.</text>
