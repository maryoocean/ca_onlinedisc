    <title>CMV: Either every recognized genocide should be illegal to deny, or none of them should be.</title>

    <original_post>This IS NOT about whether some genocide took place or not, nor is it an argument about freedom of speech on the matter. This is simply about application of law.

A country should not pick and choose which horrible atrocity is illegal to deny and which ones aren't. Every act of genocide recognized as such by that nation's government should be illegal to deny or none of them should be. The law should be applied evenly to every genocide.

What sense does it make to decide which atrocities are illegal to deny and which aren't? It seems to be giving a message that "We recognize all these terrible crimes against humanity for what they are, but some of them are worthy of more protection than the others".

Making only select genocides illegal to deny just adds fuel to fires of conspiracy. Racists, nazis, bigots, all of the above, and so on, tend to see these laws as some sort of warped justification for their views; they believe they must be right because it's only illegal to deny the specific genocide that they are focused on and not others.</original_post>

    <text>I’m not a fan of these laws in general but  if you are going to have these laws I’d rather not have a blanket law. 

The reason why is not all genocides are equivalent. Some are nearly universally accepted and in no way can someone with a straight face argue that there were bad actors on both sides. For example the holocaust. Others are more complicated and started with tit for tat type things from both side until one side dominated. 

With regards to speech or debate clearly some are not so clear cut and if you are going to have laws restricting speech it needs to be only in the most extreme, nearly universally accepted cases of genocide.</text>
