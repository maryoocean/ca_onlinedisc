    <title>CMV: Hillary Clinton is unfit for presidency.</title>
    <original_poster>Professorjack88</original_poster>
    <original_post>I believe that Hillary Clinton is unfit for the presidency because she is corrupt, a liar, and a hypocrite.

1. Hillary Clinton is corrupt. She or her husband routinely [have taken money from companies](http://downtrend.com/robertgehl/oops-bill-clinton-says-he-accidentally-took-500000-from-algeria-during-key-arms-negotiation-with-state-department), that they then go on to give government contracts. [One of her largest donors was given a spot on the nuclear advisory board, with no experience at all.](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/clinton-had-donor-as-nuclear-security-adviser.html) She will not release her speech transcripts, which hints at the fact that Hillary may have told them something that she doesn't want to get out. Whether it be corruption or something else; she is hiding something.



2. Hillary Clinton is a hypocrite and a liar. She takes huge sums of cash from wall street, and then says that she is going to breakup the banks. She says that she is a women's rights activist, and yet takes millions from countries like Saudi Arabia. I haven't even mentioned Hillary's flip flopping on all sorts of her campaign issues, and described in [this](http://imgur.com/Ls3B6n1) image. You can see her whole platform change in response to Bernie Sanders. She seems to say anything to get elected.

Based on all this, how can people support her? The facts are right there, and yet Hillary continues to get many votes. Is there something that I'm missing? It seems as if the second she gets in office she will support the big donors that she has pledged against. Throughout this whole thing, I haven't yet talked about Hillary's email scandal. She held secret government files on a server that was *hacked multiple times.* If someone could show me the reasons to support Hillary that would be great.

    <text>I'm not sure about all of the comments here but:

1. Just because you vote for something doesn't mean it is what you believe in. In a vote you are likely to lose, there is little benefit in standing your ground and losing it anyways (besides parading around and telling the voters, ooh look at me, I'm that 1 out of 100 that voted against, and you are among the 99". You can use it as a political opportunity, you vote for something that you may not believe in and now someone owes you a favor. Running an organization as large as the government does not take a integrity as much as it takes wits.

2. Also many of the flaws you have said are things common among many of the presidents in the past. Yes, just because many others have done it does not make it okay for her to do it, IF the definition of "the office of president" included the fact that you have to be ___. However, this definition of not taking money, not being 'corrupt' (very loose as this is not true corruption, look at india or brazil), etc. does not apply to the office. It is time we change our view on what the president should be, and look at what they are. After so many imperfect candidates, it should be clear. </text>
