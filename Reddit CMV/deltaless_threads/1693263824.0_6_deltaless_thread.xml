    <title>cmv: Soccer would benefit from unlimited substitutions</title>
    <original_poster>cesarsalazar</original_poster>
    <original_post>Soccer (or football) only allows for 3 substitutions and once a player is out, s/he can’t return. 

In my view, this rule is counterproductive. Allowing unlimited substitutions (like in other major sports) would have all or some of the following benefits, without any major downside:

- Increased speed of the game (players would have a chance to rest from sprinting, etc)

- More creative/imaginative gameplay. Coaches can combine different players to achieve different tactics.

- Increased player career span. Players have a better chance to recover from injuries. Less incentive to play while injured.

- Higher play quality. Naturally the players that perform better spend more time on the field.

What am I missing?</original_post>

    <text>First imagine basketball with only 3 subs. And if you get subbed you can’t go back in. Basketball would be a very different sport. The game could become more strategic. Gameplay might slow down. Tactics would shift to conserve energy. It becomes a different looking game. Maybe better, maybe worse. 

Soccer is currently the most popular sport in the world. By a lot. Why do you think it needs to change and why do you think your changes would make it better.</text>
