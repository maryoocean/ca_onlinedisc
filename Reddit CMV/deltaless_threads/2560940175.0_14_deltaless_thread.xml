    <title>cmv: There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as an “American”</title>

    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>Aren't there some European countries with a history of imperialism? "The sun never sets on the British  flag." How about Spain?  Germans have never forgiven us for defeating them twice in their imperialistic efforts.  Screw.'m . We"re not the ones who burned  religious &amp; ethnic groups in ovens by the millions.</text>

    <text>Yeah, look up the scramble for africa for more info on how Europe completely fucking subjugated the places they colonised. Also the term imperialism comes from colonisation. India didn't even have independence until fucking 1950 lol</text>

    <text>Many Germans apparently want to believe that the ghastly events of the Holocaust are ancient history. I've seen several instances where, when challenged about their own national misdeeds, they've said, "Stop bringing that up! It was 80 years ago!" 80 years is just one human lifespan, barely a blink in human history. For perspective, I was born just 20 years later, and I'm not even all that old yet.</text>

    <text>The countries that get most pissed off about people from the US calling themselves Americans are the South American countries that actually have a greater percentage of their population from European colonization that the US does.</text>
