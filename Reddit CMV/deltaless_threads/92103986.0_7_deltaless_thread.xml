    <title>I believe the courting process should be eliminated entirely from sex, CMV.</title>

    <original_post>I don’t think that pursuing someone solely for the purpose of having sex with them, even if you don’t know them intimately, should be cause for judgment. Proposing sex to a friend, acquaintance, or stranger with no intentions of furthering an emotional connection or relationship should be acceptable. I believe our society has a strange and harmful dichotomy of attitudes towards sex - it saturates so much of our culture but is somewhat taboo on an interpersonal basis. I think that any limitations on sexual expression and release among consenting adults are harmful and cause unnecessary stress, and our society would benefit from fostering a more relaxed attitude towards sexual intimacy overall. 

tl;dr Casual sex should be acceptable and encouraged.</original_post>

    <text>There are risks associated with casual sex. These include STDs, pregnancy, or even rape. STDs can be lied about easily, as can birth control. A really obnoxious person might even use an intentionally faulty condom. These risks are relatively low, but I find that someone who's careless about their health where just a little more effort would prevent harm to be somewhat less respectable than people who take care of their bodies. 

I think casual sex with friends or decent acquaintances probably should not be looked down on, but with complete strangers opens up a lot of risks which could be alleviated significantly by just getting to know the person a bit better first. </text>
