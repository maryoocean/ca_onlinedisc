    <title>CMV: social media is ruining political debates/conversations</title>
    <original_poster>_Goldy82_</original_poster>
    <original_post>Social media is an outlet for a lot of people to talk, tell stories, share experiences and news, etc. 
The problem I have with social media and politics is the rumoring and free reign for many to twist details and frame stories to fit their viewpoints. I see some examples of this and will link to some when i find more. 
I am young (younger teen), so are my friends/people I follow. And for my age there are some really strong views on recent events that lean heavily one way or the other, and therefore i see only what this person feels is the absolute. 
The reason I say that debates are ruined by social media is because these stories that I see heavily lean in either direction and people become extremely biased to one side or another and it makes it hard for people to open up to the other side of the debate
The experiences I have on social could be much different than others and I would love to hear some opinions that change my mind on this matter.</original_post>

    <text>I donâ€™t think social media has ruined politics. I think the ever-present vitriol portrayed in social media is a symptom not the disease itself.</text>

    <text>The content is definitley more of an issue than the platform itself. And the people on it that use the content to show their ideas are also more of an issue. The social media is not the problem, its how people interact with it. In my opinion.</text>
