    <title>CMV: Customer service sucks</title>
    <original_poster>comeandgetsome30</original_poster>
    <original_post>I know this is a broad generalization, but holy hell, I remember a time when I'd walk up to a counter and not be met with someone who would just stare at me until I initiated interaction. I know life sucks, but geeze, try just a smidge to be kind to those who aren't actively f*cking you. The problem seems to be ubiquitous, whether on the phone or in person. People seem disenfranchised, and with good reason, however this negative attitude just spreads like a contagious bug. 

I know this is subjective. For those who are old enough to compare times, I wonder if there isn't anyone who doesn't share this opinion. For those who aren't, I feel pity if this is your normal.</original_post>

    <text>This is way too broad and unsubstantiated a view to effectively argue against. 

I have plenty of places I frequent because of their great, friendly customer service that keeps me coming back. Does that change your view?

Maybe try shopping at more small businesses. It's easier to care about customer service when the employee isn't working for a massive soulless conglomerate.</text>
