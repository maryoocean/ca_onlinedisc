    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>Religion cannot be FORCED, but nor should a child be prohibited from wearing a cross, hijab, yamulke, or any other religious garb. Forcing children to abstain from their religion is just as bad as forcing children to participate in a religion that isn't theirs. Jewish kids should be allowed to eat Kosher in the school cafeteria. Muslim kids should be allowed to pray in a private place at their scheduled prayer times. Christian kids should be able to wear cross necklaces. And atheist kids should be able to abstain from every religious practice. 

Societies were spirituality/relationship with God (or lack thereof) is not 100% ONLY A PERSONAL CHOICE are freaking medieval. We need to get beyond forcing everyone around us to practice religion or non-religion as we do.</text>
