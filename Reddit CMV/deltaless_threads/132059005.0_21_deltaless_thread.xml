    <title>CMV: I think masturbation is bad for you.</title>
    <original_poster>TextingWhileDriving</original_poster>
    <original_post>I used to be part of the /r/NoFap community and felt good about it. I had a sense of pride when a day passed without masturbation squeezed in there. However, I never went longer than 2 weeks without masturbating. Each time I masturbated I felt a sense of dread and depression, knowing I would just masturbate again sometime later. 

Today I broke my 4 day streak. I feel depressed and stressed. This basically confirms how I felt about masturbation in the beginning. It's bad for you. You could change my view with study's or from experience yourself. Go ahead and try changing my view. </original_post>

    <text>You have created an arbitrary goal for yourself. When you don't reach that goal you feel bad. It has absolutely nothing to do with the act.

People feel similar if they cheat on a diet. It's just not living up to what you said you would do.

If anything masturbation is medically good for you. Not the inverse.</text>
