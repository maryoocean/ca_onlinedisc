    <title>I believe creationism and/or Intelligent Design should be discussed alongside evolution in high school biology classes. CMV.</title>
    <original_poster>dyslexda</original_poster>
    <original_post>I am a Microbiology graduate student; I also am agnostic. I do not believe creationism or Intelligent Design have any scientific validity. That being said...

I believe that, unlike most on Reddit, creationism and/or Intelligent Design *should* be discussed in conjugation with teachings on evolution. There are two benefits derived from this:

1.) First, creationism provides the perfect foil for discussing what actually constitutes a good scientific theory. The common (and accurate) criticism of creationism is that it has no scientific validity. I believe we should expose students to it to lead them through discovering precisely *why* it has no scientific validity. Is it because there are no reproducible results? Is it because it, as a theory, cannot be disproven? Is it because it does not make testable predictions? Is it because of lack of peer reviewed literature? A combination of those, and more? Yes. As is, people love to extol the theory of evolution, but generally do a poor job explaining what *precisely* makes it a good theory. The best education is one that allows people to draw parallels to new concepts not learned; knowing evolution is a good theory does you nothing if you aren't able to make a similar critique of other theories.

2.) Second, knowledge of public discourse. Like it or not, it's a big issue in the public sphere. Exposing students to it in a controlled environment allows them to explore it, develop an understanding of the issue, and, as I mentioned above, discover what its severe flaws are. This also can serve to educate on how science must interface with the public. As scientists, we need to realize that, to best communicate with the public, we need to change from evidence based communication (assuming that all we have to do is present the facts and rely on others to arrive at the same conclusions) to story based communication. The debate over evolution is a perfect opportunity to explore how a message can become distorted from the scientific community to the public if not packaged correctly. 

tl;dr: Discussing creationism or ID alongside evolution, as long as the scientific merits (and lack thereof) of each theory or nontheory are clearly and unambiguously presented, offers an important foil for students to become better educated on what exactly a scientific theory is, as well as learning about the public debate in a controlled and unbiased environment.</original_post>

    <text>Creationism and Intelligent Design *should* be taught in school. But in **history** class along side Greek Mythology and Roman Mythology. Or in a politics course or something of that nature to deal with the public views on it. 

Not in the science class. It's not science. Period. </text>

    <text>Everybody is missing the point here; you're the most recent, so I'll respond to you.

The point is not to display it as science. The point is to display it as an example of something that is *not* science. When learning how to form a hypothesis, students are often shown faulty hypotheses; when learning how to keep a lab notebook they often are exposed to bad examples as what not to do; when learning about evolution they are often exposed to Larmarckian inheritance as a specific example of what doesn't drive specialization and adaptation (though, interestingly enough, we're starting to find small examples of Lamarckian inheritance, though that's a different topic). The list goes on. To effectively teach what makes *good* science, one should offer *bad* science as a display, and critique it.</text>

    <text>No, I didn't miss your point. I see exactly what you're saying. I just disagree. Should we also teach alchemy in chemistry class? Astrology in astronomy class? Just to contrast what *isn't* the correct way to do something? I don't think so. I think that to do what you want to do is a risky move because of the delicate nature of the subject. Not to mention the fact that many people today *still believe in Creationism*. 

There are perfectly valid places to teach about alchemy and astrology. In history class. </text>

    <text>You're using [false equivalence](http://www.skepticalraptor.com/logicalfallacy_files/False_Equivalence.html) here. Simply because one wouldn't teach astrology in astronomy (though I'd be surprised if it didn't even get a mention when discussing constellations) or alchemy in chemistry (though, well, it is often covered early on; you can't tell me you've never discussed the attempts for the mythical philosopher's stone and the legitimate science that came from it, or the original Earth/Air/Fire/Water paradigm?) does not mean creationism in biology is automatically invalidated. 

Back to the point. If your goal is to teach the cold facts without a larger context, then yes, creationism has no place. If your goal is to help someone learn *more* than just the cold facts, you have to introduce more subject material. The one thing nobody has yet done is demonstrated a better system of teaching what makes good science and bad science, especially in the context of biology. Give me a better, more applicable example of bad science that can be displayed as such and you'll get a CMV; until then, everybody is essentially just demanding science class teach nothing but cold facts with no larger context.</text>
