    <title>CMV: While the GME squeeze is a powerful display of retail trader’s power, there is no endgame that doesn’t result in them losing massive amount of money.</title>

    <original_post>The GameStop squeeze carried out by r/wsb and others demonstrated the power of retail traders and seems like a fair punishment on market makers and hedge funds that have taken advantage of the stock market for ages, but there is no way that it will end well for them. Sure, a lot of stock brokers have lost millions on shorts because retail traders refuse to sell and are still buying, but they can afford to do so because they have enormous amounts of cash to rest on and because GME is clearly overvalued. GME’s market cap is several times its revenue, and the only reason it is that high is because of the artificial demand created by internet communities. At some point, sellers are going to fold and GME is going to collapse, and everybody that purchased it when it was overvalued is going to lose massive amounts of money, while Wall Street short sellers laugh their way to the bank.</original_post>

    <text>Sorry, if a smaller shareholders sell right now, they will make a nice profit. But once larger shareholders or the rest of the smaller retail traders get the same idea, GME’s stock will plummet to its original value. Therefore the vast majority of shareholders will lose their money. If GME returns to pre squeeze value, they will lose about 20x what they put in, resulting in a net loss.</text>

    <text>people can sell on the way down to the original price, and there's a decent chance it ends up somewhat higher than that mid-long term.

It depends when they bought of course but especially if people who bought at 200 sell at 250 and people who bought at 60 sell for 70 etc most of them can come away with a profit</text>
