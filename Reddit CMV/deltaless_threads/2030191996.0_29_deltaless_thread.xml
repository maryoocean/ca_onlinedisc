    <title>CMV: It's fair to compare carnists (people who eat meat) to nazis.</title>
    <original_poster>Arkenhiem651</original_poster>
    <original_post>1) Carnists think that animals are inferior; Nazis think that jews are inferior
2) Carnists put animals in camps; Nazis put jews in camps
3) Both jews and animals attempt to escape
4) Both are/were normalized. Anyone who goes against these beliefs were/are suppressed and treated as illogical/emotionally driven
5) Both are unnecessary 
6) Both are/were driven long distances and murdered
7) emotional detachment from the victims
8) Both are sentient
Alex Hershaft a holocaust survivor also used this comparison along with other vegan holocaust survivors.
"We're focusing on the victims rather than the cancer of oppression itself",[8] and that "I noted with horror the striking similarities between what the Nazis did to my family and my people, and what we do to animals we raise for food: the branding or tattooing of serial numbers to identify victims, the use of cattle cars to transport victims to their death, the crowded housing of victims in wood crates, the arbitrary designation of who lives and who dies — the Christian lives, the Jew dies; the dog lives, the pig dies."[6

Also Alex Hershshaft looks extremely young considering he's 88 and survived concentration camps. That's irrelevant but I thought it interesting enough to mention considering he claims it's due to his vegan diet.

Edit: I know I say Jews but this also applies to other victims of the concentration camps such as Slavic peoples, gays and communists</original_post>

    <text>Your analogy relies on animal rights = human rights. Unfortunately there is no moral equivalence between animal rights and human rights. Very few people practice true moral equivalence where you can say that all animals are equal to humans (I'd go as far to say none).

Let's say you eat a plant based diet. Industrial farming practices result in inevitable animal death and deprive animals of their natural habitat with no rights to relocation. This is unavoidable  yet you still choose to consume the products sold to you. You argue its unavoidable, but that's simply not true. You make a compromise saying that I can accept that amount of death so that I can continue to live to the standard of living I am living at now. If you truly cared you'd start subsidence farming in a small plot solely for your own consumption. If you drive, you accept the slaughter of thousands of insects as you cross the motorway, the components of the electronics and mechanics of the devices you use are mined from the soil of the earth killing hundred of thousands of animals and insect and depriving them of an habitat. None of which are truly necessary to survive. The fact that you are posting on reddit shows you are implicit already in your decisions to treat animal lives less then human lives. Thus, you can't use the carnists are Nazis comparison unless you also accept you yourself are a Nazi for the exact same crimes.

Tldr: for your analogy to work, animal rights need to equal human rights. Existing in modern society inevitable comprises animal rights in ways which would be unacceptable for human rights.</text>
