    <title>CMV: I do not believe in any absolute morality.</title>
    <original_poster>CARTARS22</original_poster>
    <original_post>Probably in reaction to my rebellion to my Christian upbringing, I have a hard time accepting any objective morality. I understand Christian morality, but as a non-christian I recognize my moral feels as a neurological response trained by evolution and society. I don't believe in any connection between myself and those I "care" about. I believe that I (humanity) act on what will have positive effects on my feelings, and that is the only reason I help others. How can there be a morality that stands above my self-preservation.

    <text>Mathematics can't exist without axioms. The choice of axioms is not arbitrary. Not all sets of axioms are equally good. Similarly, certain ethical axioms have to be taken. This does not mean that ethics is arbitrary.

The best definition of ethics I have come across is that populations of ethical people will outperform populations of unethical people, when resources are equivalent. If you have a group of people who only do things that directly benefit themselves, they will be outperformed by a group of people who are willing to help each other. A nation which enslaves a large portion of its population will waste resources keeping the slaves from rebelling that could be spent on other things, and would lose the benefits of educating them and allowing them to act freely and help the economy, make scientific discoveries, and so on.</text>
