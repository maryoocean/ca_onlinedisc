    <title>I find that atheists are devoid of compassion for humanity. CMV</title>

    <original_post>When I was a Christian, I found there were assholes mostly but there also seemed to be a profound desire to do good. And when it did happen, it was so fucking relieving. 

I have been an agnostic for some time now. But I feel that people are not very compassionate. They are judgment and form emotional cliques. So their entire moral compass is based on protecting these loved ones and attacking those who 'step out of line?' On top of that, many atheists that I have met are often pretty petty about their ideas and, if something sounds slightly off or 'wrong', they try and shut you down immediately instead of listening. They seem to be completely legalistic.

Is there an humanist or atheist 'philosophy' out there that promote compassion for other people?</original_post>

    <text>I will admit that I tend to form emotional cliques. I think that's a natural human tendency - we bond with some people and not with others, and we have a much higher loyalty to and compassion to those we bond with.

And yet ... "attacking those who step out of line"? That doesn't seem to comport with my experience of my athiest/agnostic friends. 

Which means: while your mileage may vary, you should consider not judging the entire community by the actions of the parts of the community you interact with. :)
