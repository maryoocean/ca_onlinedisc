    <title>CMV: Focusing on ideological purity does not win elections</title>
    <original_poster>LaserWerewolf</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have encountered many people who openly say that they hate centrists more than they hate their actual political opponents. Fair enough, because ideologically they often have more in common with their opponents than with a genuine centrist, but when the election comes around the same people often ask why more centrists don't vote for their candidates. I don't know about you, but I think voting for people who hate me seems like a questionable idea. 

I have also noticed that in certain echo chambers (possibly this is a general feature of echo chambers) people are often insulted, verbally abused, or even excluded if they do not share every single belief common to the people in that echo chamber. Often this person then leaves and joins a different echo chamber where they are more welcome. 

Let's say that a person starts out in a Party A echo chamber. They agree with 9 out of 10 of the main Party A viewpoints. But because they disagree with Party A one one single viewpoint, they are pushed out of the echo chamber by people who demand ideological purity.

Now let's imagine that Party B says, "It is enough for us that you agree with us about this one viewpoint. We accept you." The person now joins a Party B echo chamber.

I think this person would most likely start agreeing with Party B more and with Party A less after switching to the Party B echo chamber. I also think this person would be less likely to vote for a Party A candidate and more likely to vote for a Party B candidate after switching to a Party B echo chamber. 

To change my view, you would have to persuade me that focusing on ideological purity causes a greater number of people to vote for one's party. Bonus points if you can back this up with some kind of statistical data, but a purely logical argument could also be convincing.

then they either don't vote or they vote for one of the two parties that hate them

That would make party B, not an echo chamber.

You are also acting as if both parties are complete echo chambers and are not coalitions of people with differing viewpoints. The simple fact is that the parties are not echo chambers no matter if someone on social media called you out.

You are talking about voters, they are obviously not monolitic in their views but have very few options. Now, politicians and their establishment parties need to become echo chambers or at least have a solidified viewpoint because the overwhelming majority of votes are done along party lines. 

There is less hate for centrist voters (because they can't be centrist in the booth, they literally have to choose) and more hate for centrist politicians who styme their parties goals. When you have Matt Gaetz or Joe Manchin throwing a wrench into a process that is on the verge of actually passing legislation there is going to be major backlash.</text>

    <text>Party B in and of itself may not be an echo chamber but may contain echo chambers.</text>
