    <title>CMV:Stalin was a bad leader</title>
    <original_poster>BRINGITSISTA</original_poster>
    <original_post>Hello! I have recently become a communist, or more specific a marxist leninist. But that is not what you will be changing today.

I hear many leftists and communists proclaim that Stalin was actually a really good leader and his negatives are exaggerated or fake....

Despite this, I still seem to have a somewhat negative view of Stalin

Yes, my image of Stalin has been improved by some communists I have encountered, but int quite there yet...

Instead of small one liners, I would like someone to write me a good, well rounded summary of why I should like Stalin

I know this might be controversial, so lets keep it to just communists and pro-Stalin people to answer this one...

    <text>A. How old are you? 
B. Stalin was one of the most evil human beings to have ever existed. I'd hope that you wouldn't change your view.</text>

    <text>To add to this, OP, I hope you do CYV about being a Marxist. The horrible shit people are listing here is all a product of Marxism and Communism. Seriously, how many more people need to die before people start realizing that those are extraordinarily shitty ways to structure a society?</text>

    <text>You think so? I mean I could see how Fascism is, but Nazism? Care to extrapolate a little? </text>

    <text>It's wrong to compare because all three were examples of reprehensible totalitarianism. However, I would say that the sheer disregard for human life in the grand scheme of things (e.g Marxist interpretations of human progression towards a utopian system) edges the competition.

Just to reiterate, this is a point emphasising the threat posed by such ideas  to humanity as a whole, and not a mitigation of the atrocities perpetrated under national socialism. Speaking purely in the abstract, it is not a case of one being 'better,' as I don't think one could defend nazism. Instead based on the danger of the idea on the greatest number.</text>
