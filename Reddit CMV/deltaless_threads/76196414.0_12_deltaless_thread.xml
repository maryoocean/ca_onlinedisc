    <original_post>Every now and then, I see the odd post, "If the top 1% gave up their profits, we could cure world hunger" or something ridiculous like that. I dont know why people that have less expect people that have more to help them. Why should they? 

Edit: better example. 

Edit: my C got Ved, /u/amemut explained it in a very pragmatic manner that I could agree with. </original_post>

    <text>It seems a lot of people have a problem understanding the basic quality of life argument (no offence I have just written this to 3 or 4 people already).

If people that can't help themselves don't get help they must turn to a life of crime to survive and that would hurt a lot of innocent bystanders.</text>
