    <title>CMV: Premeditated 1st degree murder is never absolutely and objectively the wrong thing to do.</title>
    <original_poster>eobversion1</original_poster>
    <original_post>Murder being morally wrong is determined by a consensus of opinions of the electorate, supported by politicians and written into the constitution of every country. I would argue that differences in circumstance and moral relativism will never make it a black and white issue. It's easy to think of it that way and most people take it for granted. Even in cases of genocide there was conviction on the part of the perpetrator that it was somehow morally justified, you and I may viciously disagree with their stance and international criminal courts might put them to death because of it but to them and at that moment it was the right thing to do.

    <text>I think I can argue for that murder or "bodily harm" in any form is always inherently bad.

Kants categorical imperative says, that you should only treat other how you want to be treated.

I view as given that you do value your life the most out of anything. (that you possess) (maybe you value another persons love so that you are okay dying for that person, not dealing with this) 

Now from this premises I can follow that when you want others to value your life since its the most important thing for you, you should do so, too. So it must be - in every case - an inherently bad thing to kill someone. Just because you know that you wouldnt want others to do the same to you.</text>
