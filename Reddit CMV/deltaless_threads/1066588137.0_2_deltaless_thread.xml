    <title>CMV: Astrology is nonsensical.</title>
    <original_poster>GSGhostTrain</original_poster>
    <original_post>To head off some initial arguments, I want to be clear that I understand many, many people engage in astrology as a sort of fun "horoscope only" type of activity. That's fine, and I don't begrudge anyone that. However, having encountered some people who buy further into it, including star charts for significant others being required, or making decisions based on astrological positions, I have always struggled to understand this belief. 

To date, I have never heard an explanation of *why* the position of the stars and planets would have any bearing on mood, personality, behavior, or anything else beyond potentially the weather -- only what the supposed effects *are*. I would like to better understand what the supposed causal chain is between the positioning of the planets and verifiable outcomes.</original_post>

https://www.quora.com/How-do-zodiac-signs-affect-our-personality

tl;dr humans are made of combination of 5 elements, which affects the personality. Astral objects also have their own combination of elements. Their position when a person is born influence that person's elemental makeup, therefore influencing a person's personality.</text>

    <text>I never said it is. OP is asking for astrology's justification to astrology. I gave it.</text>

    <text>This is the exact point I was making, though. These aren't justifications, they are just claims. 

" Human also made of star dust or 5 basic element which is air, fire, water, earth, ether. so particular position of planet for example Mars is dominated by Fire element so it affects the person by its element and decide how can that person behave and how he develop his personality."

There's very clearly a missing step between the initial assertion and the stated outcome.</text>

    <text>you are asking an unanswerable question.

The example use magnets, but it applies to most things. The only reason you should think astrology is nonsensical is due to lack of evidence, NOT due to lack of complete understanding of "why does it work". otherwise it's going to lead to the false conclusion that "magnet is nonsensical"</text>

    <text>The justification is just more nonsense. So it counters nothing to OP's view.</text>
