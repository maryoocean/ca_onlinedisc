    <title>CMV: We need anti-bias training against age evaluation based on color</title>

    <original_post>Many animal species, including humans, have lighter fur/hair and skin as youngsters. Even the Nazis "saved" little blonde kids who later, to their dismay, turned brunette as they matured. Human adult males, unlike chimpanzees, have been shown to have a preference for younger female mates. This would mean that the joke/meme that blondes are sexier or more desirable, would just be a short cut for saying that men erroneously perceive blondes as younger, which was already their subconscious preference. (Unlike chimpanzees which prefer mature females who have already borne offspring.) In another vein, police often treat black girls as being older than their actual age and hold them to a higher standard than lighter girls. The police could be subconsciously equating dark fur/hair with maturity and misjudging human age. I think we humans in general have a subconscious bias in equating lighter color with youth.  If this is the case I could see how subconscious anti- bias training would be useful for teachers, police, judges etc so children are held to an appropriate and equal developmental standards.</original_post>

    <text>Interesting actually. 

But the op might be using the term “we humans” to mean “we white humans”. 

But I don’t have the research to support that in the same way op hasn’t provided the research to prove his or her claims</text>
