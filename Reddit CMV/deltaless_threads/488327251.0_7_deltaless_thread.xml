    <title>CMV:I see no real reason to avoid resurrecting an extinct animal through cloning, and believe that fears of consequences are wildly overblown.</title>
    <original_poster>Runner_one</original_poster>
    <original_post>Jurassic Park, while a wildly entertaining movie, did a disservice to the public by planting irrational fears in the mind of the general public. 

While there is little chance of resurrecting a T-Rex or other dinosaur, we may be only a few years away from seeing a mammoth or saber-tooth walking the Earth again.  

Many people fear this and some are even actively working to prevent this from ever happening.

Some people argue that the introduction of foreign animals into an ecosystem would do much more damage than good. 

Less common but incredibly vocal are the people that see such experiments as an affront to God or Nature. 

Other people say that funds wasted on resurrecting an extinct animal could be better spent on conserving living animals.

I for one would be overjoyed to see news of living woolly mammoth walking the Earth again.  I also believe such an announcement would result in massive funding influx from private sources that could result even more scientific advances. These advances could have benefits for humans far beyond what we can imagine. 

A perfect example of such unforeseen advances are the many benefits brought about by the Space Race.  There are far too many to list here, but [Wikipedia lists perhaps over a hundred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_spinoff_technologies). I fully believe such spinoffs in biology would greatly benefit mankind.

    <text>“Some people argue that introducing an animal to a foreign ecosystem would do more harm than good”

You state this point but do not elaborate any further, despite it being a massively important point. 

Incredibly small changes can have drastic impacts on ecosystems. Many of which can cause chain reactions that are completely unpredictable, including the spread of disease, the extinction other species, the loss of keystone species, the spread of parasites, etc. All of which could have a direct and negative impact on humans. When an ecosystem suddenly changes, it takes a very long time to reestablish balance.

To illustrate how a small change can have drastic consequences, I encourage you to watch this video.

Another thing, ecosystems have built in mechanisms to maintain a certain balance, one of them being parasites (here, I consider a virus a parasite as well). When you remove a species from its native habitat and natural checks and balances, you have issues like invasive species. Invasive species can wipe out several other species through out-competing for resources, or introducing diseases and parasites that the native species has no immunity to.

Edit: I thought of one more point. Because the extinct animal likely has no immunity to common animal disease, it would likely contract, and possibly subsequently die from, diseases that are generally considered not problematic in animal communities. This could also lead to a zoonotic jump (from animal to human) and be disastrous.</text>

This seems to be a common argument. I had to choose someone to answer, lucky you.  I don't believe that the argument "We don't know" is a valid reason to stop any research, project, or advancement. Until we have an example of the effects of the reintroduction of an extinct species, we have nothing for a comparison.

    <text>In ecological science, it is absolutely a valid reason to not implement the mechanism, as it’s an ethical violation. That is exactly the reason we haven’t implemented gene drives in mosquitos to eliminate malaria outside of contained laboratories. </text>
