    <title>CMV: Dating is like finding a job, it isn't good to put all your eggs in one basket.</title>
    <original_poster>nerdywiththeword</original_poster>
    <original_post>To start off, dating is pretty like the job interview in a relationship. you guys are conversing to see if there is a potential fit for each other. If it is successful then there is going to be an offer for a relationship; if not then either the two is going to be friends or merely walk away and say goodbye without staying in contact.

Like job hunting, one should always be vigilant. When it comes to finding a relationship, one should focus on scheduling as many dates as possible to maximize their chances of being in a relationship. It is not wise to only stick to focusing all your attention onto one person because there is a big chance it wouldn't work out. Instead by talking to as many people as possible you are spreading your eggs in multiple basket and improving your chances at beating the numbers game.

This resonates well with job hunters since doing so many interviews (Or in this case talking to many potential people) will give you more opportunities to improve and sell yourself better down the road. I remember doing like 10 interviews before getting my first job. Each interview I improve upon one another and I feel this could be applied to dating.

Another reason not to put all your eggs in one basket is to be better mentally prepared when the date doesn't workout. You have another person to look forward to meeting so you won't feel too down.

    <text>The thing for me with this is that it becomes a competition.

You're dating someone and it looks like it's going well but they're dating other people as well. Now it's not about how well you get on with the person but how well you can convince them you're the right person, making it about branding not quality. 

You find yourself with the perfect match and it looks like it could move on but wait, some other person played a social favour card or arranged a date on a day that would've been meaningful in your potential relationship. Now you've missed out because you didn't have a social favour in the bank and the meaningful day is missed.

All that aside, it's a total dick move meeting someone and pitting them against other people.</text>

    <text>You also have to think about the opportunity cost. You would waste too much time by going on a date with someone and then having it not work out.</text>
