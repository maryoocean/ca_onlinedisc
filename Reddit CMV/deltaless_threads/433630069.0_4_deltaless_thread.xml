    <title>CMV: I should be able to sell my organs</title>
    <original_poster>stupidrobots</original_poster>
    <original_post>In short I should receive adequate compensation during life for use of my organs after my death.  The goal of this is to provide a financial incentive to increase the supply (and thus reduce cost) of organs required for transplant.  The benefits I see are as follows:

1) it gives the poor and disadvantaged a way to make money and get on their feet without requiring higher education or years of experience, relieving debts.

2) The financial incentive gives people reason to donate organs who might otherwise not.  This increases supply and drives down cost, and reduces time on waiting lists.  

3) A profitable program of organ collection would allow advertising for agencies that do this service and write up contracts, increasing the visibility of the needs of people who require organ transplants.

4) The argument that this creates a black market for organs is silly.  If someone wanted to kill you and take your organs, laws against it won't really help because now we're talking about maniacs.  

Furthermore my organs are my property, and I get to say what happens to my property during my lifetime and at the time of my death.  To deny this is to deny that individuals have the right to their own bodies.

    <text>So you're saying you should get paid to become an organ donor (voluntarily giving up your organs after death)?

I'm an organ donor for free!  And millions of other people are doing the same thing for free.

Some countries have over 99.9% of their population signed up to be organ donors including Austria, France, and Hungary.  None of those countries pay people to become organ donors.  One way they achieve such a high rate is through opt-out organ donation instead of opt-in.

I'm just not sure who you think is actually going to buy your organs which have a pretty low chance of being usable and with so many others giving theirs away for free.</text>

    <text>Opt-out organ donation assumes your organs are not yours in the first place.  That's dangerously unethical and frankly disgusting, I don't care if it's common.

And sure people might not be paid a million dollars for their heart after they die, but maybe I can make a quick 500 bucks by singing a piece of paper.  Who are you to tell me I am not allowed to?</text>

    <text>If you don't want to give up your organs then just opt-out.

They've done studies that show that people often select the default organ donation.  Not because they don't care or don't notice it, but just the opposite: They care too much and freeze and end up selecting the default option because the suggested response is powerful in a situation where you freeze up.</text>

    <text>Let's say I'm an undocumented immigrant.  Or a john doe.  Or a homeless person without any identification on me.  How do I opt out?  This is the reverse of the "Just have a voter ID card" you are assuming everyone has easy access to all the documentation one would need to opt out and that is absolutely untrue.</text>

    <text>In France there is a website to sign up or you can leave a signed document with your next of kin or even just tell your family you don't want to donate your organs.

Sure, there is a possibility of someone having no access to any of that (no next of kin, no family, no internet access even through a library, and against organ donation), but the amount of lives saved seems well worth that pretty rare risk.</text>

    <text>Doesn't that exact problem exist for your proposal as well?</text>
