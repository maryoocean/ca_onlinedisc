    <title>CMV: Most people are not well read enough to reasonably advocate for political or economic change</title>

    <original_post>**Edit: "Well read" was a poor choice of words. I think "have done their due diligence" might be more accurate.**

I'm writing this because I want to be proven wrong, because people saying political things, especially as if obvious has started to annoy and anger me more. Especially if they're making fun of someone for their political views, even if I disagree with those views. I hate feeling angry, so hopefully writing my thoughts out will help.

In trying to figure out my own political views, I've come to realize that I can't reasonably hold the views I held, or any other views. I studied economics, mainly the school of thought that appealed to me. But then more and more I came to realize that I couldn't say if the Keynesian or post-keynesian or the Chicago school or MMT etc. were correct, and that even people who devote their lives to the study of economics struggle with the same thing. The same thing happened in philosophy, especially as I came to realize the importance of epistemology and ontology.

And you can't reasonably expect people to put in the effort and time that it takes to sort through these fields. And that there is still such debate among the experts that even if you become and expert, the truth will not be obvious. I've come to understand what Socrates meant when he said something like "I only know that I know nothing".

I've also come to believe that people hold the beliefs they do more for social reasons. Less for the truth of the beliefs, but more because their reaffirm their identity, and their social bonds.

I can't blame them for that, or for not spending thousands of hours sorting through political thought, philosophy and economics. But a part of me still believes that they haven't done their due diligence, and I get angry that they can affirm themselves and their beliefs, while I sit here uncertain, unable to succinctly articulate why, or how to get this across properly.</original_post>

    <text>Sometimes a political belief doesn't require ten years of postsecondary education.
People bothered by, say, police brutality. Or say people who are bothered by the fact that their town doesn't have enough benches in public spaces. Both these views could be held by the higher level of the mentally retarded.

Past that, I think the search for truth is important. It doesn't always mean you'll find the truth. 
But two people having an argument in good faith is a good thing.
And you mention how you realize there are five or six economic schools of thought fighting things out. And that's not a bad thing either. And you shouldn't feel pressured to stick to one orthodoxy.

When I knew nothing about politics I was a fairly conservative Republican. Then  I became a fairly liberal democrat. And then I realized that where I come down on issues isn't really related to one party. I'm pro abortion, pro death penalty, pro gun, in favor of higher taxes on the rich than we have now, in favor of charter schools, against afirmitive action. And I don't feel the need to make my views align with anything more than myself and what I decide after looking at an issue.</text>
