    <title>CMV: A rationing system not unlike what Britain had during WW2 would be beneficial for the US.</title>
    <original_poster>RedShocktrooper</original_poster>
    <original_post>In the aftermath of WW1 Britain looked at their rationing system during the war, and concluded that there was... lots of work that could be done. During WW2, they had a whole section of their government basically devoted to making sure that, damn the U-Boats and the Blitz, they were going to keep everyone fed. This also caused a bit of a dietary shift, but as a result of the rationing it should be noted that *food quality increased* and life expectancy (when it wasn't truncated by bombings and long-range rocket strikes) actually went up on average. Admittedly, this came a the price of making food not too terribly exciting (thus mock duck and mock chicken) which to be fair probably discouraged overeating.  


Given the current tendency for cheap food to also be incredibly fattening food, a shift to a rationing system that ensured everyone had access to fresh veggies and also limited the intake of any one person's would result in an upward trend in general US health. Though, since we're not in a "enemy nation flying bomber runs over our cities and sinking our transport ships" situation at the moment there is no need for it to be so stringent.</original_post>

    <text>There is one huge problem here.

We don't really know what food is good for you and want food is bad for you.  For years we though red meat was bad.  That it increased your risk of heart diseases.  but recent evidence as thrown that into question.  Eggs we've never been quite sure about.  Now it seems that "processed" foods are bad for you, but there is not clear definition of what "processed" means.

If you can solve that problem.  Then you should be aware of another tool we can use to influence habits.

The US currently spends a lot of money subsidies food production.  The reason for this, basically, is that we don't want to let competition from foreign farmers to put american farmers out of business because we don't want to be dependent on importing food.  Being able to produce our own food is a security issue.

Anyways, we don't subsidize all food evenly.  Meat is heavily subsidized and fresh produce, not so much.  So if we could determine that eating meat in excess was bad, then we don't need to ration meat, we just need to reallocate subsidizes.  If its better to get protein from beans, the subsidize bean farmers instead of cattle ranches.  This drives the price of meat up, and the price of other foods down.

You could also put a sin tax on certain types of food.  Drive the price up even more.</text>
