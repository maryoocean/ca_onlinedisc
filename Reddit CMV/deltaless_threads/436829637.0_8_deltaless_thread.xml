    <title>CMV: Accusations alone should not be printed by the media.</title>
    <original_poster>OGHuggles</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't care what percentage of them are true, innocent till proven guilty is a thing. The erosion of privacy and civil liberties is of great concern to me now and in the future. While I'm glad plenty of women that would have been ignored before aren't anymore, I don't think accusations should be straight up believed. I think they should be taken seriously, but they should not get media attention until a case is actually made. 

False accusations are a thing and lives have been ruined because of them. The most infamous case of this guilty before proven innocent going wrong, is the Duke Lacross case I'm sure most people have heard of.

Why should I not be concerned about this? Why is it ok to ruin people's lives based off of accusations alone?

    <text>First off, innocent until proven guilty only applies to the state.   It means the government can't treat you as guilty unless you are found guilty.  But non-governments can do as they will.

Secondly, the freedom of the press is it's own thing to consider as well.   The press can't say someone is guilty either, or risk getting sued, so they always say accused.   They even say accused when they show me the video of the person doing the thing.

Thirdly, it's not really okay that the press prints things based on one accusation.   And if your referring to the very public Wienstien (sp?) case, then it's not one accusation.  It's many.  It's very many.   At some point it the press is actually fulfilling it's raison d'etre by alerting women of very real risk.</text>
