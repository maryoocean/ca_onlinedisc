    <title>CMV: Customer service sucks</title>
    <original_poster>comeandgetsome30</original_poster>
    <original_post>I know this is a broad generalization, but holy hell, I remember a time when I'd walk up to a counter and not be met with someone who would just stare at me until I initiated interaction. I know life sucks, but geeze, try just a smidge to be kind to those who aren't actively f*cking you. The problem seems to be ubiquitous, whether on the phone or in person. People seem disenfranchised, and with good reason, however this negative attitude just spreads like a contagious bug. 

I know this is subjective. For those who are old enough to compare times, I wonder if there isn't anyone who doesn't share this opinion. For those who aren't, I feel pity if this is your normal.</original_post>

    <text>I said it in a glib way, but it's an honest question.  Like that old cliche, if you look around and can't find the asshole it's probably you.

I don't typically have a problem with my customer service interactions.  And I haven't noticed any particular change in the culture of customer service representatives over the course of the last 20 years that I've been shopping for myself.  So can you say for certain the problem is definitely entire workforces over multiple industries and not you?</text>
