    <title>CMV: It's fair to compare carnists (people who eat meat) to nazis.</title>
    <original_poster>Arkenhiem651</original_poster>
    <original_post>1) Carnists think that animals are inferior; Nazis think that jews are inferior
2) Carnists put animals in camps; Nazis put jews in camps
3) Both jews and animals attempt to escape
4) Both are/were normalized. Anyone who goes against these beliefs were/are suppressed and treated as illogical/emotionally driven
5) Both are unnecessary 
6) Both are/were driven long distances and murdered
7) emotional detachment from the victims
8) Both are sentient
Alex Hershaft a holocaust survivor also used this comparison along with other vegan holocaust survivors.
"We're focusing on the victims rather than the cancer of oppression itself",[8] and that "I noted with horror the striking similarities between what the Nazis did to my family and my people, and what we do to animals we raise for food: the branding or tattooing of serial numbers to identify victims, the use of cattle cars to transport victims to their death, the crowded housing of victims in wood crates, the arbitrary designation of who lives and who dies — the Christian lives, the Jew dies; the dog lives, the pig dies."[6

Also Alex Hershshaft looks extremely young considering he's 88 and survived concentration camps. That's irrelevant but I thought it interesting enough to mention considering he claims it's due to his vegan diet.

Edit: I know I say Jews but this also applies to other victims of the concentration camps such as Slavic peoples, gays and communists</original_post>

    <text>It's disgusting to compare them because they are not related situations at all. I totally understand the moral stance against eating meat, but this is completely excessive and a repulsive appeal to emotion in the worst way. 

If you are a principled vegetarian or vegan, you don't need to make this manipulative, disingenuous, and horrifically offensive display. You should be absolutely ashamed of yourself for this.</text>

    <text>You should be ashamed for eating meat. It hurts to realize that you are a shifty human, doesn't change that you are one</text>

    <text>Well, okay, but I'm not ashamed of it, and I won't be just because you are attempting to shock me into confronting the fact that eating meat has associated cruelties. I can't control that, but if I did, I would choose for meat to be harvested as humanely as possible and for meat production to be drastically reduced. Or perhaps just grown in vats.

I have a feeling you are not here to have your view changed in good faith and are just here to proselytize.</text>

    <text>However, to make an actual argument, you're intentionally overlooking the most crucial difference, which is that people eat meat to survive, to nourish themselves, to process and make use of agricultural byproducts that would otherwise be wasted, to express their culture, etc. I bet you have offensive and ridiculous opinions about overweight Americans or whatever, one horrible opinion at a time please.

Nazis committed genocide because they were hateful, puerile, paranoid, cowardly, cruel, and liars. They created myths out of archaic old legends and blamed their incompetence and brutality on Jews. They committed genocide because they were *fascists.*

Regardless of how you feel about how meat is made, and yes, it can be cruel and inhumane, yes it should be done a lot less, yes for most people it is unnecessary (for many it is though), and even when everything is done to limit the cruelty it is still the taking of life. Still, there is no comparison whatsoever to be made here because there was no actual meaningful utility to Nazi genocide, they did it because they were evil and they were all wired on meth chocolate and believed their state's own lies. The production of meat still has an undeniable utility.</text>

    <text>Exactly, the Nazis should have just eaten the Jews and everything would have been fine.</text>

    <text>My argument is so nonsensical that the only response you have to it is a crappy fallacy and to say it's nonsense. Sure, whatever you say.</text>

    <text>What's fallacious about using the exact same argument you used with animals with Jews as well? Eating animals is fine because it provides utility for us. Surely eating Jews is also fine on those same grounds then. You have not brought up any other factors.</text>
