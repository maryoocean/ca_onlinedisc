    <title>Women are the inferior gender. CMV</title>
    <original_poster>TyKillsTyGoT</original_poster>
    <original_post>This is an issue I have really struggled with since adolescence and would love to have my views changed. I'm sexist. No bones about it. I know that I should think women are equal and holding these views makes me less civilized, but I haven't been able to find any evidence that would change my mind. 

The smartest people are men. The strongest people are men. It seems like women are average while men can excel or fail spectacularly. Harvard president Larry Summers agrees that men are better suited for certain difficult tasks.

I really want to be able to look at women as people but whenever I see a pretty woman in a nice car, I automatically assume someone bought it for her. When I see a woman out shopping, I wonder what her spouse does to afford her these priveledges. 

The women in my life seem to support this hypothesis. I know some girls who are very smart, but they're not on the level of the smartest guys I know. I also know some girls who are very physically fit but once again they cant compare to the fit men I know and research agrees with both of these points. 

I want to get over this beleif because I feel like it is tainting all my interactions with women and as a result the view is being reinforced more and more each day. 

So please reddit, CMV.</original_post>

    <text>That cliche quote about judging fish on how well they climb trees comes into play. Your rules about what constitutes superiority are done on the basis of what men have an advantage in. They are not the rules of mankind.

Men are physically stronger. Men also show to be more adept at STEM fields, the layman's idea of intelligence.  Whether this is relevant to our species is questionable. It is merely a trait.

Women have been proven to be far better communicators, and are better at conflict resolution. Those traits are useless to someone who sees feminine fields as inferior, but they are very relevant in your community and office politics. Humans are social animals far more than they are engineers.  

The sexes are evenly matched. </text>
