    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>It isn’t all cops. That having been said, it is the vast majority of cops who will stand around and protect a bad cop while he’s abusing someone from citizens who would intervene to stop the abuse. Any good cop would step in and stop a bad cop from doing bad things, but every time we see bad cops doing bad things, we see other cops actively supporting the bad cop. Every one of them is also a bad cop.</text>

How would you know that? Wouldn't the cops have to be involved in a situation like that for you to know? But that's hard to prove because according to 44 million police to public surveys collected over a 9 year period, [98.4% of police do not use force](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/punf0211.pdf), or even *threaten* force.</text>
