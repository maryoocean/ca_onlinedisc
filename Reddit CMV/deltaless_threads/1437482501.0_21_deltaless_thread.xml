    <title>CMV: Kink and BDSM should not be at public pride events and should be kept for 18+ ones</title>
    <original_poster>akoudagawaismywaifu</original_poster>
    <original_post>To start, I am a lesbian. And I've been seeing recent controversy about this topic. 

Look, no denying that kink plays a big role in the creation of pride. It is a part of embracing sexuality and shouldn't be excluded from the community. 

However, it should not be at public pride parades. Pride should be for everyone of all ages. Many people say "stop catering to the straight capitalized ideal of what pride should be" and "pride isn't a party, it's a protest don't police us" and "children should go to disney if they want family friendly" This has nothing to do with straight rainbow capitalism. I figured out I was LGBT at age 11 and trust me if I saw a kink act in public I would be kind of disgusted. I'm still a minor now, and I'd be less disgusted but still. I know people say that it's up to you to bring your children to pride, but by making all pride events "wear whatever you want even if it's nothing" we are also kinda excluding minors from it. It's also non consensual to anyone who is exposed to such acts, because nobody wants to go to pride to see naked people right? The "think of the children" phrase holds true here. Young children and teens embracing their sexuality shouldn't be forced to see adult acts against their will. 

Again, no denying the role kink plays in the community, but it should be kept at 18+ events. There should definitely be a separate pride for people who just want to do leather and other kinks. That way, you can do whatever you want in a safe space where you know you won't offend others, and because people consented to come to an 18+ event, it's all good. 

That's just my personal opinion on it, but it seems to be the minority. I'd like to see how you guys think about this.

Edit: it appears after reading and responding to several comments, I don't really have a problem with kink, but more with public indecency. I don't care if you wear a collar or leather pants. But I'd rather not see things that could get you arrested or questioned for doing in public.</original_post>

    <text>Gay person here, I’m gonna have to call a load of bullshit on this one. Kids do not need to see this, if they are having trouble with their sexuality the internet is already there. Nowadays you can find pretty much the answer to everything on the internet. Personally, I do not believe seeing a pride parade would help them in their endeavors. Especially if they’re just discovering their sexuality. If they see some of the rather extreme participants I highly doubt they’d be encouraged. I sure as hell wouldn’t be if I were young and viewing such a thing. Overall, I definitely do not think parades help people as much as you are implying here.</text>

    <text>Feels pretty selfish as an adult to claim something for yourself when it could be a helpful evenr for young conflicted kids who might not come in real life contact with queer culture. Maybe you should use the internet instead. 

My point is that the extreme explicit sex should not be a part of mainstream Pride.</text>

    <text>I agree with the extreme parts, and frankly I was mainly referring to that. However, I was saying most kids nowadays would use the internet before going to a local pride parade, and if they saw some of the things that were going on in the extreme parts they’d be better off using the internet anyway.</text>

    <text> I don't think the internet can replace real life experiences entirely. Actually meeting people and seeing social acceptance has value, I believe. Pride should be for kids, because queer kids are the ones who need to know they're not alone and society will embrace them.</text>

    <text>Frankly, I don’t seem to have had all of the mental struggle everyone else seems to have had. When I was younger and I realized I was gay I really didn’t have much of a mental struggle. So, I may just be viewing this differently here but I’m going to have to disagree with some points. I do not believe everything has to be centered in parades and events, not everyone enjoys big social attractions. Good in theory, not always good in practice. I was not saying the internet can replace things, I was stating that the kids will be way more likely to use the internet to sate their curiosity than attend a pride event. If I had to guess, it’d be considered ‘lame’ by them.</text>

    <text>Oh I'm not talking about curiosity. I'm talking about social acceptance.</text>

    <text>Why is main stream queerness automatically associated with BDSM and kink? Like there’s nothing wrong with talking about this, but like why do you specifically need to expose this to children?

There’s more to pride than sexual exploration. Like sexual exploration is a super important conversation, but there is a time and a place.</text>

    <text>I don't know if you agree or disagree. I'm not saying that is mainstream queerness. I just think it's very selfish for adults to exclude kids who might need it the most.</text>

    <text>Um… there’s nothing wrong with having conversation about it. That doesn’t mean you have to openly parade that shit specifically around children. That’s fucking creepy.</text>

    <text>Then I don’t understand? I also don’t understand how these communities are associated with main stream queerness, what does that even mean?</text>

    <text>I never said that. I'm saying Pride should be mainstream. Kid friendly. Not for adult gimps. They can do their thing elsewhere. Queer kids should be able to attend Pride. It's more important for them.</text>
