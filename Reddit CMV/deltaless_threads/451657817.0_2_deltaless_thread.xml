    <title>CMV: Even when it is unintentional, it is morally repugnant for a man to hit on a woman and come off as creepy.</title>

    <original_post>I realize that it is difficult for some socially inept men to flirt, but this one has stuck with me for a while. As a man, I can’t claim to know what it feels like to be on the recieving end of creepy flirting, but I can do my best to understand the effect it has on my female friends. Many women are victims of sexual assault, and those who aren’t have a perfectly good reason to be afraid of becoming one. To me, intent isn’t really the problem here, as the effect of making someone uncomfortable is still there regardless of intent. In the worst case scenario, one could even trigger panic attacks or horrible flashbacks regardless of whether or not the one doing the flirting had any predatory intent. These things are obviously harmful and can lead to some pretty unfortunate avoidance behaviors for women just looking to have a good time. I realize however, that this makes me seriously judgmental of something a lot of guys can’t change. So reddit, what are your arguments against this? </original_post>

    <text>So here we have a moral system where intent does not matter and all that counts is the worst case scenario.

Do you really believe in that? Because that system would make pretty much any action you could possibly do morally wrong. There will always be some worst case butterfly effect scenario you didnt think of.

Is driving a car morally repugnant because you could kill someone? 

And what are these men supposed to do? Are you saying that no man on the planet is allowed to talk to women? The chance to be subjectively perceived as creepy is always there.</text>
