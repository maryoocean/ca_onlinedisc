    <title>In the Israel v. Palestine conflict, Israel is by far in the wrong and the US should cut ties with the country. CMV</title>

    <original_post>It seems all that I've seen about the conflict, is Israel either taking over Palestinian territory that isn't rightfully there's, imprisoning innocent Palestinian people, and making Palestine out to be the bad guys.

To me, it seems like all of the violence caused by Palestine is just an attempt to raise attention to their cause. I would necessarily agree with that, but their point is still valid.

    <text>I think we should start by pressuring them to make the same progressive changes that their cousins over here have brought to us. Did you know that gay marriage isn't legal in Israel? Homophobic. And their immigration laws are very restrictive compared to Western countries, and far from anything you'd call "multicultural." Racist.</text>
