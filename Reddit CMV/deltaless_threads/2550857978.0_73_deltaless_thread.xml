    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

I’m of the opinion that MOST cops aren’t bad, but the reality is that people have a tendency to form biases based on negative opinions, and you see this with minority groups.

IMHO, all the people who believe “ACAB” are also probably very biased against other groups and I don’t trust them.

FWIW, I’ve had several interactions with PD in my life, and 9.89/10 have been positive (but then again, I’m not out there trying to fuck up my freedom doing wild shit sooo)</text>
