    <title>CMV: if you live in a “traditionally Christian” nation you should use Merry Christmas as the default greeting/goodbye unless you’re asked not to.</title>
    <original_poster>physioworld</original_poster>
    <original_post>Basically I think of it similar to misgendering people. In that context use the pronouns of the gender they appear to present as (unless you already know the person’s wishes). If and when someone asks you to use an alternate set, you apologise and change going forward. 

The same should be done with Christmas- in my experience almost nobody has any genuine objection to being told merry Christmas, hell, I was discussing just today with a woman in a full hijab our favourite (largely secular) aspects of Christmas, all the while referring to things as “Christmas XYZ”. However if someone tells me they’d prefer happy holidays then I’ll just switch. Just like pronouns it literally makes no difference to me. 

You can change my view by showing me that knowingly using words that will make someone else feel less welcome or upset is not worth it compared to the potential loss I might feel at using a different term. Of course maybe you can come up with other arguments I’ve not thought of.

Edit: this only applies “at this time of year” say more or less the month of December.</original_post>

    <text>Consider the situation of a deeply religious non Christian person in an office setting. For the entire month of December everyone is walking around greeting each other in a private way that you are excluded from. 

Happy holidays is the more inclusive expression. Consider using “Christ be with you” in stead of say goodbye. It’s essentially the same idea.</text>

That is a very interesting scenario. For contextual purposes, may I know which part of the world are you talking about?

This is as I come from an ex-British colony in Southeast Asia and is technically not a "Christian" country as defined by the OP. For us, festive greetings are fine and not exclusive. For example, I don't feel excluded from greeting my fellow countrymen "[Hari Raya Puasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Fitr)" or "[Happy Deepavali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali)". Furthermore, for the non-Christians here, Christmas is highly commercialised and kind of secularised. It is merely a festive greeting, nothing more &amp;amp; nothing less, and some of its traditions (most notably, gift exchanges) have gone mainstream.

Therefore, I'm interested to learn more about your experiences, when you say that some people (I'm assuming that you know them) are offended or slighted by this greeting.</text>

    <text>I talking about any area where Christians are the majority. I’m by no means talking from personal experience, but in a hypothetical sense. I’m also not talking about the non Christian being offended, but excluded. They don’t even need to be upset that they are excluded. It still has a negative impact on the interactions between this group of people.</text>
