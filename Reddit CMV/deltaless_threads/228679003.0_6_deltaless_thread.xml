    <title>CMV: It should be illegal for the police in unmarked vehicles to pull people over for traffic offences</title>
    <original_poster>joelzundel</original_poster>
    <original_post>**Argument 1**


Imagine two cop cars driving along a motorway in opposite directions. One of them is marked, while the other is not. 

The unmarked one is going with the flow, which is usually a couple km/h over the limit, pulling people over. They only pull over maybe 4 cars an hour, and everybody else is not slowing down, simply because they can't see the police. From a civilian standpoint this creates a paradigm: the police are there only to collect money for the government. 

On the other side of the motorway, the marked police car is driving normally, and obviously nobody is overtaking them. Everyone stays safe and happy.

IMO: The police should do it's best to keep people safe, not collect money.

**Argument 2**

Some jackass buys a used police car, some lights a siren, and a uniform off Ebay. Drives around in unpopulated areas, pulling people over and robbing them/killing them/whatever other crime. The victim can not refuse to pull over - it's a very serious offence in most countries. It wouldn't be such a problem if traffic police would only use marked cars.

    <text>The purpose of laws is to keep people safe. The purpose of the police is to enforce said laws. That includes traffic violations. 

It dos not matter if the car is marked or unmarked the police are the only ones allowed to have their type of light and siren. If someone is impersonating a police officer that is a crime. Arguing that the police should not operate in a specific manner because someone could be impersonating them is a very poor argument. 

The purpose of unmarked cars is for the use of catching people who only follow the law when they see that they are being watched which is very very dangerous. If people think they could be watched at all times they will behave more. Their second purpose is the use in surveillance during a stake out. </text>

I disagree, for these reasons:

Speeding, in and of itself, isn't a huge safety concern. It's things like quickly shifting lanes that causes people to have accidents. The safety concern in allowing anyone in a car to impersonate a police car (which having unmarked cruisers able to legally pull over a car for moving violations does) far outweighs the danger of people going faster than 55 mph on a highway.

I can see the utility in having an unmarked vehicle for stakeouts, but OP isn't advocating for unmarked cars to go away, just to say that they can't be used to pull people over for moving violations.</text>
