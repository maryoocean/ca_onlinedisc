    <title>CMV: Twitter will be transformed into a right-wing hellscape</title>
    <original_poster>newleafsauce</original_poster>
    <original_post>I fear Twitter will become yet another fringe, conspiracy-fuelled and bigoted platform like all the sites that don't moderate for misinformation or hate speech. User enjoyability will plummet and the loudest and most active sect will be those who ordinarily would be banned under the pre-Musk terms &amp;amp; conditions. 

Musk has expressed his intentions today to transform Twitter into a site that allows all free speech under the law. What does this mean? This means white supremacists, incels, misogynists, conspiracy theorists, science denialists, and anti-LGBT zealots, among other far-right groups will be able to promote the most repugnant content and disinformation, and grow their respective movements, which will inevitably spill over into the real world. They will be allowed to brigade and hate on any Twitter user who belongs to the identities they despise. And their victims can't do anything meaningful about it except to spend hours blocking harrasing accounts / DMs or to leave the platform entirely.  

The toxicity will get so bad that the  most socially-progressive people and people with non-fringe views will likely leave. Twitter will skew heavily right-wing and far-right fast under Musk. 

If you can say anything to alleviate my fears and predictions, I would be open to hearing it so I can have my mind changed on this.</original_post>

    <text>I'm curious to see what he does with twitter, I hope he opens it right up and exposes it all... I hope.  
I hate using FB and twitter...  
I'm not sure the hate on for elon. Media hype as he doesn't fit the typical billionaire profile? jealousy? that guy worked hard to where he is today. Not given stuff on a golden spoon.  
I think he did his time and wasn't handed much on a silver spoon from what I can see

Elon Musk was not born into wealth, unlike many fortunate businesspeople.  
He built himself up through his own innovations and determination.  
Although there have been rumors that Musk’s father was a wealthy, emerald mine-owning man, that isn’t true, and Musk has gained nothing from his father.  
Musk lived in tough conditions and the only thing that got him out was his passion for innovation through programming.
