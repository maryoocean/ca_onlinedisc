    <title>CMV: There can't be hatred without fear.</title>
    <original_poster>Alpy94</original_poster>
    <original_post>To be precise, I meant hatred of group or people. 

My argument is that hatred of a group is a direct result of fear of the group. An example would be with anti-Semitism. Nazis and modern anti-Semitic groups talked/talk about Jews controlling the world and money and the power, and how they are evil and make them suffer with their power. This is a clear cut example of fear. People felt threatened by the Jews. That fear lead to hatred.[ /* Cue in Yoda */](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnFr-DOPf8) 

I thought of any form of hatred and bigotry I could think of, and I couldn't find any where fear doesn't play an important role. 

So CMV

    <text>I hate children, and I could destroy any one of them. I might fear a large group of them (50 or so) at once though.</text>

    <text>Dude it's children. You should fear even one of them. A single one can ruin your life :P

    <text>I know you were joking around, but /u/threelite has a valid point.

I hate children, especially babies and toddlers, and do not fear them in the slightest. Also, I am sterile so I cannot have them so I am not afraid of having them.</text>

    <text>If you don't mind me asking, are you naturally sterile or through a procedure? </text>

    <text>Right, but that is beside the point in the CMV.

I do not fear children. I hate children. How does this not counter your view?</text>

    <text>why do you hate them?  is it just that you find their company unpleasant?  would you say that you'd prefer to avoid the company of children?</text>
