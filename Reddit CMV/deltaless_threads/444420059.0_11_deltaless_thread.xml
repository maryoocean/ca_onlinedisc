    <title>CMV: one day we will view people who eat meat as disgusting and immoral.</title>

    <original_post>Once, humans had very little regard for any living thing outside of their tribe. We were small nomadic groups who thought little of killing other humans simply to eliminate the risk that they might hypothetically pose to us.

Forming cities and later nation-states, our circle of empathy grew wider. Our tribe was able to grow larger thus our feelings of empathy grew to encompass anyone who was in the enlarged, new model of our old tribe. 

As we progressed and gained more knowledge and wisdom our morals changed with us. We gained empathy over time and our ideas about what was okay and what wasnt have changed rapidly. Not so long ago, it was considered okay to enslave, rape and otherwise brutalise another human, as long as they were outside of your tribes circle of empathy.

The basic things that made us understand that these other people were infact people were simple: they are capable of pain and suffering, and they dont deserve it any more than we do. They deserve freedom from persecution. A very recent example is gay and trans people, who we are currently bringing into the circle.

I believe that our circle of empathy will continue to grow and I believe that it is inevitable that animals will gain entrance to our circle of empathy. And that in many ways they already are. They are capable of suffering and they dont deserve it any more than slaves did 500 years ago.

If you ask people on the street whether or not an animal deserves to suffer, most will say no. But we still cause the suffering and premature deaths of tens of billions of animals every year in factory farms. 

I believe that in the near future, we will be viewed as savage beasts with no regard for what is right or wrong in account of this hypocrisy and implicit acceptance of evil acts.

**edit: im not talking about people who require meat to survive, im talking about you and me.**

    <text>The trouble with this line of reasoning is that when we speculate about what values people will hold in the future, we're like 19th century scientists wondering what 20th century phrenology will tell us about the human brain. Look at the common recurring Askreddit thread "what will people consider immoral in the future" and you'll see from the responses that the question may as well be "what do you find immoral now?"

On a long enough timeline, we're all monsters for reasons we may not even be able to anticipate. </text>

How is it hard to anticipate that we will be seen as monsters for enslaving, mistreating and slaughtering tens of billions of sensitive, sentient creatures every year?

Pigs have the same level of cognition as infant humans. The amount of animal suffering we actively support for the sake of eating cheeseburgers is objectively immense.</text>
