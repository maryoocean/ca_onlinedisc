    <title>CMV: I believe that abortion as a result of consensual sex (without contraception) is wrong.</title>
    <original_poster>BreakinMyBallz</original_poster>
    <original_post>I feel as though women who choose to have sex without the means of contraception, simply don't care if they get pregnant. They put their pleasures over the risk of having a child and having it terminated. 

I feel as though, when the sperm and egg mix, they create a completely new set of DNA, DNA that has never been the same in the entire history of our species and is a completely unique person (I'm not Theist, I try to base my arguments on the uniqueness of each person)

I don't see any way for someone to justify abortion when it is the result of sex without contraception. That woman simply did not care that new life was created within her, and chose to have sex in the first place. We argue it's a woman's choice for abortion? No, It's a woman's choice to have sex without the means of contraception.

-------
Clarification - I believe contraception is OK because new life with unique DNA and a unique person has not been formed and therefore will not be removed from the world.</original_post>

    <text>&amp;gt; I try to base my arguments on the uniqueness of each person

Why? Would it be permissible then to abort a single twin if such a thing were possible, or a clone perhaps? Does this mean in vitro fertilization is also wrong? 

What about tumors, they're genetically unique. What about individual cells in your body that have a random benign mutation, they're genetically unique. 

I guess my whole question is why does genetics matter at all? It seems like if that's really your criteria it's a really bad one that you should either refine or throw out completely in favor of some other criteria. When someone dies, I'm not sad that their genetic code is lost, I'm sad that a living, thinking person is no longer with us. It seems like whatever rubric we come up with to determine if it's okay to kill someone or not should use that sort of situation as a starting point, not genetics. Genetics just seems completely arbitrary. </text>

How is that related?  In vitro only performs the fertilization outside the womb.</text>

It's not quite 90% but yes.  This also happens with natural unprotected sex, about 13~17% of sexual intercourse can produce pregnancy.  Fertilized eggs are lost all the time.  
We are discussing a properly implanted fertilized egg in a uterus that by default will produce a person.  At least that for me is a life-giving process.  
The difference is that the *purpose* of in vitro is to initiate a healthy pregnancy, so it's actually going in the same direction, only through assisted means.  </text>

    <text>But the context is different.  The purpose of in vitro is to make an unsuccessful pregnancy process successful, and for that the option of destroying fertilized eggs is *necessary*, not optional, unless you freeze and even donate them.  
This is just a lab version of the same process of natural loss of fertilized eggs after sex. 

So yes, the in vitro destruction of fertilized eggs is accidental, meaning it's necessary for the process to be successful.</text>

    <text>Well I'm certainly not denying that it is necessary to have the process be most effective, but that doesn't make it any less an intentional act.  If someone thinks that abortion is murder, it basically looks like your argument is "yes, we had to kill a few kids, but it was so that we could make another one".  That's not going to convince someone, because most people don't think killing people is an acceptable side effect for a desired task.  They would just say you should not do that task if killing is necessary.</text>

    <text>This is essentially a straw man. You are comparing something that is intended to create life with something where life is destroyed out of negligence. Anyone can see why the two situations are distinct.

It would be easy for someone to view that the creation of a life as such a good that it allows for the "wrongness" of the death of the other eggs. Another perspective is that the killings are not done out of negligence which is a tenant of the original argument.

Or one can view that it is wrong. That doesn't contradict the original post, either.</text>

No, I'm comparing an act which takes life intentionally to an act which takes life intentionally.  I'm pointing out that someone who thinks it's murder is not going to be moved by pointing out that the 6 murders they perceive as happening will result in 1 new life.  Generally murder is not considered an acceptable price to pay for something.

&amp;gt; Another perspective is that the killings are not done out of negligence 

That would have the exact *opposite* effect.  Killing intentionally is always considered worse than killing out of "negligence".  Although it's not killing by negligence anyway...it's intentional in both cases.</text>

If you don't see the differences you are being deliberately dense. One of them takes life out of negligence and one of them takes and creates life on purpose. Usually it is done as a last resort because a couple cannot conceive. A better comparison would be someone who does IVF even though they can conceive naturally.

Tell me more about being deliberately dense while you're writing this right after I just explained that taking life on purpose is always considered *worse* than doing so out of negligence, and so has precisely the opposite effect of what you seem to wish if anything.

Murder in the philosophical sense of immoral killing?  That's the topic of this thread.  And like I said:

Well that's actually not what you said, as you can see in the quote, but regardless, granting that that's apparently what you meant, ok, so what?  That doesn't really change anything in my response.  It's still true that someone who thinks it is immoral is not going to be particularly moved by saying that killing 6 gave you 1.  Where else would someone accept reasoning like that?

    <text>I think you should learn more about the process before rejecting it on a knee jerk basis.  
In vitro assists the fertilization that happens in the fallopian tubes.  Normally the semen gets injected into the uterus and flows to the tubes fertilizing an egg.  On 80~90% of cases it doesn't work.  
In vitro extracts multiple eggs (10), selects the best of them (5) and fertilizes them under a microscope and then they watch them for a few days, usually 3 or 4 "catch on" successfully and only 1 or 2 are implanted into the uterus and hope one of them grows into a baby.  The rest are frozen and left as backup in case that fails in which case they also are implanted.  If the first rounds are succesful then they can be saved for another treatment, donated to some mother that can't produce eggs or simply discarded.  The number of fertilized eggs discarded proportionately to a natural sexual process is less.</text>

I suspect that not all the ones you froze you're going to end up using, which means they'll still be eventually discarded. 

&amp;gt; We are discussing a properly implanted fertilized egg in a uterus that by default will produce a person

We weren't though, we were discussing unique DNA. He never stipulated it needed to be implanted in a uterus, not that I see how that makes a difference. Why would it be okay to destroy an egg outside the womb but not immediately upon implantation? Why does that make it suddenly have value?

The question I'm trying to tease out here is "what gives a human life value?" I like my moral rules to be as grounded as possible with as few completely arbitrary decisions as we can - choosing some point of development like when the egg and sperm meet or when the egg implants is just chosen because it's a convenient line to draw, not because it's actually a significant moral event. If we're going to pick a spot, we have to justify *why*, which is a hard question.</text>

You suspect wrongly, all were implanted, and any worked they would have been donated.  I would request you stop speculating.  

&amp;gt; Why would it be okay to destroy an egg outside the womb but not immediately upon implantation? Why does that make it suddenly have value?  

The default outcome. Starting a process is a conscious decision you are responsible for.  Ending a process is a decision you are responsible for.  

Just like semen from a masturbation or an egg from menstruation are components to life, they won't by default yield a life.  A pregnancy process has a chance of doing so.  

I don't think the DNA argument is valid by itself, it's valid in that DNA represents the key of life, not life itself.  

&amp;gt; "what gives a human life value?"  

Common consensus.  

&amp;gt; If we're going to pick a spot, we have to justify why, which is a hard question.  

It definitely is, no denying that.  I hope scientific research can determine this more accurately.  Until now I draw an arbitrary line at the ~12 weeks of pregnancy.  Until then the chance of a miscarriage is so high that an abortion is just fiddling with the statistics.  After that it's way over 50% so I would consider abortion murder.  

I am happy to change this fuzzy line if you provide a better criteria.  Unfortunately I don't have (and I think few people can defend) a final answer to "what gives a human life value?" except *common consensus*.  At some points in history and in some geographies human lives are at the mercy of monarchies, institutions and other individuals, and the civilization process tends to increase the value of human life, so I extrapolate this to the future and think it should go in the direction that we should give human life great value.</text>

    <text>&amp;gt; The default outcome. 

So I'll raise the same question here: why is the default outcome important. This sounds suspiciously similar to the naturalistic fallacy.

&amp;gt; Common consensus.

This is a non-answer. What should that consensus be based on? How should the individuals coming up with their concept of what gives life value determine the answer to that question?

&amp;gt; I am happy to change this fuzzy line if you provide a better criteria. Unfortunately I don't have (and I think few people can defend) a final answer to "what gives a human life value?" 

My answer is posted elsewhere, but in a nutshell it's consciousness. This isn't a binary thing too. It's why it's more wrong to kill a dog than an ant - dogs have a higher level of brain activity. And likewise humans are more conscious and sentient than dogs, which is why if you had to choose to save either a dog or a human, the human is generally the right choice. This is also why it's morally permissible to take braindead people off life support - the spark that gives them consciousness is gone. The lights are on but no one is home. The part of them that makes them who they are and gives their life value is gone.

Humans don't develop the capacity for consciousness until approximately the third trimester, when there is a sufficiently developed nervous system. Brain activity can start to be detected and measured. Until then they are just cells that are dividing. Their value is only the sentimental value we attach to what they represent - there isn't any intrinsic value there.</text>
    </comment>
  <comment id="27168812506.0" user="beer_demon" delta="False">
    <text>&amp;gt; why is the default outcome important  

Because changing the default outcome involves a conscious decision, and that bring liability.  

Take a healthy man and woman.  By default they are not creating a person.  They *decide* to have unprotected sex and this ended up in pregnancy.  The default outcome changed from "no human life incoming" to "human life incoming".  To interrupt that also requires a conscious action and therefore liability.  

&amp;gt; What should that consensus be based on? How should the individuals coming up with their concept of what gives life value determine the answer to that question?  

Where did you get your principles from?  How do you know you are right?  

Common consensus is what shapes the rules of the society you live in.  Walking around with your penis out is wrong.  Lying to your SO is less wrong (although I find it a worser crime, but you can get away with it 100 times).  

&amp;gt; but in a nutshell it's consciousness  

Your criteria is as good (and fuzzy) as mine.  Mine is based on statistical chance of ending up in a human, so it's something we could apply today without error.  Yours it a lot deeper and significant, but we don't have a clear grasp of what consciousness is (brain function is but a part of it), so we can't determine if a fetus is conscious or not.  
However I don't disagree with you, I just find it a more complex criterion.  

&amp;gt; Their value is only the sentimental value we attach to what they represent - there isn't any intrinsic value there  

I disagree a bit there.  For the same reason common consensus is a strong reason for finding something right or wrong, I think sentimental value can be as important as intrinsic value.  Let's say you are told that the doctor botched your baby at birth but he also killed a mother in the other room, so he replaced your baby by hers and everyone should be happy.  The logic is perfect, genetics might be important but normally we can't really tell and the main behaviour will come from environment, education and love, however we both will agree this switch is unacceptable for "sentimental reasons"...</text>

What does liability have to do with value? 

&amp;gt; Where did you get your principles from? How do you know you are right?

My core principles are pretty axiomatic, I'll give you that. They're things like 'suffering is bad' and 'happiness and pleasure are good'. To that end, my moral system is that suffering should be minimized and happiness should be maximized. 

Unfeeling fetuses at early stages of development have no ability to be happy or suffer, so there is no moral holdup there. 

&amp;gt; Common consensus is what shapes the rules of the society you live in. 

But it doesn't make things moral or immoral, or give us any insight into whether our rules are good or useful. 

&amp;gt; Walking around with your penis out is wrong. Lying to your SO is less wrong (although I find it a worser crime, but you can get away with it 100 times).

These rules are not arbitrary though, and the consensus is not what makes them right or wrong. The wrongness of lying and flashing people can be derived from the desire to minimize suffering and harm

Well sure, but that doesn't do anything to establish the intrinsic value of the life. Someone who doesn't want a baby, who has no sentimental attachment to the fetus should still be allowed to abort. </text>

  <comment id="27169217843.0" user="beer_demon" delta="False">
    <text>&amp;gt; What does liability have to do with value?  

Indirectly.  
The pregnancy process means potential human life.  This is a percentage of the full value of the life of a human being.  It does not go from 0 to 100% at birth.  
I think human life is very valuable, so a low percentage of a high number is still a high number.  

By liability I mean that you consciously initiated the process that has a certain value, and I think ending it on a whim is not enough justification.  I do not rate an individual's comfort as more valuable than a low percentage of a human life.  At what point these values cross?  This might be arbitrary, maybe a fertilized egg is of negligible value and a 4 month fetus is of enough value to turn the tables fully, so we could narrow the discussion in between those parameters if we agree on the rest.  

The thing is, someone who has access and education enough to use contraception has little excuse later to say they don't want the pregnancy.  

&amp;gt; Unfeeling fetuses at early stages of development have no ability to be happy or suffer, so there is no moral holdup there.  

But the same could be said about a newborn baby, someone in a coma or just someone in deep sleep.  At that *moment* they have no ability to be happy or suffer, but they will after the situation is over.  A 4 month fetus will be able to suffer and be happy, and this promise has a value different to zero.  How much?  We can discuss.  

&amp;gt; But it doesn't make things moral or immoral, or give us any insight into whether our rules are good or useful.  

Agreed.  

&amp;gt; The wrongness of lying and flashing people can be derived from the desire to minimize suffering and harm  

In a culture where nudity is not offensive walking around with your penis out causes no damage.  

&amp;gt; Someone who doesn't want a baby, who has no sentimental attachment to the fetus should still be allowed to abort  

What gives them this power?  You can't do that to a newborn even if you have no sentimental attachment, why someone who is about to be born in 2 days?  Why does lack of sentimental attachment allow you to destroy something?</text>

Why?  If you take no further decisions you won't end up with a baby in your hands.  It requires sexual consent and a decision to not use contraception.  

&amp;gt; Can you explain why the human life isn't incoming moments before ejaculation but it is moments after?  

I did not say "ejaculation", there is contraception you can use the day after.  I don't have a problem with that.  

But let's concede that point for the sake of discussion.  Once there has been unprotected ejaculation (and no contraception ingested) then if you do not take any further decisions there is a chance a human life might be in progress.  This is not an outcome of conscious decisions being made.  
To interrupt this process I think you need a justification.  As you already decided to create the process just a whim isn't enough in my opinion.</text>

    <text>I know it's arbitrary and I am happy to have my mind changed.  The day after pill, like the copper coil or other IUD's, don't stop the fertilization of the egg but rather the implantation of the egg in the uterus.  To oppose the day after pill I'd also have to oppose the IUD's and I think that is not reasonable, they are proactive and safe forms of contraception.

    <text>Heh, no one's view is 'better' than anyone elses. This is a very complicated issue. I had something lined up but I was shocked to hear that you support the day after pill.

This may not be relevant now, but it sounded like you were basing your justification on the difference between action and inaction. I've heard two hypotheticals that muddy the waters a bit.

Imagine you are walking near a train track and you see a van stalled out on the track. Inside the van are two adults and two young children. There is a runaway train on a collision course and you know that all four people will die if the train hits them. You happen to be near a track switch lever, and by pulling the lever you can divert the train to an alternative set of tracks. However, on these alternate tracks is an old homeless guy who will not be able to get out of the way in time to avoid the train. 

Your choices are to pull the lever, an action that will kill a man that would otherwise be alive, or do not pull the lever, and let the four people in the van die. What do you do?

The purpose of this is to show that a person has responsibility over not only their actions, but also their inactions. Pulling the lever would kill a man, yes, but not pulling the lever would kill 4 people. Inaction is as much a conscious decision as action.


The second example is similar but I like it better than the train track one. Suppose you are participating in some sort of competition or contest, and you are a few hours away from facing your most bitter rival. You go to your favorite restaurant to get some lunch, and you notice your rival arrives shortly after you. You are surprised to overhear him order a dish that uses a peanut sauce because you know that he is allergic to peanuts. He won't die or anything, but he will be sick enough that he'll have to forfeit the competition. Do you say anything?

This example is less clear to me what is right or wrong, so I always include this alternative. Suppose your rival sees you at the restaurant and asks your opinion on what he should order. You suggest the dish with the peanut sauce. The outcome will be the same as before in that your rival will not participate, so is steering him towards a peanut dish really more wrong than preventing him from ordering it himself?

There isn't a right or wrong answer to these scenarios. Personally, I believe that inaction is an action. Choosing not to get an abortion is just as much a conscious decision as choosing to get one. There is no "if you don't make any decisions" because everything is a decision. Maybe it's something to think about at least.</text>

  <comment id="27169472888.0" user="beer_demon" delta="False">
    <text>Yes the scenarios you portray are more of a borderline situation, where deciding to not act has consequences comparable to an action.  Very interesting.  

But on both cases in a trial you'd be not guilty of murder nor intoxication out of inaction.  In the first case you might be guilty of murdering the homeless guy, because you had no way of knowing for sure the van wouldn't start up again or that anyone would die, and saving four lives doesn't make you immune to charges of murder of a fifth one.  

In the first case the layout was not designed by you but by an accident, and you can help or not.  I would hesitate to take action, I am not sure I would be happy with killing the homeless guy with my action, however the collision course and stalled van was not placed by me and I'd not feel guilty if I didn't force myself to act on time.  It would be different if I was the railway manager, traffic cop or van manufacturer, as I'd have some responsibility regarding the death of the family.  

In the second case it's more clear, I'd immediately act to prevent the intoxication.  I am very competitive and I want the competition to be true and beat him at our best.  By no means I would try to get him to have the peanut sauce if I could.  Watching my behaviour in competitions this is consistent with things I have done before (paragliding, cricket, japanese fencing, magic the gathering, etc. I have helped my rivals not make stupid mistakes)  

Am I weird?  Maybe.  I do think I back my positions well, but I don't expect my morality to be the right one.  

Now, how do we apply this to abortion?</text>

But if you had decided to go to a different restaurant, he'd be sick anyways. It's his responsibility to be aware of his allergies, not yours. Yet you still believe that your lack of action would be immoral in some way. I've never heard anyone who would let the kids die but also not let their rival get sick, but I don't know if that means it's weird.

To apply this to abortion, suppose a woman knows that she has a drug/alcohol problem and would be a terrible mother. And she knows that if she has the baby she won't be able to give him/her up for adoption because she'll fall in love with him. By having the baby, she's dooming him to a terrible life, and she likely won't be able to live with herself (suicide) if she creates such a harmful environment for someone she loves.

So now she has to choose, does she want to bring someone into the world and guarantee they have a shitty start to life, or does she want to get the abortion? As in our example, both action and inaction have undesirable consequences. In her opinion, choosing to not have the abortion will be more negative for everyone involved.

Is she making the right choice? Dunno. Maybe the people in the van would just drive off before the train got there. Maybe your rival will finish his lunch and then hire a guy to hit you in the kneecaps with a crowbar so he can win the competition. No one knows what the future will hold. But you have to make the decision you think is right with the information you have at the time. And if a woman decides that the act of abortion is better than the alternative of not aborting, I say let her do it.

Edit: For the train one, I usually ask a followup like "would you pull the lever if it was your mother/wife/child in the van? What if the homeless guy was an escaped death row inmate?" It's fun to try to decide where the line is.</text>

I wouldn't do it because it's my moral duty as a human being (nor responsibility), it's my moral duty as a competitor to try to win using the competition, not some external factor.  
If I did nothing and then won the competition I would feel worse than being second.  I've been there and I know.  

&amp;gt; I've never heard anyone who would let the kids die but also not let their rival get sick  

To me it works with "how would I feel less worse afterwards?".  

&amp;gt; a woman knows that she has a drug/alcohol problem and would be a terrible mother. And she knows that if she has the baby she won't be able to give him/her up for adoption because she'll fall in love with him  

I think dealing with the "falling in love with him" is easier and less bad than aborting the child.  She can have a contactless delivery.  

If you can prove that the woman is mentally unbalanced and pregnancy might cause suicide (something you are declaring as a fact) then of course I would go ahead with the abortion.  If you can also show there is no adoption institution within reasonable reach, no facility to provide a contactless delivery or no way of minimizing damage then maybe an early abortion is best, however in places like that the abortion processes are probably more dangerous than having the baby itself.  

&amp;gt; And if a woman decides that the act of abortion is better than the alternative of not aborting, I say let her do it.  

I agree, but wouldn't make it automatic to avoid abortions on a whim.  I would have her go to a court and explain her reasons before authorizing an abortion.  I gave you some conditions under which I think I'd allow it if it were in my hands.  

&amp;gt; your rival will finish his lunch and then hire a guy to hit you in the kneecaps with a crowbar so he can win the competition  

I'd look for a chance to get back at him.  Of course if I thought him capable of something like that my previous decision would change.  

&amp;gt; you have to make the decision you think is right with the information you have at the time  

Completely agree.  You can revert an unwanted pregnancy with adoption, but you can't revert an adoption, that's why the stakes are huge.  If technology allowed for donating or storing the pregnancy while it happens I guess it would be very different.  </text>

So it's not really about your moral duty as a competitor then? It's about getting what you want, which was a fair competition.

&amp;gt;To me it works with "how would I feel less worse afterwards?".

Hmm. I think I see where you are coming from though. Other people having abortions disturbs you, and you'd prefer the option that you personally find less disturbing no matter the consequences for mother or child. There are situations where it would disturb you even more to not let the mother get the abortion, which is when you'd allow it. But again, it's not about the mother or the child. It's about how the situation makes you feel. 

Is this correct?</text>

Yes.  I think "moral duty as a competitor" is the same as "wanting a fair competition", I wasn't talking about pure human altruism (although I would try to help out anyone when possible).  
In the case of a competitor, I have a reason NOT to help him, but I would rather do so.  I would never make this a legal requirement.  

&amp;gt; you personally find less disturbing no matter the consequences for mother or child  
&amp;gt; It's about how the situation makes you feel.  Is this correct?  

I think this is an unfair statement.  The first analogies you asked me what *I* would do in the scenario so I answered form what *I* consider I would do.  I would not criticize someone who would pull the lever or remain silent when able to help his rival, although in the latter case I would find it poor competitive spirit, a minor crime.  

Abortion is different because a) I am not a woman so I can't accurately claim what *I* would do if pregnant, and b) if my wife/daughter wanted an abortion I would oppose it but yield to their decision, even pay for it if needed.  What I would do is different to what I think is right for everyone because I can't put myself in everyone's shoes realistically nor impose my personal preferences on others.  

So, my point is about the rights of the incoming human life versus the rights of the mother having to carry it.  
Human life has high value.  A fetus has lower value (in the same way a newborn has lower value than an older human, but higher value than a fetus), but a low percentage of high value is still pretty considerable.  We have precedent of someone losing their rights when they made decisions that hurt others.  In the case of a pregnancy where the person had access to contraception and decided not to use it, and there is no health risk, I think in most cases that person should be able to complete the pregnancy and then give up the child for adoption and abortion on a whim is not an acceptable option.  

I see the human right to life as a continuum, with a sperm entering the egg at zero and a full adult ay 100.  You have to draw the line at some point.  I see that as value increases you have to make it more and more difficult to end this life.  You can kill an adult in self defense, for example, but you still get into trouble.  Ending a pregnancy at 8 months is not the same as 3 months and definitely not the same as discarding a fertilized egg from an in vitro treatment, although I would find fertilizing eggs and destroying them as a hobby something questionable at best.  

Did that clarify or confuse even more?

No.

Depends too much on the person and the situation.

&amp;gt;Does this mean in vitro fertilization is also wrong?

No.

&amp;gt;What about tumors, they're genetically unique.

Tumors are not people. The criteria is a genetically unique person.

&amp;gt;What about individual cells in your body that have a random benign mutation, they're genetically unique.

I fail to see why anything in the argument discussed "individual cells". He clearly states

&amp;gt;and is a completely unique person

This is clearly attacking a straw man.

---

&amp;gt;I guess my whole question is why does genetics matter at all?... Genetics just seems completely arbitrary.

It is arbitrary. A lot of things regarding the creation of human life is arbitrary. Why limit abortions to six/eight/ten/etc weeks? Because it is an arbitrary line drawn in the sand. This is where OP draws his land.

&amp;gt;It seems like if that's really your criteria it's a really bad one that you should either refine or throw out completely in favor of some other criteria.

The criteria is not meant to be some sort of rigorous logical rules. The OP isn't saying `if(unique_dna) ⇒ immoral` or `∀(unique_dna AND human AND ~contraception AND abortion), ∃(wrongness)`, he is simply saying that one should avoid the creation and then killing of unique persons with (ostensibly) some sort of natural rights. The word "wrong" doesn't mean anything other than "wrong". It doesn't mean it should be illegal, just that the avoidable creation and destruction of human life should be avoided if possible. 

&amp;gt; When someone dies, I'm not sad that their genetic code is lost

Because (usually) it was either unavoidable. People generally have some sort of opportunity to pass on their genetic code during their lives. An aborted life had no chance to express it's unique DNA because of an avoidable lack of responsibility from another person.

The argument that relies on a unique expression of a person is abstract. Someone like the OP can feel that "identical twin single-abortions" are wrong not because they have different genes but the genes will express themselves differently without any changes in genetic sequence (epigenetics). Or they can feel that it is ok even without losing their entire argument.

This entire debate rests on the question of how much value the life a fetus has. If it has literally zero, not figuratively but literally zero, then someone would be ok with abortion in all cases. If it has any value then someone can believe that abortion out of negligence is wrong. A fetus can have value for many different reasons and the unique expression of a human is one of these reasons.</text>

Those questions poke at the various edge cases of his stated position. You seem to be answering my questions with a different position in mind, so I'm not sure why you answered at all. If I was arguing with your position, I'd have asked different probing questions. If he wants to clarify his stance, he can do so. 

&amp;gt; It is arbitrary.

And that's bad, so lets fix it and come up with a better moral system. 

&amp;gt; The criteria is not meant to be some sort of rigorous logical rules

And this is kind of the point. His statement was pretty wishy washy. I want something more firm. I want to figure out what those rules are so we can apply them. We can figure out those rules if we can figure out what our values are, and I don't think he meant what he said, or at least he hasn't thought it all the way though. Once we start clarifying and examining why it is human life has value, we can determine what kinds of abortion are morally permissible and give strong reasons why, other than just that it's some arbitrary point we felt good about. Because that's a flimsy argument. 

&amp;gt; This entire debate rests on the question of how much value the life a fetus has. If it has literally zero, not figuratively but literally zero, then someone would be ok with abortion in all cases. 

Not true, because I think a fetus has literally zero value. It's not the fetus that has value, but what the fetus is in possession of: consciousness. But it doesn't attain that until about the third trimester when it's brain is developed enough. Until then it's literally just a lump of cells with the moral weight of a tumor.

This is why it's morally permissible to unplug people in permanent vegetative states - they're technically alive, but they's no more brain activity to speak of. The thing that gave that human life value is now gone. This is why it's less immoral to kill an ant than a dog, because a dog displays much higher level awareness, intelligence and capacity for understanding than an ant, which is little more than an automaton.</text>

Although the premise is weak the statement that negligence + abortion is wrong is not. I don't think it's possible to assign fixed rules to the definition of life and exactly which life is important and which isn't. I doubt that you think the fetus is completely unconscious until the third trimester where it immediately gains full consciousness.

&amp;gt;Not true, because I think a fetus has literally zero value.

If you assign value to consciousness than it is valid to state that a fetus has no value, but then you must also assign a smaller value to children than adults. In any standard definition of consciousness children are less conscious than adults but they are still valued equally (or children are valued more than adults). 

But other people believe that, rather than consciousness, the potential for consciousness is important and that killing something that is most likely going to develop into a conscious being (ie: human) is wrong. This approach gives the same value to children as adults but "overvalues" the fetus.

In OPs interpretation, which should not be limited to differences in genotype, importance is placed on the ability to develop a unique consciousness. The level of importance is non-zero or such that if a fetus is created through negligence it would be wrong to kill it.


&amp;gt;This is why it's morally permissible to unplug people in permanent vegetative states - they're technically alive, but they's no more brain activity to speak of.

I don't like analogies when it comes to topics like this because no situation accurately represents another. It's true that both of them have little to no brain activity but a fetus will (hopefully) develop this brain activity while a vegetative person will not.</text>

Of course not, but I don't think wrongness is a binary value either. 

&amp;gt; If you assign value to consciousness than it is valid to state that a fetus has no value, but then you must also assign a smaller value to children than adults.

Sure, if that was actually the case, but if there is a difference it's negligible at that level. 

&amp;gt; But other people believe that, rather than consciousness, the potential for consciousness is important and that killing something that is most likely going to develop into a conscious being (ie: human) is wrong.

I don't see how potential is ever a meaningful measure to use. Potential adults don't get to vote just because they'll grow up. We don't hand out rights based on what isn't there yet. Why should we?

And potential can go as far back as we want. You have to choose some completely arbitrary point and say "this is where we're drawing the line, for *reasons*", but the reasons never materialize. The line is drawn where it is because it's convenient, not because it's meaningful. 

The whole premise of gauging value on potential is just a variation of the naturalistic fallacy. *Why* should potential humans have value? What makes the potential have some kind of intrinsic value?

&amp;gt; I don't like analogies when it comes to topics like this because no situation accurately represents another. It's true that both of them have little to no brain activity but a fetus will (hopefully) develop this brain activity while a vegetative person will not.

That wasn't an analogy, it was a consequence of the moral system I laid out. </text>

Your full consciousness couldn't exist in a 2 year old child, but a huge proportion could.

Basically none of it could exist in a 3 month fetus.
