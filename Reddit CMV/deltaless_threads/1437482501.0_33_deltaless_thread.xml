    <title>CMV: Kink and BDSM should not be at public pride events and should be kept for 18+ ones</title>
    <original_poster>akoudagawaismywaifu</original_poster>
    <original_post>To start, I am a lesbian. And I've been seeing recent controversy about this topic. 

Look, no denying that kink plays a big role in the creation of pride. It is a part of embracing sexuality and shouldn't be excluded from the community. 

However, it should not be at public pride parades. Pride should be for everyone of all ages. Many people say "stop catering to the straight capitalized ideal of what pride should be" and "pride isn't a party, it's a protest don't police us" and "children should go to disney if they want family friendly" This has nothing to do with straight rainbow capitalism. I figured out I was LGBT at age 11 and trust me if I saw a kink act in public I would be kind of disgusted. I'm still a minor now, and I'd be less disgusted but still. I know people say that it's up to you to bring your children to pride, but by making all pride events "wear whatever you want even if it's nothing" we are also kinda excluding minors from it. It's also non consensual to anyone who is exposed to such acts, because nobody wants to go to pride to see naked people right? The "think of the children" phrase holds true here. Young children and teens embracing their sexuality shouldn't be forced to see adult acts against their will. 

Again, no denying the role kink plays in the community, but it should be kept at 18+ events. There should definitely be a separate pride for people who just want to do leather and other kinks. That way, you can do whatever you want in a safe space where you know you won't offend others, and because people consented to come to an 18+ event, it's all good. 

That's just my personal opinion on it, but it seems to be the minority. I'd like to see how you guys think about this.

Edit: it appears after reading and responding to several comments, I don't really have a problem with kink, but more with public indecency. I don't care if you wear a collar or leather pants. But I'd rather not see things that could get you arrested or questioned for doing in public.</original_post>

    <text>So this is discourse that comes up every year, especially from teenagers who have never attended a pride event in their life and have a tendency to be chronically online (Not saying this is you OP, just that I've seen this same argument for years on Twitter, Tumblr, Tiktok, etc)

It’s important to know what is actually being referred to when people say kink belongs at pride. They're talking about communities who have always been a part of pride, that have played important roles in queer history. They are not talking about people fucking in the middle of pride, or sexually harassing or assaulting people, or walking around naked shoving their genitals or the sex toys they’re currently using in people’s faces. Those kinds of things don't happen, especially not on an endemic scale, and no one is advocating for it to happen. Anyone who claims otherwise is either acting in bad faith or has no idea what they're talking about (like the aforementioned chronically online who have never actually attended a pride event). 

Not only does this show how quick people are to assume queer people are inherently sexual predators, but it also shows how little they know about kink and pride history. And something that is very forgotten in this “discourse” is that there isn’t one singular pride event. There are many, all over the place, and they’re all different. Some are family friendly, some are focused around kids/teens, some are alcohol free, some are kink inclusive or focused, some allow nudity/near nudity, some are 18+, some have alcohol, etc. Not every pride event is for everyone. People need to be doing the research to find out what a pride event is like and what it includes to make an informed decision about whether or not they’d be okay to go to it. And if it isn’t, they can then find one they can attend. 

It’s also worth noting that a lot of the arguments people are using are hypocritical, such as the claims about not wanting kids to see near nudity or anything sexually suggestive, but having no criticism of beaches or musical festivals or any general pda from non-queer people. It’s interesting how the claims of being sexually perverted are saved only for queer people. And a lot of the arguments are just recycled homophobia. Arguments like, “think of the children” and “I support you, I just don’t want to see it” and “keep it in the bedroom, I don’t need to know about your sex life” sound a little familiar, don’t they?

    <text>Yeah this makes me think of some documentary where they make a point about a gay male singer who kissed another guy during an awards show and when a news station had him on afterwards and played the video, the kiss was blurred out. But they showed the Christina Aguilera / Madonna kiss a minute earlier without any censorship. And the male singer was like “you guys literally just proved my point, somehow it’s only perverse when gay people show affection.” And this was relatively recently too.</text>

    <text>I've scrolled through the thread a few times and only seen a few discussions on nudity so it's difficult to respond without further context. Regardless, there's no widespread movement to support sex in public at pride or otherwise. There's always going to be a couple of weirdos/creeps and they should be criticised, but it's not representative of pride as a whole.</text>
