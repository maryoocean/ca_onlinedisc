    <title>CMV: While the GME squeeze is a powerful display of retail trader’s power, there is no endgame that doesn’t result in them losing massive amount of money.</title>

    <original_post>The GameStop squeeze carried out by r/wsb and others demonstrated the power of retail traders and seems like a fair punishment on market makers and hedge funds that have taken advantage of the stock market for ages, but there is no way that it will end well for them. Sure, a lot of stock brokers have lost millions on shorts because retail traders refuse to sell and are still buying, but they can afford to do so because they have enormous amounts of cash to rest on and because GME is clearly overvalued. GME’s market cap is several times its revenue, and the only reason it is that high is because of the artificial demand created by internet communities. At some point, sellers are going to fold and GME is going to collapse, and everybody that purchased it when it was overvalued is going to lose massive amounts of money, while Wall Street short sellers laugh their way to the bank.</original_post>

    <text>I think you're right on one thing, and wrong on another thing.

You're right that this is a game of musical chairs - there's no way that gamestop is worth $400+ a share long term, and whoever is the last to buy at those prices will get screwed over.

*That said* GME was already shorted at near 100% of its float at $5 a share. Even after a crash I don't imagine GME going back down that low ever again. Even if wall street short sellers try to hold long enough for it to get close to $5 at some point the interest is going to eclipse what they could stand to recover, and they will likely sell at a large loss (even selling at $7 a share would be a 40% loss). The people who shorted GME that low are pretty screwed no matter what at this point. People who shorted at the peak will do well, but that's only a fraction of the short sellers, I imagine everyone who shorted at under $20 - which is a huge number of people - will do poorly after all is said and done. 

Also consider that the upside/downside for shorting a stock is incredibly lopsided. Even someone who shorts at the peak stands to gain *at max* 100% of their initial investment. Someone who shorted at $5 and sells at $20 will have a 400% loss before you even consider interest. 

With all this in mind I would imagine that wall street short sellers are on average getting pretty screwed here. The people who shorted at the right time, likely the past ~week, might see in the range of an 80% gain - but the people who shorted too early will suffer massive losses on the order of 200-400% of their initial investment. 

And honestly, who knows if these numbers are even true. I probably would've written the exact same post two weeks ago when it ran up to $40/share, just with all these numbers scaled down by 1/4. It's really tough to say when this ends and at what price the early shorters will decide to cut their losses.</text>

    <text>What if you short it right now?

It's $193 currently. There's no way it stays above that price for very long right?</text>

    <text>If I've followed the logic right, that's where the importance of holding the stock comes into play. Shorts can't buy shares to cover their positions if nobody is selling, so they'll have to offer even higher prices to encourage more people to sell. That means even the people who short the stock now are also going to see their position go massively negative.

What isn't clear is if they'd be able to wait that process out. And trying to wait it out also costs money, because you have to pay interest on the shares you borrow. So the gamble is if you can afford to wait long enough to make the short position worth it.</text>

    <text>It’s honestly tough to say. 

I would agree with you, but honestly if you asked me the same question when it was $20 I would’ve said there’s no way it stays that high either.

When Tesla broke $100 I probably would’ve said the same there, and I’d be at a 800% loss.

A lot of things that seem obvious regarding stocks have been wrong recently. The only thing that sets a stock’s price is how much people are willing to pay for it - shorts are inherently risky and an easy way to get burned.</text>
