    <title>CMV: Fredom of speech is far more important than a few people being offended</title>
    <original_poster>brbrWh0r3</original_poster>
    <original_post>Freedom of speech should be protected and kept, there shouldn't be people arrested for anti trans comments or insulting a soldier/soldiers, or for nazi jokes, or racist remarks or jokes.

Those should all be handled between people, if someone says stuff you dont like you handle it, simply block them or avoid them, theres a whole world you can be in and that persons in a very tiny part of it. 

It makes me nervous seeing people arrested and charged for saying things. It's only leading us to a place where we can be arrested for saying whatever the government doesnt like. And they shouldn't be in that much power to effect our communication with eachother. 

I live in scotland and dont feel I have freedom of speech anymore. 

(For the record I'm a white woman who's bi and have trans thoughts ig for those folks who say it never has been about me, it has sometimes, and in more ways than just those)

Edit: No it's not just anti trans people, Yes I believe crimes other than hate crimes involving speech should be illegal (threatening violence, doxing, defamation) but I also believe insults, jokes and bad takes or thoughts should not be.

Edit 2: Consequences for what is said like losing a job, getting insulted, losing friends ect is totally fine I just dont think the Government should be in charge of what can get you arrested in this sence.

Edit 3: I live in SCOTLAND in the UNITED KINGDOM or in BRITAIN depending what you say, I'm not american, im also not here advocating for my right to be a dick, im just saying the government arent the ones I want saying what I cant say, I mean twitter can destroy lives without them anyway.</original_post>

    <text>I don’t think people should be arrested for speech but I do think we should fine people for hate speech without arrest. My reasoning is it’s easy to say just avoid it but when you have people targeting other in any category not just trans or lgbtq members but just humans in general. There are people that do hate others and would careless if people died but if you try to play their game and give them a taste of their own medicine people can get real defensive and you can say it doesn’t affect them but if it didn’t affect them they wouldn’t be so defensive. It’s really a war of mental health and who could try to put whoever deep in a depressive state of mind. I don’t think it’s right and safe to have us in a mental health crisis in are country. Because in the day of misinformation we can see how divided the country has gotten and this is a planned attack from foreign nations. If we would ever do get attacked and foreign soldiers stepped foot on our soil while we are in this divided state of mind we will easily fail and be taken over. It’s more than hurting someone feeling over a FB post and more like harassing other to the point where they would much rather take their own life. It’s not as easy as blocking someone when they are able to make a new account and easily type it out and send a message or target a certain business whether it’s a lgbtq ran business or a maga ran business. Idk just trying to state the obvious when people use the same excuses to why we should keep something rather than seeing what’s going on and ignoring it.</text>
