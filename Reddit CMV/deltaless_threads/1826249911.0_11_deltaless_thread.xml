    <title>CMV: The only form of government that exists is Opportunism</title>
    <original_poster>jerkularcirc</original_poster>
    <original_post>Everything else is just propaganda. History has proven time and time again that countries will always do/find a way to do what they think is in their best interest, quite irrespective of morality, laws, or even their own “constitution”. These labels of government and/or thinking one type of governing is always better than another is purely a result of propaganda and has been a great blinder throughout history. 

In group vs out group aka “us vs. them” thinking has been shown by research to be one of the best predictors of human thought and behavior and it has been utilized by those in power for much of human history to control the masses.</original_post>

    <text>You are right. In a sense. However certain systems afford certain opportunities. While it's true people are drive by opportunism, depending on the underlying framework someone else's opportunism might curtail yours. 

So basically yeah you are describing how people play games but that doesn't make all games the same just because people play to win</text>
