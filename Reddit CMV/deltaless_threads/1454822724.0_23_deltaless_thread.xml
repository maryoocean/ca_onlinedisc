    <title>CMV: There is no compelling reason for me to come out as bisexual to my close friends and family</title>
    <original_poster>LexVeritas</original_poster>
    <original_post>Happy Pride month, all! This is something I've been thinking about for a while and I would love your input. 

I am a cisgender male who is bisexual (probably Kinsey 1-2, significant preference for women) and heteroromantic. While I occasionally enjoy sex with men, I have no interest in emotional or physical intimacy or romance with them--I don't even like kissing guys, basically I'm just into cock. I also enjoy sex with women, and have a strong urge towards intimacy and romance with female partners.

I've come out or mentioned my bisexuality to some acquaintances, mainly random internet strangers and sexual partners of both genders. However, I haven't brought it up with any of my close friends or family members, for the following reasons.

First: my sex life is my business. I haven't told any of my close friends or family members that I like feet either; it's irrelevant to those relationships. 

Second: I have no interest in dating men or i.e. making out with them at bars, and therefore don't feel that being closeted is at all restrictive or oppressive. I will never need to vent about the way a man I'm dating treats me, or about a man I'm crushing on, etc. like I sometimes do with women. 

Third: If I did come out, it would require explanation of all of the above. I really don't feel any need ever to say the words "Hi mom, I'm bisexual but heteroromantic, that means I sometimes like to suck cock but I'm not going to bring any boyfriends home to meet you." I certainly will have this conversation with my eventual spouse because they will be a core part of my sex life, but I don't feel that discussing my sexual preferences with family and friends would be at all liberating or fulfilling. 

EDIT because I forgot to include it: Fourth: The LGBTQ+ "scene" doesn't appeal to me at all. I will happily wear a rainbow shirt and go to a parade and I have many friends of all persuasions, but I'm not interested in putting a rainbow flag at my house or habitually hanging out at gay bars (though I'd have no problem going to one if a group of friends wanted to, and have done so before). Equal rights, preventing discrimination, AIDS research, and safe sex are all important issues to me, but not more so than i.e. climate change, criminal justice reform, or funding education. If I came out, there would be at least implicit pressure to participate in the LGBTQ+ community; I don't consider this a core part of my identity and so don't feel any desire to do so. 

While I'm fully aware that coming out or not is my own choice and prerogative, I am curious to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks all.</original_post>

    <text>You obviously identify on some level with being bisexual because you're willing to use the term for it. I've met many guys like you (sexually into both, but more into women and not interested in building a relationship with men) who call themselves 'straight but bicurious', or 'mostly straight', or even just 
'straight', because they struggle to reconcile their attraction to men with the image they have of themselves as 'normal' guys.

So... If you identify with being bisexual, you've obviously reconciled with it, and you're on here asking people to talk you into coming out. So, does that mean some part of you *wants* to do it? 

As someone who's had to come out, it can be work, yeah, and you never come out just once. But it's a much different labor than having to stay in the closet is. The labor of staying in the closet always comes back to holding on to some sort of fear or shame, and it's exhausting. The need to hide yourself comes up so much more often than you'd think for something you'd keep so private. In the casually homophobic comments people around you make about gay men. When someone makes it clear that they see you in a very, very different way than you do, and you realize it's because they're seeing what you purposefully showed them. It comes up in the funny stories you have to change the details of to tell because they happened with a male partner. Or in your girlfriend's assumptions about what you like in bed and what you find attractive.

And coming out is hard, it's work, and you do it continuously throughout your life. But it's work towards a rejection of shame, and it's work you do when you decide that you shouldn't have to sanitize yourself for other people. It's not about opening up your private life for all to see, it's about deciding what you're going to keep private on *your* terms instead of external, heteronormative ones. 

And if it's still not worth it? Just don't do it. Or don't do it right now. If you choose to do it, it should be because it makes you better, not because you feel it's necessary on principal.</text>
