    <title>CMV: Average men do not have a good chance of having sex with women.</title>
    <original_poster>fitness35754745</original_poster>
    <original_post>My lady friends husband has had a threesome before and they are looking into being able to do it again.

This guy is 6 foot 3.

For me I'm only average sized. 5 foot 9 which an average penis of 5.5 inches length and 4.8 inches girth. My looks are also average only too I would say. However I would say my personality is good towards friends, I've managed to get my lady friend to open up to me about talking about her sexual experiences so I must be doing something right. (No flirting just friends talking, I'm lucky to have a friend like her)

I'm super insecure about this and this has kept me from sleeping. I'm not exsactly worried about having threesomes or often sex, I just feel quite inferior for not.

Do average guys really have a chance with this type of thing? I cant help but feel this guys height (and possible above average penis size) is making women consider sleeping with him more. Do I have atleast a good chance? I believe I dont and that I'm at a very big disadvantage. 

I know from fair studies that the preferred penis size is bigger than average and I'm sure the preferred height for a man is above average too. I'm more worried about penis size because well, it can change the plessure the women recieves no matter good or bad.</original_post>

Big penises just hurt unless you have a big vagina.

 

Seriously though, women are not typically thinking about penis size when they think about sexual viability.  Studies have shown that attraction of women to men is based on a variety of factors, none of which are directly related to your size. 

 

One of those factors is facial attractiveness rather than physical size, but women look for *parity* in facial attractiveness rather than trying to get someone “out of their league.”  So you don’t even have to have a really attractive face, you just have to be attractive enough.

 

Another interesting variable is kindness.  Women are actually very attracted to men who demonstrate kindness to others.  Kindness should really be its own reward, but apparently it can also get you laid.

 

Another factor to pay attention to is humor.  Interestingly enough, this is not just being able to make others laugh, but also laughing when *they* make a joke.  When humor is *reciprocated*, this can be very attractive.

 

To sum up, there are plenty of things you could be doing to get laid that have nothing to do with your height or your dick.  Hope this helps.      </text>
