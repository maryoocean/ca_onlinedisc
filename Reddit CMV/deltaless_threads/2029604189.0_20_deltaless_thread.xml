    <title>CMV: Sustainability, from a philosophical perspective, is misguided</title>
    <original_poster>Pyropeace</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've been an advocate of sustainability for a while. However, I've recently begun to question the underlying assumptions behind the sustainability movement. 

Nothing is truly, infinitely sustainable. The sun will eventually go nova, killing everyone on earth (if humans haven't already gone extinct by then). If humanity manages to escape Earth, then the universe will likely perish as well, depending on what model you accept. The universe is in a constant state of change, and nothing lasts forever. Is it better to be moderately happy for a long period of time or extremely happy for a short period of time? When talking about entire societies, I tend towards the latter, though on an individual basis I tend towards the former. 

Essentially, my question is this; what is the value in things that last a long time in a universe where nothing is eternal?</original_post>

    <text>I think the problem here is that you're misrepresenting the philosophical idea of "sustainability"  - kinda reinventing what it is and then arguing about it.

Nothing in the sustainability movement is about extending the life of the sun, for the obvious example.  However, my children will benefit from a sustainable approach to water management and forest management in cheaper drinking water and lumber prices and availability for their houses and will enjoy having more forested lands to walk in, camp in and hike in.  Sustainability allows us to do things we want to do without it decreasing others ability to do so now, and in the future.  

Isn't that valuable?</text>
