    <title>CMV: Modern marriage in the US brings more harm than benefit for men.</title>
    <original_poster>cannibalstreudel</original_poster>
    <original_post>I believe based on marriage laws and divorce practices that marriage no longer has more benefits than harm for men.

For women it's the opposite. I believe this because whether laws state this or not, practices in divorce court often grant kids' custody to the mother from the father when they aren't more dangerous to their kids than their wife. And often men have to give up half their income/assets in divorce when they often make most of the income of the household.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Sure there are emotional benefits to a long term relationship. But there aren't extra benefits for men on top of an emotionally committed relationship that exclusively comes with marriate.

The security marriage itself brings is only for the woman. She gets to enjoy financial guarantee of sharing income when men often make more than women, and she can be assured of his fidelity - it's backed up by government enforcement... women rarely are punished for fucking another guy and being impregnated at the level men are, and often the man in the marriage gets cucked and is made responsible for raising another man's child.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Men are bringing unnecessary vulnerabilities on themselves when they marry a woman in modern US courts.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

If someone can reliably demonstrate that marriage gives more potential benefit to men than potential harm, I would believe marriage brings more benefit than harm to men. And to be clear, I'm not talking about long term relationships, I'm talking about specifically signing a marriage document and putting the law behind the union.</original_post>

    <text>&amp;gt;And often men have to give up half their income/assets in divorce when they often make most of the income of the household.

Because men are often the ones that make more. If the woman makes more, the man will take half her assets. These posts always boil down to fearing women will betray men and clean them out in a divorce, but honestly, divorce gives bread winning men more protections than they realize.

So lets imagine a healthy relationship where the man and woman are, for most of their history, good partners to each other. They would have combined their assets and buying power several times and share bank and retirement accounts, credit cards, leases, a mortgage, what have you. Things become very difficult when you can't and one spouse runs into an emergency where their car breaks down and has to pay for a tow truck but lacks the funds to cover it in their own personal account and the other one is at work and cannot be reached for hours to transfer money. If one spouse doesn't trust them with that, why the hell are they married in the first place?

So lets say, such a couple has a nasty break up as is not too uncommon among couples that seemed to have a perfectly fine relationship until then to the people closest to them. Whats to stop one spouse from clearing out the accounts of all the money? What is stopping them from closing all credit accounts? Whats to stop them from exercising their rights over any account that is in their name and make life difficult for their former partner?

How can the spurned ex partner afford a lawyer to sue the other? How can a judge be expected to divide assets without a marriage contract. Can the person that emptied the account say that the agreement was the other was responsible for all expenses and their money was fun money for a vacation that they will no longer be taking so they took their money or whatever arguement the lawyer they can afford can say for their client?

Under an official divorce, a spouse tries to screw the other over like that, and they will be screwed in court. Marriage assets are automatically shared. After all, if one spouse, man or woman, decides to stay home and raise the kids and maintain their home, why should they get screwed financially for doing their part to support the family? If a man or woman moves for their spouses career because they have the higher earning potential and their career is hindered by it, why should you not have any right to the income their spouse only earned because they made the sacrifice for them?

If you fear this from your partner.... maybe break up with them. Thats some serious trust issues whether you end up being right or wrong if you *always* fear this from every potential serious relationship.

Now, lets go over a few benefits of marriage itself.

- Ability to bring your spouse under your medical insurance. Extra handy should there be step kids involved.

- Medical power of attorney. Handy for handling your medical decisions should you be incapacitated or what they do with your remains should you die.

- Tax breaks.

- Immigration. Should you soulmate be from another country, they can move to yours or you to theirs and gain citizenship.

- Rights to assets over death. Would you want the parents of your long time GF that always hated you be part or complete owners of the house you shared together after her untimely death?

There are so many more but these are just a few. Could these benefits be taken care of with a series of contracts? Sure, but why go through the trouble of running around town to different specialized lawyers filing several forms and signing several contracts and wasting all that time and money when a marriage certificate does the same thing? How much more expensive will it be to hire a lawyer to revoke those contracts should your non-spouse decide to fight you on it after you want a break up?

Why not just be more prudent in your choice of life partner and get married?</text>

    <text>This is one of the most compelling and well articulated views on this post.

To summarize your point, the benefits given to men from marriage are vast and my view is based on the effect of manipulative and deceitful partners. But even in those instances, marriage sets up many protections for me against such partners.

It's still a risk of course that hasn't changed. But you've framed it as a relationship risk, rather than a risk of marriage, and stated a few ways that marriage doesn't necessarily raise this risk but in fact mediates it.

I can see your point and that raises the benefits of marriage greatly. I do see that it is still a financial risk. A wife doesn't automatically deserve half his income. Say she moves for him and becomes naggy... Doesn't take care of the house but goes and hangs out at cafes all day or downtown.

It's a more extreme example but just because she sacrificed her career doesn't mean in the world of merit that she deserves half. But in marriage the law will give her half should she decide to call it quits. That's still a huge risk I need to be convinced is meditated by marriage and I'm not.</text>
