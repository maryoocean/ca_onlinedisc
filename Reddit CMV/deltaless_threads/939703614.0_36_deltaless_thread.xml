    <title>CMV: Where your born doesn't matter and country pride is pointless</title>
    <original_poster>Blank-VII</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't think I belong to a country and I think the concept is odd. I was born in the UK and have lived here all my life, but I fail to understand why people are so hard-core about being a 'proud brit' or anything. Where I was born isn't something I was able to decide for myself, and I want my life to be what I make out of it, not what it decides for me. I believe the only way to belong to a country is to find one whose culture is similar to your own tastes and opinions, and to move there. What's the point in being proud of a country I was born in if I feel no attachment to how it's run or anything else?

*you're

*View partially changed. Country pride is not pointless.

**Main view unchanged, it seems no-one can quite convince me. I've had some fantastic conversations and I'm really happy with how many of you engaged without being toxic. Stay safe y'all. Thanks so much!**</original_post>

    <text>Just discovered this sub and im doing some hardcore lurking. I know this isn't a recent post but I thought I'd give it a shot.

Personally I didn't feel pride for my country until I immigrated. It has nothing to do with politics. You'll feel it when you realize you have to change the way you speak just to be understood. Or when you talk about something from your childhood and no one understands. Don't get me wrong, I love meeting people from other cultures but after long enough you realize that you're not like everyone else. The novelty of feeling "special" or "exotic" fades away and it's very easy to feel isolated or misunderstood.

Then you hear someone in public speak in an accent that you recognize, or you meet someone whose been to the same places that you have, and laughs at the same jokes that you do. You don't fully appreciate someone from the same nationality until you spend enough time away from them. You develop a fierce pride for your country no matter what its like.

I've seen so many people who claim to be from my country (has a grandmother and never lived there or something) and they wear it on their shoulder for attention. They shit talk it or praise it as if they know what they're talking about. They inform other people what its like living there when they have never even been because its too dangerous/far. That kinda stuff makes me realize that I've become patriotic. Like I lived through the shit and the good times and here you are using my country for attention. Sorry this became a personal rant, but I hope you got the main point i attemmpted to make. Basically you learn to love your country when you see it from a distance (not neccesarily the way its being run, or the people in power like no way if anything youll hate them more for what they've been doing to your country)</text>
