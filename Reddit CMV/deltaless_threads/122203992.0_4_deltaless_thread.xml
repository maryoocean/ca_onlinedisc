    <title>I believe that it is in the strategic best interests of the US to militarily intervene in Ukraine. CMV</title>
    <original_poster>TEmpTom</original_poster>
    <original_post>1) The Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances. Negotiated by Ukraine, the US, the UK, and Russia in accordance to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Ukraine should give up its nuclear arms in exchange for "protection." These "protections" specify to

&amp;gt;Seek United Nations Security Council action if nuclear weapons are used against Ukraine.

&amp;gt; and 

&amp;gt;Consult with one another if questions arise regarding these commitments.

Though, the treaty does not specify any defensive pact between these powers and Ukraine if the country is invaded or threatened militarily, I still believe that it would be in the best interests of the US to treat the Budapest Memorandum as one. Due to the nature of the agreement, with vague assurances of protection in exchange for complete nuclear proliferation of the country, it would set a terrible precedent for future nuclear proliferation negotiations with countries who have just developed their nuclear arms if Ukraine is so easily attacked with close to no assistance from other powers whatsoever. Though, the Budapest Memorandum does not guarantee protection from nuclear powers, it will be interpreted as such by politicians in countries seeking nuclear weapons. Negotiations would be increasingly  difficult if they cannot guarantee protection from larger powers if they were to be attacked like Ukraine. 

2) It sets another terrible precedent of justifying foreign invasion based on a protection of ethnic [insert people of invading country here], and also a precedent of invasions and annexations without consequence. Without western response, more countries may consider it justified to invade or annex parts of weaker destabilized countries using this very excuse. A US/NATO military response may ensure that other countries seeking to invade and annex their neighboring countries could not do so without a consequence of US/NATO retaliation. Though, they may seek some other equally trumped up justification, the mere show of force in Ukraine in response to an invading force may as well deter many similar situations in the future.

3) It will weaken Russia internationally, and possibly gain the US new allies and new NATO members. A military defeat of the Russian military by US/NATO forces will definitely weaken Russia's influence regionally, and globally. Syria would possibly lose most of their support from their biggest ally, and the Russian international prestige and economy would undoubtedly be extremely weakened by their reputation in the war. Ex-Soviet states both in Eastern Europe, and Central Asia may see the threat of the Russian invasion of Ukraine to be possibly threatening to their sovereignty in the future, as well as the US' integrity in defending their allies, and other invaded nations as an assurance to their security if they joined NATO. Ukraine is definitely going to join NATO, and nobody wants to be the second Ukraine in this situation, so many of them may immediately apply for membership.

4) Diplomacy has failed, and I do not believe that the Russians will back away from the Crimea and respect Ukraine's sovereignty within its current borders with anything short of military force. I believe that sanctions would be completely ineffective to solve the current issue at hand. Even if they did hurt Russia's economy in the long run, Crimea would be long a part of Russia, and no amount of economic downturn would ever make the Russians give up that territory. 

**Why I believe US military intervention would be relatively non-disastrous.**

1) People keep saying "Russia's a nuclear power. Its going to be WW3. Nuclear holocaust" etc. I do not believe that anyone is stupid enough to escalate a regional conflict into a full scale nuclear war even if the US decides to intervene. No one is going to throw nukes at each other, not tactically or otherwise, the concept of MAD still exists. The only possibility of Russia using a nuke is 1) NATO forces have capture Moscow, and Russia is on the brink of total defeat, or 2) In retaliation to an enemy nuclear strike. Neither of these situations are going to happen in a regional conventional war between the US and Russia.

2) People say "This is going to be another Iraq/Afghan war. We don't want to spend another 3 trillion dollars on another war." Although, an intervention would cost some money, it won't be nearly as expensive as the Iraq and Afghan wars. With clear objectives to defend a country against a foreign invader, and not to invade a country to topple their government, a US military intervention would look similar to the Gulf War on a larger scale. 

3) "Europe depends on Russian oil, so the Russians have the EU by the balls." Currently, Russian oil makes up about 32.6% of total oil imports in the EU, and undoubtedly the EU will suffer from slight oil shortages in the short term. However, the US, Canada, and Saudi Arabia could use this opportunity to establish themselves as primary providers of oil to Europe. In the long term, the massive European oil market would benefit theses countries greatly, and the EU has just made itself energy independent from a major geo-political enemy. Slight price controlled exports of oil to Europe may be needed to alleviate shortages in the short run, but ultimately all of these countries would benefit from having Europe energy independent from Russia.

    <text>Just out of interest would you personally be willing to die for the decision of who the Crimean people pay taxes too? I understand you feel there is a greater principle of sovereign rights and you see some realpolitik benefits but are those great enough that you yourself would be willing to die for them?</text>

    <text>Of course not, I wouldn't be willing to fight a war no matter how just the cause was, but because we have a fully volunteer military, those that volunteered have a responsibility to preserve not only our national security, but our nation's strategic influence around the globe. There is an inherent risk in doing both those things, and our soldiers knew the risks before they signed onto the job. </text>

    <text>Yes they did. But I'm sure they did so with some level of faith that their commanders would treat their lives with respect and not take advantage of the trust they had placed in them by agreeing to take on those risks for their country. 

Even though it may not be disastrous would you say the benefits you describe would be worth the costs in lives and the irrevocable damage to the families of those lost?

Not forgetting the Crimean population. The most likely outcome right now is a relatively peaceful annexation with some disruption to families as Ukrainian nationalists request to move back to Ukraine. Considering the current political turmoil in Ukraine the shift to Russian control will most likely go smoother for the average person than staying in Ukraine, politically. Their standard of living shouldn't be affected too much, the greatest risk being Ukranian patriot uprisings. 

Personally if I was in Crimea that is the situation I would prefer rather than a war erupting and the country being ravaged with significant civilian deaths. I can't speak for the Crimean people but the fact that they have been occupied for so long with little resistance suggests that they too prefer this situation to the possibility of death. Do you think it's right for foreigners to decide that war should be forced upon them?</text>

    <text>This isn't just about Crimea and Ukraine. A military intervention, and the lack thereof would both set long term precedents concerning international politics, national sovereignty, nuclear proliferation, and also US global influence. I've mentioned the dangerous precedents inaction would set in the first 2 points of my original post.</text>

    <text>Yes it is, I agree with you that the war would most likely not be disastrous. It might be disastrous in the long term and set the world into a new cold war but short term I think it would simply be a regional conflict. So apart from long term consequences the thing you have to balance out is how willing you are to end lives and devastate a country against those points you mention.

As far as precedents, countries annexing each other is not without precedent. Countries being invaded on false pretenses especially has plenty of precedent. Crimea was also basically a part of Russia until it was gifted away during the break up of the Soviet Union and the majority of the people are Russian and everything points to them being happy to rejoin Russia. Also Ukraine was in a very messed up situation and threatening the stability of Russia's borders, the precedent while bad is not really a justification for future actions anymore than the Iraq war should have been. 

US global influence isn't affected by Russia swallowing up a tiny bit of land next to it's borders anymore than Russian global influence was by the United States swallowing up New Mexico. Some countries in the EU such as Poland might feel threatened and if Russia continued to be aggressive it would obviously be a different situation. But there is a specific context to the Crimean invasion and nothing to say that it will be a continued act, if there was, even if Russia looked to be taking more parts of Ukraine proper then there might be a better case.

Your points are all true and they are big negatives for an action like this from any country to another. But you are talking about destroying a country and a death toll that will probably be in the hundreds of thousands, as well as destabilizing an entire region. If you want to talk about nuclear proliferation then consider the dangers of destabilizing a region with one of the largest stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the world. 

I understand your argument but it's coming across as very one sided, you're talking about global influence and national sovereignty but are these things just a good in of themselves? Surely there only good so far as they serve to establish safety and quality of life for the people involved? </text>

    <text>The main precedent a US intervention would set would be seen as a consequence to invading nations and annexation of territory in the future. Why I think it will deter future nations from doing what Russia is doing now, is because it will show them that the immediate consequence of their actions would be a US military intervention. A demonstration of military force, and the willingness to use it even on a major power like Russia will intimidate and most likely deter similar future actions. Its one of the major factors of "gun-boat diplomacy" which has, historically, been proven to be a very strong US diplomatic tactic.

The thing about Ukraine is that they gave up all of their nuclear weapons in agreement with the Budapest Memorandum. They have no stockpile whatsoever, and it is believed by many people to be the reason why Russia had no qualms of invading and Annexing Ukrainian territory. Other nations will see Ukraine's example as a reason to manufacture, and keep their nuclear armaments if there is no foreign intervention (with good reason too), and if we don't want nuclear non-proliferation to die over night, the US should treat the Budapest Memorandum as a defensive pact. 

Not intervening would hurt US influence. Mainly it will make nuclear proliferation agreements much more difficult as I have already mentioned, but I'm more concerned about the potential benefits to US influence an intervention would give. Seeing, a strong reaction to a small nation being invaded by a major power would probably push many other ex-soviet countries to join NATO. If the world see's the US' willingness to defend Ukraine, then undoubtedly many nations feeling threatened by powers like China or Russia would seek US protection. It won't hurt US reputation either, a defense of a current nations sovereignty of its pre-existing borders will be seen as much more justified than its adventures in Iraq and Afghanistan. Much like the Gulf War.
