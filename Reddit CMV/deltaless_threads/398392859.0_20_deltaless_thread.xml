    <title>CMV: I don't understand why everyone loves Wonder Woman</title>
    <original_poster>LilYonsan</original_poster>
    <original_post>Could someone help a cis-gendered white male understand why critics and people alike are raving about the new Wonder Woman movie? Having seen the movie myself, I really just don't understand what all the hype is about and when I think about this movie I seem to think about three main points that I just can't get around: the movie felt formulaic, the music was sub-par and predictable, and finally the movie's role in relation to my current ideas of gender.

**Wonder Woman felt formulaic:** 
This is one of my main criticisms of the movie, and I think it has come from the movie market being over-saturated with superhero movies as of late. Other than the first two batman movies (and maybe the third), I laugh at the relative quality of DC's live-action movies compared to their Animated Universe counterpart. Wonder Woman does what every other superhero movie has already done, the only difference was that it was a female lead (which I'll get more into later), my complaint was the result to me felt uninspired and the execution of the scenes was unoriginal (When viewing many of the fight scenes in this movie, I was reminded of 300)

**The Music Felt Bland:**
As a musician myself, I feel the music also played a large role in my lack of interest. I'd like to start off this point but suggesting readers watch this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vfqkvwW2fs) to get a better understanding of where I'm coming from on this point. You don't have to, but it might help. If not, basically the point of the video is that, due to many factors, the music in movies and what composers are actually allowed to compose has been limited, resulting in a more neutral and uninspired soundtrack as a whole. There are only two sections in the movie featuring a cello playing a leading-tone into a tonic with loud drums behind it that stood out, and honestly I think the only reason it stood out was because they turned the music up slightly louder than they did the sound effects. 

**With regard to Gender:**

Which brings me to the point of this movie that I'm really trying to wrap my head around. "Maybe", I thought, "that is the point. That it's just like all of the superhero movies that feature men, but shows that a woman can do it just as well". Before I go on this topic, I'm glad to see more movies that feature female leads (this and ghostbusters I think do some good in a societal level, especially given some of the political turmoil this country has been in as of late), but if that is the entire point then, like my other complaints, movies like Kill Bill and Alien did it better because they weren't so preachy about it. To me, Wonder Woman took the approach "she does this despite the fact that she's a woman because she's powerful, rooooaaaar!!", whereas Ripley in Alien and **bleep** in Kill Bill were just badasses because they were and that was the end of discussion. 

In summary, it's not that I thought that Wonder Woman was a terrible movie, but I don't think it deserves nearly the praise and hype that it received, and I felt like I could have spent the time watching that movie doing something more meaningful. But, as I mentioned at the beginning of this topic, I'm a guy, so maybe I'm just not getting something here. Please, change my view reddit because I would really like to understand better what I don't already! 

Thanks for reading!

    <text>I'm going to say this knowing how arrogant it sounds but it seems people's tastes have just gotten worse and if something that isn't terrible comes out people get excited. Over the last few years I've greatly increased the amount of films I'm watching on a regular basis though I've always been a bit of a film nut. I used to go to the theater every week but the last few years I've skipped on seeing anything new and just watched old films that I haven't seen. I just keep seeing new favorites all the time and I'm even less keen to go out and pay a ton of money for the crap Hollywood is spewing out now. The more time you spend watching old masterpieces the more unsatisfying everything released today is. If you don't you can easily be entertained by crap. Most people just don't watch that many films. That's fine I guess they don't have to but if you have then current Hollywood has less to offer. Better films def used to be made but time also has a way of bringing the best to the top and forgetting the crap and maybe things aren't all that different today. But never before have we had instant access to the history of cinema. 


As far as the female hero element yes definitely there have been tons of great female badasses in the past in far better films that showed more realistic women and not a dumb superhero with super powers as though that means anything for real people. We just have much more ideologically driven media and blogs that push their favorite narratives regardless of facts or taste. And we are in a weird place politically where if a pet narrative is present no one wants to be criticized for being critical and somehow that's enough to warrant praise if it just hits superficial identity notes. 

I don't know. Many days I agree with BRET easton Ellis who rants every episode on his podcast that film is dead. Maybe it is. Older films were just more interesting with better ideas and richer complicated characters and even the superficial ones were still more fun and playful. Or maybe I'm just getting old. 

I think I saw six films last year that were good. Maybe that's all I can expect and that's just the way it is. But maybe people are starving for good content and after a long diet some store bought 711 pastry can taste delicious. </text>
