    <title>CMV: 'Jump scares' are a cheap party trick, and movies that are full of them shouldn't be considered horror</title>

Lately I've noticed that most horror movies rely on jump scares. Something will unexpectedly pop out at the audience, a loud noise will startle everyone, you know the works. Sometimes the movie tries to trick people into believing that a certain scene will have a jump scare, to make the viewer feel safe, and then do a jump scare in the next scene.

I think that movies like Paranormal Activity, The Conjuring and The Darkness do not do their best to scare the audience in a creative way.

Jump scares do something physical to your body. Sometimes my mom jumps out at the me when I walk through the door, to elicit a scream or a 'fear' reaction from me. However, a second later I'm just laughing because it's silly and not at all scary.

When I go see a movie at the theater that has a lot of jump scares, most of the audience members just seem to be laughing. You may hear a collective gasp or a scream, but that's just a reflex. 

Most movies riddled with jump scares do not leave an impression on me. I find them annoying.

Jump scares do not tell a story that sends shivers down your spine and causes you to lay awake at night. Jump scares do not show you a gruesome scene that will be burned into your mind for the weeks to come.

Jump scares are cheap party tricks. They are annoying and do not elicit any feelings of terror. 

Change my view.

    <text>My problem with horror movies isn't so much the jump scare, life is filled with them so they're a believable occurrence. My problem with horror movies is they often have such terrible plots with holes galore and that makes the jump scares cheesy and not so scary. There are plenty of movies with jump scares that fit, babadook was one of those for me. But the plot was also pretty interesting. It follows has maybe one jump scare, but the entirety of the movie is based on a paranoid dread which was an extremely unique experience. I feel more movies should work on the creativity and work for a greater ability for the audience to connect to the movie and the jump scares wouldn't be such a problem. I'll take jump scares over movies entirely ridden with blood and violence.

Edit: seriously if you haven't watched it follows, do so. </text>
