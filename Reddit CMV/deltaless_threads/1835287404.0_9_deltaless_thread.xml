    <title>CMV: Twitter will be transformed into a right-wing hellscape</title>
    <original_poster>newleafsauce</original_poster>
    <original_post>I fear Twitter will become yet another fringe, conspiracy-fuelled and bigoted platform like all the sites that don't moderate for misinformation or hate speech. User enjoyability will plummet and the loudest and most active sect will be those who ordinarily would be banned under the pre-Musk terms &amp;amp; conditions. 

Musk has expressed his intentions today to transform Twitter into a site that allows all free speech under the law. What does this mean? This means white supremacists, incels, misogynists, conspiracy theorists, science denialists, and anti-LGBT zealots, among other far-right groups will be able to promote the most repugnant content and disinformation, and grow their respective movements, which will inevitably spill over into the real world. They will be allowed to brigade and hate on any Twitter user who belongs to the identities they despise. And their victims can't do anything meaningful about it except to spend hours blocking harrasing accounts / DMs or to leave the platform entirely.  

The toxicity will get so bad that the  most socially-progressive people and people with non-fringe views will likely leave. Twitter will skew heavily right-wing and far-right fast under Musk. 

If you can say anything to alleviate my fears and predictions, I would be open to hearing it so I can have my mind changed on this.</original_post>

    <text>Maybe if more people had common sense and critical thinking skills, you wouldn't have to worry about what crazy shit someone posts on Twitter.</text>

    <text>I have critical thinking skills. Enough to know that unchecked platforming of far-right extremists on popular platforms will lead to a growth in far-right extremism, which will translate to real-world consequences.</text>

    <text>I think you misunderstood my point. If people were taught better to examine arguments logically and with evidence and data, they would be less likely to join extreme bandwagons. I believe that people should be held legally accountable if their speech and actions result in real-world consequences, but there is a legal protection of free speech and actual, legally defined hate speech is alot more extreme than what many people consider "hate speech". I think that part of the issue is that people are not having real dialogs with people they disagree with. When you deny someone the right to express themselves (In a way that doesn't actually hurt others) they tend to become more defensive and aggressive and that is when thoughts and words turn into actions with real consequences.</text>
