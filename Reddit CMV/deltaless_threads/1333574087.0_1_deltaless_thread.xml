    <title>CMV: We should allow Trans women in US women’s sports to gain more viewers.</title>
    <original_poster>handologon</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let’s be honest here: no one was talking about US women’s sports before Trans women starting joining the teams. 

Only 4% sports coverage has been devoted to women athletes. But now that Trans women are coming out to play, maybe it’ll be more interesting? I honestly was against the idea of Trans women competing in women’s teams until I realized this. 

Allow a limit of 1-2 Trans women per team so they don’t completely dominate, but it is enough to make people actually want to watch. The increased coverage can make more money for Colleges and official leagues, allowing biological females in leagues to make more money. In order to evenly disperse transgender athletes, there can be full ride sports scholarships given at each university for one to two transgender student. Of course biological females will get full ride scholarships as well, and likely there can be more given out due to more viewers. If our concern is safety, extra safety measures can be put in place. Also we should only start this with non-fighting sports, so no wrestling, cage fighting, or boxing. 

This is the video that inspired my thoughts:

Does this make sense? If not, change my view.</original_post>

    <text>Would you also allow the use of performance enhancing drugs or doping? 

I agree with you that we do need to increase viewership of women's sports.</text>

    <text>Do we? This is clearly its own CMV post, but is there really any need to boost viewership of women’s sports? 

I get that men’s basketball players are millionaires and childhood heroes while women’s players are working two jobs. But no one knows or cares about men’s racquetball, and we’re not making a push to raise viewership there. Why is the fact that men’s basketball is popular an indicator that women’s basketball should be popular?

The counterpoint is men’s soccer, of course, where they bring in more money and make less money. That’s a fully different discussion.</text>

    <text>I agree with you that viewership, and by extension pay, is at least one CMV post.</text>

    <text>No. The trans women who compete should be taking estrogen, which if anything, is performance decreasing. 

And yeah, they really need it.</text>
