    <title>CMV: Polyamory will never actually work.</title>
    <original_poster>AndrewBlue3</original_poster>
    <original_post>You can't have the same intimacy with a person in that kind of relationship. There will be alot of jelaousy and you can choose to ignore it or act upon it and neither is good for you. 
There is a specific kind of people that "succeed" in polyamory and they are always dyed hair liberals and the relationships are really immature. It's always processed fake love and people that go into it expecting some real and eyeopening experience end up gettining hurt.
What is the point in overcoming jelousy or learning to live with it ? It is what i always hear from poly people. Jelousy is a natural reaction and it is there for a reason, if i am not jelous that my girl is fucking with some other guy/girl that means that i don't really care for her that much anymore.
I mean have you ever been in some wider circle of friends. You know how that shit goes. Now imagine that in a relationship, it goes x10 worse.
At the end i think it is all about sex and how much shit you can take in order to have multiple sex partners at once.

Just don use "well you wouldnt eat the same food everyday no matter how much you love it" or "well you do love both of your parents equaly" kind of arguments.</original_post>

    <text>but who are you to decided it was processed fake love? You can't judge someones love based on what they let be seen by a stranger.

have you been with them when they are alone? have you seen them in any sort of intimate (not sexual) moment? or do you watch clips and videos of someone online and make your judgement.

you also showed your own very biased opinion saying they are all immature dyed hair liberals. their political views or fashion has nothing to do with how they love, but you are projecting your (now I'm projecting a bit here) traditional christian values and are assuming your way is the only right way and any other way is fake.

You also mention that jealousy is an indicator of love. If I get so jealous that my woman even talks to male co-workers that I forbid her to work, does that mean my love for her is stronger than yours? Jealousy is a largely selfish base instinct, like being horny or hungry, just because some people have varying levels and varying reactions to it, doesn't mean it defines them.</text>
