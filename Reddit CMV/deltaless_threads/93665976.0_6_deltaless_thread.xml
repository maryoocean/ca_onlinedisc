    <title>Street Smart and Book Smart are two different types of intelligence. CMV.</title>
    <original_poster>frog_dog_outlaw</original_poster>
    <original_post>For the term "smart" I am referring to the combination of *knowledge - knowing something with familiarity gained through experience* and *intelligence - the ability to apply why you have learned*. (my own interpretations of the definitions) To me book smart refers to academic achievements and success or how well you did in school etc. Street smart is almost instinctive; its more than just common sense, it is being able to adapt and change with your environment. I am not saying you can't have both, but they are two different measures of intellect. Change my view.</original_post>
