    <title>CMV: the clock in a soccer game should be stopped for stoppages, rather than adding stoppage time.</title>

    <original_post>I was having a sports-related discussion with my brother in law earlier today and we stumbled on this topic.  Neither of us are big soccer fans, but we both like sports in general. We both watch football (which has its own flaws) and baseball (which also has its flaws). I later found this article:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2014/06/12/stoppage-time-in-soccer-how-it-works-and-what-it-means/?noredirect=on

I still don’t understand why a referee in charge of timing can’t just stop the clock for things like injuries, goals, and such. My reasoning:

* Other timed sports have this mechanism. The clock stops in American football for various events. The clock stops in hockey for fouls and goals. The clock stops in basketball for fouls (and I believe after baskets later in the game, in some formats). 
* The clock not stopping and leaving it to the referee to determine stoppage length leads to time-wasting that is against the spirit of competition, even if it is not technically against the rules - think of the instances of a player knocking the ball away from an opponent about to throw the ball in, or continuing to dribble the ball away from opponents when it is not their possession. These tactics, along with the prevalence of flopping, IMO, are detrimental to gaining new fans, especially in America.
* Knowing exactly when a game (or period of play) ends is better than the referee deciding it in any semi-arbitrary manner. The article I linked mentions that referees are unlikely to blow the play dead in the middle of an attack. I think that this is bad practice. The clock runs out on American football teams in the middle of a drive all the time. Basketball players are forced to take an unlikely shot because the clock is running out and the ref isn’t going to let them just play out the whole possession after the clock hits zero.
* If guidelines and best practices exist as to when to add stoppage time, including stoppage time during stoppage time, why can’t rules exist regarding stopping the clock? Discretion is a dangerous thing, especially when being influenced by a home crowd. 

CMV, folks. I like sports. I’d like to appreciate soccer more, even if I don’t go out of my way to watch games outside the World Cup,

Edit: I’ve heard the argument about stoppages leading to commercials. I don’t buy that. Soccer stoppages aren’t generally long enough to squeeze in ads. There aren’t timeouts, the (terrible) concept of a TV timeout doesn’t exist like it does in basketball games, you’re not gonna cut away during a penalty kick (where the clock runs), and injuries suck but I don’t see any loss of value if you replace footage of a guy on the turf getting stretchered off with a commercial or two.</original_post>

    <text>I'm going to make one point.
All the European leagues differ in styles. If you've seen a premiere league game you know that if the game is close at stoppage time is when the players give it their all and show the best football.  stoppage time is perfect because you know it will be anywhere from 2' to 5'. a goal can be scored in seconds. What amazing feat would it be, were the players able to score one or even two goals in stoppage time to win a game that five minutes earlier in regular time seemed lost. If the time ran longer we would lose the emotions that football brings. 

&amp;gt;These tactics, along with the prevalence of flopping, IMO, are detrimental to gaining new fans, especially in America.

the reason why soccer hasn't gained in America is because networks haven't found a way to cram hours of commercial into such an action packed sport. </text>

    <text>I’m going to edit my post to address the commercial thing because I’m getting that argument a lot- that stoppages lead to commercials and that makes the game less watchable. Commercials do make the game worse, but soccer stoppages aren’t long enough for that.

To address stoppage time bringing out the best in your players- why can’t they play with the same urgency when there are 5 minutes left in regulation time?</text>
