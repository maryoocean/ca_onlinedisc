    <title>CMV: Where your born doesn't matter and country pride is pointless</title>
    <original_poster>Blank-VII</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't think I belong to a country and I think the concept is odd. I was born in the UK and have lived here all my life, but I fail to understand why people are so hard-core about being a 'proud brit' or anything. Where I was born isn't something I was able to decide for myself, and I want my life to be what I make out of it, not what it decides for me. I believe the only way to belong to a country is to find one whose culture is similar to your own tastes and opinions, and to move there. What's the point in being proud of a country I was born in if I feel no attachment to how it's run or anything else?

*you're

*View partially changed. Country pride is not pointless.

**Main view unchanged, it seems no-one can quite convince me. I've had some fantastic conversations and I'm really happy with how many of you engaged without being toxic. Stay safe y'all. Thanks so much!**</original_post>

    <text>Well youre british im not surprised(just kidding mostly). Look ill give nationalism has lead to some of our darkest points in human history. But honestly, id say it can be a nations greatest strength. Being American i can only use my country so yeah im biased but whatever you know beforehand. During world war 2 Admiral Yamamoto was avidly against starting a war against the US. He said something along the lines of "you cant invade the american mainland. There would be an american behind every blade of grass." Now this can be taken at face value saying there are a lot of guns here. Fair point, but i think theres more to the statement. He had been to America before the war. I think he saw our potential to rally behind our name. A nation with no similar national origin, yet fully united under one banner. Unshakable in will, and more than willing to die for what we believe to be right. Now i would argue that our nationalism has been abused. And its killing our national spirit besides all the degenerates saying that it should be something of shame. Now our national spirit is flagging, and our nation has never been in a worse state. I truly feel if (reasonable) levels of nationalism were to return to our core values it would really help us as a nation heal from past mistakes so we could walk together to the future</text>
