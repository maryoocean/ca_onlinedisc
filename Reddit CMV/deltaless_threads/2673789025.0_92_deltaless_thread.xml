    <title>CMV: The notion that the Democrats or Republicans "must" run Biden or Trump "because there are no other viable candidates" is ridiculous. There are thousands of people who would make better presidential candidates for 2024 than Biden or Trump.</title>

    <original_post>Every argument for Biden or Trump to run in 2024 boils down to some version of "status quo" or "inertia." We're told that the Ds and Rs have no choice but to run these super-old candidates because there's nobody else who could be suitable.

&amp;#x200B;

In a nation of 332,000,000 people, there are well over 100 million who are over the age of 35, American-born, and have resided in the United States for 14 years or more - in other words, are constitutionally eligible to run for president.

Out of those 100 million, surely at least half have a basic education, are mature, sensible, decent people, and have demonstrated solid character - and also be significantly younger than Trump or Biden.

Out of those 50 million, surely at least ten million would qualify as *highly* educated - the metrics of which can be tricky to figure out (is it a master's degree? or something else?) - but they would be significantly above average.

Out of those 10 million, surely at least one million would be quite exceptional - people who have substantially high IQ, have advanced quite far in life and a career - such as being a doctor, or having worked in public governmental service for decades, etc.

And out of those million, surely at least 10,000 would have the political know-how, the charisma, the political interest, maybe have spent significant time abroad in foreign countries or speak multiple languages, to be a suitable president.

In fact, even in Congress, state legislatures or governorships alone, there must be dozens of good, qualified, educated, experienced politicians who would be much younger than Trump or Biden, and who would make suitable presidential candidates. 

So, CMV on this one. I don't buy for one moment the notion that, in a nation of 332 million people, America somehow has no choice but to run Biden vs. Trump in 2024 because "we've got no one else who'd be a good candidate."  </original_post>

    <text>It's not about viability or qualifications.


Hillary Clinton was arguably the most qualified presidential candidate in modern history (but a terrible campaigner) and trump, a comically unqualified candidate, beat her. Biden narrowly defeated trump in part because people wanted a return to normalcy after the chaos of trump. 


Biden has done an objectively very good job as president and running again with the benefit of his record against trump it makes logical sense that he should prevail again. Due to the inevitable consequences of a trump return to power (he has declared intentions if he is re-elected that would destroy our country) democrats are pragmatically unwilling to rock the boat.


Republicans literally can't run any other candidate and have any hope of winning. Decades of appealing to increasingly angry single issue voters to seize power without majority appeal left them susceptible to someone like trump. Republicans pretended to give a shit about guns and abortion because they wanted those easily manipulated voters to help them get tax cuts for their wealthy donors. Trump has seized all of those voters by promising to give them what they want and he's actually delivering. He doesnt care about tax cuts as much as personal power and immunity from cinsequences so he's not worried about killing the golden goose (single issue voters that can be manipulated to vote for anything based on a promise thats never fulfilled). Trump will give those voters what they crave if they merely allow him to personally enrich himself and avoid prison. He doesn't care if that means turning America into an impoverished hellscape governed like Gilead by the freedumb caucus or makes it impossible for the republicans to win an honest election ever again. His long term planning only extends to the end of his life, maybe 15 years optimistically given how rapidly he is visibly declining, and plenty of dictators have clung to power for that long. 


Right now trump can destroy almost any republican who opposes him by turning enough of their own voters against them that they will likely lose a primary or certainly lose a general election. With this power he has changed enough gop state primary rules that he effectively cannot lose. Every time he gets at least half the votes he'll take all the delegates in enough states that he'll have the nomination sewed up by super tuesday. With other gop candidates tripping over themselves for a chance to ride his coat tails he's going to win those delegates.


So, the GOP made a monster that they neglected and abused. Trump brefriended it and is using it to eat their lunch. If they want his leftovers they have to do whatever he says.


Democrats always get pragmatic when the chips are down. They know better qualified candidates regularly lose to more charismatic ones (Gore, Kerry, Hillary). They know the stakes for the country are too high to allow trump a second term. They have a succesful record to run on in a match up they won before and they can't puck someone else without introducing an unacceptable risk to the continuance of America as a country. So we go home home with the date we came to the dance with.</text>
