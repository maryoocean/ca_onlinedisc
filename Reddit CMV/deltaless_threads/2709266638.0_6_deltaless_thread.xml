    <title>CMV: Gaza could be free if Hamas would stop attacking Israel</title>
    <original_poster>Ok_Contribution_6321</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm not trying to debate the whole Israel-Palestine conflict but just a small part and I'm very open to changing my view. My thought process is:

* Israel is not trying to settle/colonize/etc Gaza - quite the opposite given that they pulled out and removed settlers in 2005
* The blockade, border wall, and bombings are a response to attacks by Hamas (even if you consider them disproportional)
* Without giving up its territorial claims for all of Israel, Hamas could truly disarm, stop firing rockets and building tunnels, renounce genocidal claims, etc, and instead focus on putting all the aid money toward the people of Gaza
* If they did that in a verifiable way, Israel would have no justification for the blockade or attacks and Gazans could live in peace rather than an "open air prison" as some like to say

tldr; Gaza could have peace and prosperity if Hamas would stop attacking Israel. This would be without renouncing their territorial claims over all of Israel.

    <text>gaza was not free for 20 years, before hamas even existed. the west bank isn't controlled by hamas, and it's not free either.

&gt;Israel is not trying to settle/colonize/etc Gaza - quite the opposite given that they pulled out and removed settlers in 2005

but there were trying to do that at some point, right? otherwise, there wouldn't have been settlers to remove in 2005. that they aren't actively building settlements right now, doesn't mean they don't want to do that in the future. if they gave up control of gaza, they'd no longer have that option.

&gt;The blockade, border wall, and bombings are a response to attacks by Hamas (even if you consider them disproportional)

the attacks by hamas are a response to the blockade and the bombings (even if you consider them disproportional).

&gt;If they did that in a verifiable way, Israel would have no justification for the blockade or attacks and Gazans could live in peace rather than an "open air prison" as some like to say

does israel have a justification for building settlements in the west bank? or do they maybe just not care that much about having justifications?</text>

    <text>The Hamas rocket strikes are often retaliation for what happens in the West Bank, like when Ben Gvir visited Temple Mount, or a Palestinian died at the hands of a settler, etc. Whether they are disproportional is a separate question (and of course the Oct 7th attacks are _very_ disproportional)</text>
