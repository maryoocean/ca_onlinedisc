    <title>CMV: Killing baby cows for food is no more immoral than killing adult cows for food.</title>
    <original_poster>Arandur</original_poster>
    <original_post>Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world. Given that killing animals for food is not generally immoral^1 ,  there is not such a great difference between the experience of a baby cow and an adult cow that one will experience death any differently than the other; neither is the life of a cow so rich and fulfilling^2 that it's immoral to deprive a baby cow of it before it dies.

Therefore, I should not feel any worse eating veal than I do eating a hamburger.

^1 If you disagree with this, that's a different argument entirely; I'm glad to hear your opinion on the matter, but you won't change my view unless your argument assumes this point.

^2 Just the opposite, presently; the lives of cows are full of pain and discomfort, because our (American) food-raising process is horrifying. I *do* think that this is unethical, just based on the principle that pain is a bad thing, but it's not a massive priority for me because I think the amount of human suffering is significantly greater at this time than the amount of animal suffering (due to the greater capacity of a human to experience suffering). Again, this isn't the topic of my CMV, but if you want to give your opinion on the matter I'd be glad to hear it.

    <text>Since the lives of cattle are unpleasant, on the surface it seems that slaughtering them at an earlier age would minimize suffering and would therefore be less immoral.

The reality of veal however, is that it is essentially a by-product of the dairy industry.  To keep cows lactating they must constantly be producing calves.  Excess male calves are often used for veal rather than raised as steers, or (very rarely) breeding bulls simply because it takes less time and space away from their more profitable mothers.  A dairy cow generally lives about 5 years until it's milk production wanes, while steers raised for meat are only forced to live 18 months or so, and obviously veal calves get to die very quickly.

So while killing baby cows may alleviate more suffering than killing adult cows for food, in practice it is inextricably linked to keeping adult cows alive for food, causing them to suffer far more than they would had they been raised for meat rather than milk.  Add to the fact that many of these calves wouldn't have to be born or suffer at all if not for their essential role in keeping dairy cows lactating.</text>

    <text>So the dairy industry is the real bad guy here! I'm not sure where this puts veal vs beef on the morality scale, but thank you for the further insight into the whole sordid mess.</text>

    <text>How do you qualify your assumption that dairy cows suffer just being dairy cows? Do you work in the dairy industry?</text>

    <text>In accordance with the OP's 2nd footnote, where it is asserted that cows do suffer, and the process by which food is raised is "horrifying".</text>

    <text>Sorry about that. If that is a premise to the discussion then I retract.</text>
