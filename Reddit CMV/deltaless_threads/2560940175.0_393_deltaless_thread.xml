    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

Your professor and classmates are idiots.  They have absolutely no clue what they are talking about, and probably just want to feel special.  It happens here. 

For some reason, academics here grab on to the most pointlessly absurd ideas and then push them with the energy of Robin Williams in top form.

Tell them they are disrespecting your heritage and remind your British classmates that breaking away from an empire was the entire point; it's been over two centuries, and they should get over it already.</text>
