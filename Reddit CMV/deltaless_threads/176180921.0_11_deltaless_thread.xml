    <title>CMV: I think atheism is the better path than religion, as it can cause less conflicts</title>
    <original_poster>theraiderofreddit</original_poster>
    <original_post>Today, the world is filled with conflicts between religious groups. People rush to defend their religion, and think of other's religion as inferior. People are fighting wars sorely on the basis of religion, and the recent Charlie Hebdo massacre was done on the grounds of religion.

I am here with an alternate proposal: That of no religion at all, aka atheism. Of course, I don't mean eradication of Religion. That would be impossible. I am just saying that a world without religion would be a world with less conflicts.

One may pose the argument that the institution of religion unites people under a single umbrella, but that ship has passed. There are too many sects, too many divisions too many views for this to be effective. If one is not driven by religion, there would be less chances of conflicts. I don't mean no conflicts at all. 

Conflicts are bound to happen, but religious conflicts are one of the major factors. So why not remove religion from the equation and unlock a more peaceful world?</original_post>

    <text>Atheism is neither the cause of nor the cure to the world's problems.  Affluent, educated atheists in Western Europe are among the happiest people in the world, but they are also affluent and educated.  Under Mao and Stalin, both atheists who required atheism in their countries and many neighboring countries, tens of millions of people were killed or starved needlessly.</text>

    <text>If I read correctly, then you mean Mao and Stalin caused deaths because they were trying to convert people into Atheism. However, what I proposed won't be possible in the real world. I am just saying that in a world where Atheism is prevalent, there will be less conflicts.</text>

    <text>So in other words what you are saying is there will be peace when everyone who disagrees with you is dead or stops?

By that logic you could put almost any religion in and achieve the same result. If everyone was a devout fundamentalist Muslim, there would be less conflicts.

&amp;gt; I am just saying that in a world where Atheism is prevalent, there will be less conflicts.

Why? So far athiesm is batting .000 when it comes to nation states which ascribe to their ideology. Compare that to overtly Christian nations within the 20th century and I'd say Christianity is doing far better in terms of advancing peace.</text>

    <text>He was pointing out tht socialist countries are secular and they are violent and opressive. Look at the iraq and Afghanistan war they were caused by government/corporate greed and civilian apathy. Even the inquisition happened because of Spains king at the time; the church was merely obeying a king. </text>
