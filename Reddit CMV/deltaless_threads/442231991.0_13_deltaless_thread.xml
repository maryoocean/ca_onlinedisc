    <title>CMV: Christianity is held together through fear</title>
    <original_poster>M1STER_B0NES</original_poster>
    <original_post>My opinion is that if the fear of going to Hell was not present in the Christian ideology, then most of the followers of the religion would not be there.

Before I decided I was agnostic, that was my only reason for continuing to identify with the religion. Then, I decided I wasn't going to let fear control me. 

All in all, I don't see how this is any different than blackmailing a person to do what you want. You present your instruction, then tell them how you will completely devastate their life if they do not follow through.</original_post>

Unfortunately, and to great discredit to the name of Christ, there is a huge population of people who have a theology based on singular verses greatly taken out of context. The Gospel is a message that Paul says in 1 Corinthians, confounds the wise. 

21 For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe.
22 For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom,
23 but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles,
24 but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. (1 Corinthians 1:21, ESV)

And you will notice that when Paul preaches the Gospel, his primary points are:
1.	God is holy and must punish sin. 
2.	God told prophets centuries before that he would send an ultimate sacrifice. 
3.	That sacrifice came in Jesus Christ. 
4.	Knowing that we were in open rebellion against Him, Christ died for us. 

Now, I understand how you can get the perception that fear of hell is the primary “glue” of the faith. But when you look at our great examples of preachers, they did not continually harp on hell. If there is no punishment for sins, God cannot be just and therefore cannot make us holy like Him one day. So salvation cannot exist without a knowledge of hell.

However, remaining in Christianity should have nothing to do with continuing to fear hell. Anyone who preaches that is ignoring grace. Grace is a completely underserved gift and can never be repaid with human action or human merit.  We are commanded to be holy because our God is holy and while we were still sinners, He died for us, not out of fear of hell. </text>
