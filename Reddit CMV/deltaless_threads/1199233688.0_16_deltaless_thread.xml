    <title>CMV: America has far greater freedom of speech than Europe.</title>
    <original_poster>achicomp</original_poster>
    <original_post>My view is that free speech is factually more free in America than the European Union + UK overall. None of the following ever happens in America and never could under the US constitution:

In Austria, a woman was **convicted for blasphemy** when she called the Prophet Muhammad a pedophile. In Austria, Germany and Poland the offence carries a potential prison sentence as well as a fine.

In France, 12 protesters were **fined** for supporting the boycott of Israel.

In Denmark, a politician was **convicted for burning Korans.**

A German politician was **criminally charged** for calling migrants “scum.”

In England, a Baptist minister was **jailed overnight** for preaching against homosexuality and a man was investigated for telling a Nelson Mandela **joke**.

Also in a poll of German citizens. Only 18% of Germans feel free to express their opinions in public. 59% of Germans did not even feel free expressing themselves in private among friends. And just 17% felt free to express themselves on the Internet.

    <text>You may be right here. I dont know exactly how freedom of speach works in the US, but in most parts of Europe, that goes by the principles of Kant. Means that your freedom ends with the freedom of your next.  " your right to swing your fist ends before my nose."
That concludes to punish speech that was only spoken to hurt others. Sometimes it leads to strange laws, like the Blasphemie-Paragraph in Germany (which is not really used iirc).
The last example was from a very rightwing newspaper that is known to cry that its the end of a free society. And the publisher is known for lying ( check BILD Zeitung their crasiest newspaper). I have not checked thast source, but I dont believe anything Springer says.
On the other hand, political discussions can be very tough here. We have authoritan rights as well as communists in our parliaments.and they have the right to express their opinions.</text>
