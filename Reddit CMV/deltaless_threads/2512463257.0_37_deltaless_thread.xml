    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>My year 7 maths teacher wore a hijab and it never made the slightest difference to anything. It didn't affect her ability to teach maths and none of my classmates openly expressed that they were bothered by it. 
Visible expressions of faith aren't icky or gross or whatever you seem to think they are. As long as someone's beliefs don't infringe upon a good learning environment then who cares if they wear a cross or turban?</text>
