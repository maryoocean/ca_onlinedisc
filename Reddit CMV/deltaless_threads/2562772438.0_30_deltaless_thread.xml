    <title>CMV: It is illogical to not believe in Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>LAMARR__44</original_poster>
    <original_post>Many people either believe in Hard Determinism or Compatibilism. I will argue that both are illogical.

Both argue that human actions are extensions of factors we do not have a choice over. Compatibilism seems to say we are still free but just redefines free will to the internal factors behind a decision, but the decision is still decided by a chain of events outside of our control.

My argument is a sort of wager argument. Either libertarian free will exists or it doesn’t. If it exists and we believe in it, we have made a free decision where we are right. If libertarian free will doesn’t exist, the decision to believe in libertarian free will was out of our control.

So either we have a choice and we can make the right choice, or we don’t have a choice and were determined to be wrong.

Thus it makes more sense to believe in libertarian free will since it’s potentially the only one where we have a chance to make a right choice, if determinism is true there is no choice, so there’s no value in being right.</original_post>

    <text>I find your argument rather funny. In fact, I find any "argument" for free will rather funny, but this one, especially so.

You believe in free will because of X reason. That is your argument. 

For you, you believe in free will because you read a study that showed some people were happier believing in ree will. A part of you, therefore, feels that it is better to believe an untrue thing that will make you happier than it is to believe a true thing that makes you less happy. 

That is a deterministic causal chain. You just haven't interrogated why you believe that.

I dont think anyone here can convince you. Not because you arent willing to change your view or because we are wrong, but because it seems that you value different things to people making determinist arguments.

What I will argue is that I am happy living in a determinist world. When I look back at my decisions I know that even if they went wrong, they were the best decision I could make in that moment. It allows me to affect how I make decisions in the future so that they are more likely to turn out good by reflecting on and learning from past decisions.</text>

    <text>My argument is that if free will is true, I am free to make the right decision. If determinism is true, no one is free to make any right decision, so I am forced to believe in free will. So either I’m right, or there’s nothing else I can do about it. For you, you’re either wrong, or there’s nothing else you can do about it.</text>

    <text>But why does that dictate that it is logical to believe in free will when there is no evidence for the existence of free will?</text>

    <text>Because either I can use my freedom to come to a logical conclusion, or I am forced into a belief. Moreover, there isn’t evidence for determinism as well. So the burden of proof is on the determinist since free will is intuitive.</text>

    <text>Why is free will intuitive?

Also, your first sentence seems to be making a circular argument. To me, it's reading as this:

"It is logical to choose to believe in free will because that way I am making a choice and have free will." 

If this isn't your argument, let me know as I dont want to strawman you, but that's what im understanding. 

As for determinism having evidence, it does. There is tons of evidence for it. 

We can talk about how the brain is intrinsically tied to personality and decisions. We have an excellent understanding of how damaging different parts of the brain will have different effects on peoples emotions, behaviours, and personality. We have loads of evidence that altering the chemistry in the brain will affect peoples emotions, personality, and behaviours.

Then, there is the entire study of psychology. Which is, in essence, trying to understand why people do things. 

There are many theories within psychology. Behaviourism suggests that people learn by experiencing environmental stimuli. This could be an antecedent stimulus that teaches a reflex, such as Pavlov feeding dogs and ringing a bell, teaching them to salivate when a bell rings. It could be a consequence of past actions, such as reinforcement or punishment. 

There is also Biological psychology, which looks at how our biology affects us. This looks at how brain structires and chemical balances us, but also how genetics play a role. For example, separated identical twins are more likely to both develop certain behavioural disorders than separated fraternal twins. This shows that genetics play a role in how our brains are structured, which plays a role in decision making. 

Social Learning Theory states that like Behaviourism, external factors affect decision making, but also that we can learn from how they affect others, not just ourselves. Child A observes Child B hit another child and then gets punished. Child A learns that hitting people leads to being punished, so it is less likely to hit someone. 

There are many approaches to psychology, and I think most of them are correct. They all describe various factors that affect our behaviour.

So Determinism IS founded in evidence. It is founded in lots of evidence. 

What we do not have is any evidence of something else. For Free Will to be true, there must be something else that affects our behaviour. Something unrelated to the brain or our memory or genetics or anything else that is evidenced as influencing our behaviour. There is no evidence that such a thing exists. 

The burden on proof lies with those arguing for Free Will. We have evidence that our decisions are affected by a whole host of factors that are predetermined. We dont have evidence for a part of our mind that is not tied to these factors. So you are making the claim that this exists. 

Lastly, I would ask you to provide a single example of a decision that you have made that was not predetermined by all of these factors.</text>

    <text>Psychology doesn’t prove determinism but only explains human behaviour. I agree that our decisions are influenced by external factors but not 100% controlled. Moreover, the brain is significantly coorelated with our mind, but there is an explanatory gap between our brain and our consciousness. It isn’t explained by neuroscience on how the consciousness emerges. Since the consciousness is what makes free decisions, neuroscience doesn’t give us the whole picture. We don’t have a complete picture of how the brain is functioning when a decision is made. Some studies shown brain activity in the lead up to a decision, some show no brain activity in the lead up to a decision, some show that when a person decides to stop a decision, they halt brain activity. The evidence is a lot more nuanced. There isn’t really one side with more empirical evidence at this point in time. So the burden of proof is on the determinist to argue against the natural intuition that we have free will.</text>

    <text>I do not understand why you believe that free will is more intuitive and even if it is, that doesnt mean it does not have the burden of proof.

Lets put it this way. 

There is evidence that decisions are impacted by numerous factors as per determinism. Determinism is just saying that our choices are based on an array of factors about our life experience. We have clear evidence for that. And Im sorry but "Psychology doesnt prove determinism, but only explains human behaviour." My dude THAT is evidence for determinsm. Thats not to say it is evidence that free will does not exist, but it is proof of the determinist point of view that these factors affect decisions and behaviour. 

There is currently no evidence that a "consciousness" is separate from those many factors. You claim that the consciousness is what makes free decisions. What is your evidence for this claim? Just because science does not currently explain it doesnt mean we can just insert Free Will as the answer. Absence of evidence is not evidence. You cant fill the gap with what you think is preferable. 

So we have determinism with evidence to support its claims, and free will, which is filling in the supposed gap in the evidence.

Im sorry but it is more logical to believe that which had evidence. 

I cant help but notice you did not answer my question. You did not give any examples of decisions that you made using your free will that were not determined. I really would like to hear your answer.</text>

    <text>So the only evidence is that psychology finds that things affect human behaviour? No action makes 100% of people act the same way, so how is this determinism? Where is the evidence of determinism?</text>

    <text>Thanks for both ignoring my question and strawmanning my points for the second time.

To answer your question, it is because people have different brains and life experiences. People learn different things in their life. They are affected by these different experiences in different ways. 

It is proof for determinism because the premise of determinism is simply that there is a vast number of factors that affect our decision-making in a way that means we only have an illusion of free speech. We make our decisions based on all of these factors. If we were to change any of these factors, whether that is your past life experience, brain structure, brain chemistry in that moment, temperature or weather, emotions, so on so forth. All these things impact our decisions. 

So if we know that these factors are factors for our decisions and we categorically cannot observe any other aspect of the self that impacts our decisions, the logical conclusion is determinism. 

Your only argument is that you think that maybe there is something else that is gives us free will but we have no evidence for it. Are there gaps in our knowledge? Yes. Does that mean you can say therefore Free Will? No.

If you suffer certain types of brain damage, your personality can completely change. How does that fit in with Free Will? If you would make a completely different decision after a change to your brain, how could you say you have Free Will? 

We know that children raised by abusive parents are significantly more likely to develop mental health problems, which in turn affects their decisions. 

So. For the THIRD time, please give me an example of a decision you made that shows your Free Will. It can be anything. I would love if you would answer it this time. I really would.</text>
