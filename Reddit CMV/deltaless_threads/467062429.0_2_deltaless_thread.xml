    <title>CMV - President Trump's "shithole" comment about Haiti is not inaccurate, and because Haiti receives American aid, it should not complain</title>
    <original_poster>Petrus_</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'll focus strictly on Haiti for this.

Calling certain countries shitholes isn't incorrect. I'm not arguing Trump should've said it, but I am going to defend his assertion that Haiti is a shithole, and it shouldn't complain while it receives American aid.

Shithole is defined as:

A very dirty or unpleasant place

Haiti is a shithole, as it has widespread cholera, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, typhoid, and leprosy. All of these diseases are spread in unclean conditions, and all of these are unpleasant diseases, qualifying Haiti as a shithole. In addition, if you look at images of Haiti, the gutters are filled with garbage, the sanitation is horrible, or simply doesn't exist, and most of the country lives in squalor.

To compound this, Haiti is also extremely poor, with the average person getting $350 per year, which is ridiculously low, and can in no way be considered pleasant, further qualifying Haiti as unpleasant, and therefore a shithole.

My final point is that Haiti should not complain about calling a shithole (At least not without expecting some repercussions on it's aid), as it is both accurate, and it is receiving foreign aid to "fix" its problems. Each year, the United States spends $1.5 billion in Haiti (I've seen conflicting sources on the exact number, but the point still stands), which is a huge amount of money. In addition, the US provides 500k meals each day to Haitian students, so without the US, Haitians would be starving, so they shouldn't complain while we literally feed their kids.

Tldr: Haiti meets the definition of a shithole, by being both dirty and unpleasant, so Trump's comment was not inaccurate, and Haiti shouldn't complain by biting the hand that (Literally) feeds them.</original_post>

    <text>Except the reason Haiti is a shithole is, at least partially, because of the US. 

So it's roughly be the equivalent of going over a friends house, throwing stuff all over the floor, and using the fact there's stuff on the floor as justification for calling them dirty.</text>

    <text>I would be interested in hearing an elaboration here. What has the US done that can be blamed for Haiti's present situation?</text>

    <text>The US refused to recognize Haiti as a country for 60 years after the revolution, and sanctioned them until 1863. The US occupied Haiti from 1915 to 1934, collecting taxes instead of the Haitian government. The US backed two dictators, the Duvlaiers, from 1957 to 1986, which killed many people and cause Haiti to rack up debt. Then they supported a 2004 coup against Haiti's elected president. </text>

    <text>Interesting, this helps explain it.

And don't forget the concept of ripple effects; when you destroy a country's economy on a *massive* scale like this, you subsequently destroy the lives of children and young people on a massive scale.

And those young people who grew up overburdened by socioeconomic and sociopolitical circumstances they had no fault in later grow up to become the adults of that country in the future.

It never stops with the people who were immediately affected by the policy. It trickles down to the next generation.</text>

    <text>At the time, not recognizing new nations wasn't uncommon, and Haiti was a special case, as it was the product of a revolt from one of our best allies. 

The Haitian occupation didn't ruin the country. While it was extremely bad, it did lead to better infrastructure in the country, but the debt point is kind of pointless, as no country today has no debts.

The US didn't support the Duvaliers, and he didn't like the US either, often accusing us of supporting the DR over them, and his regime killed 5 Americans. 

The 2004 coup is hard to blame America for, as he got on the plane willingly, and the fighting was spawned by the brutal execution of a gang leader, who's followers and other rebels would likely try to do the same to Aristide.</text>

Neither of those things are any less shitty, or remove culpability from the US.

It didn't 'ruin the country' by itself, no, but it certainly didn't help.

&amp;gt;The US didn't support the Duvaliers, and he didn't like the US either, often accusing us of supporting the DR over them, and his regime killed 5 Americans.

Hell yeah we supported them at first. We might have pulled away from them later, but we helped put them into power.

&amp;gt;The 2004 coup is hard to blame America for, as he got on the plane willingly, and the fighting was spawned by the brutal execution of a gang leader, who's followers and other rebels would likely try to do the same to Aristide.

Aristide himself claims it was a kidnapping, and the Dominican Republic claims that the US helped train and arm the rebels. Obviously, the US has denied it, but of course they would.</text>

It doesn't make Haiti our problem though

&amp;gt;It didn't 'ruin the country' by itself, no, but it certainly didn't help.

So it didn't contribute to it being a shithole

&amp;gt;Hell yeah we supported them at first. We might have pulled away from them later, but we helped put them into power.

Haiti elected him, not us

&amp;gt;Aristide himself claims it was a kidnapping, and the Dominican Republic claims that the US helped train and arm the rebels. Obviously, the US has denied it, but of course they would.

There's no proof we kidnapped him, and even if we did arm/train rebels, we didn't hand them orders and say "go start a coup, we'll be back to pick up the President later"</text>

    <text>It absolutely does, especially if our president is calling it a "shithole". Saying "well other people did it too" is an awful excuse.

We should strive to be the best as a country, not hide behind the defense of "well it happened to others too". Expect more out of our country. </text>
