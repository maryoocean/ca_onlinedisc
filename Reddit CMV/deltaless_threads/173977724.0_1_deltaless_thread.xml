    <title>CMV: I shouldn't get LASEK surgery.</title>
    <original_poster>nazedayo</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't have any current ocular issues (aside from astigmatism). They are L: -9.5, R: -9.0. This means that I can't function without my glasses or contacts– for all intents and purposes I'm blind without them. As an active rock climber and runner, I'd find replacing my contacts (which I hate) convenient, but have my skepticisms.

I've been hesitant to indulge because most LASEK surgeries will cost $2500/eye, according multiple evaluations at 4 different laser surgery centers. My insurance will only pay for 15% (pre-tax $). I'm saving up to go to MBA in about 4 years, and am not sure getting LASEK now would be a wise investment.

I'm also hesitant because I've heard anecdotes from friends who've had LASEK (not LASIK) that, about 2 months~1 year after their surgery, they went from an average 1.0/1.0 back down to about 0.2/0.3 ish. Still pretty damn good, but makes me suspicious about the quality of the treatment.

I've heard that people experience dry eyes constantly, and am afraid that it may imply bigger problems when I get old.

Lastly, I heard LASEK (not LASIK) hurts like a mother the first day or two.

    <text>pain is correct, but what it seems is that you need a good explanation of a doctor, while i could clarify certain things for medical expertise you should never rely on the Internet

    <text>Medically speaking, the doctor has said go for it. Just worried that some doctors might be underselling the point about the declining vision, but other responses on this thread say otherwise– of course taking with a grain of salt</text>

    <text>Remember, doctors are bound by the Hippocratic oath. They aren't there to "undersell" possible side effects, but to give you a fair assessment based on their medical experience and knowledge.  If your doctor is saying "go for it," he/she does not have [**dollar signs for eyes**](http://i.imgur.com/s1nR6cT.jpg); they are recommending surgery because their medical knowledge and experience tells them that the risk of complications is low.  

All we can give you here on Reddit is personal anecdotes and maybe cite a study or two (which may be years old and not take into account recent advances in the technology).  </text>
