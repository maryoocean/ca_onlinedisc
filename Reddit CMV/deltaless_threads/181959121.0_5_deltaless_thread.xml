    <title>CMV: Celebrity AMAs are ruined by Victoria from Reddit</title>
    <original_poster>ithinkimtim</original_poster>
    <original_post>**EDIT: [Please read this from the /r/IAmA  mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/30ea3g/mod_post_riama_misconceptions/)**

----

I have no problem with Victoria herself, just the concept of "Victoria from reddit is here helping me out".

To me the entire point of an AMA is having someone of note interact
with this unpredictable medium.  Ask Me **Anything**.  It's fun and interesting to see them negotiate the comments, with the potential for them to be reading the most bizarre and funny points of view, with strange interactions on lower voted comments as well as random replies to far reaching child-comments.

Victoria from Reddit turns the medium into yet another "send in your questions and we'll pick the best to ask this person who is so much better than you".  Instead of interacting directly with someone, there's a filter.  A filter who types the same way in every AMA, using *italics* and -laughs- and -umms- which completely takes away from it for me.

Here Victoria says that the Woody Harelson AMA would have turned out differently:  https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fgsv2/i_am_victoria_from_reddit_amaa/ck91rpw  Which shows that comments are being filtered.  That is what made AMAs so great, it's a celeb being talked to directly, and this is more often POSITIVE rather than that negative example.

In essence I think Victoria turns it into a basic interview with fan questions that has been done a million times before.  If a brand wants to promote via AMA, jump in and get dirty.   I don't even read AMAs anymore if it's got Victoria doing the typing.

If there's a better way of looking at this , please CMV, I want to enjoy AMAs again without the frustration.

-----
Reason for view change:

I still dislike AMAs with Victoria, and am clearly not the only one.  This comes from Victoria creating a difference between the celebs and us average Joes.  Of course this isn't always the case.  As it turns out, Victoria will help anyone that fits in her schedule.  So in reality it is just some AMAs (Ludacris as a recent example) that may turn out far more interesting if they had to navigate the website themselves in exchange for publicity.

With a few people commenting with first hand experience, I've decided that because the benefits of Victoria are more heavily weighted by the majority, my post title view has been changed.  Even if I'm stuck hating the AMAs, Victoria doesn't "ruin" them.

Thanks for all the replies!

    <text>Without protection from a "Victoria" those celebrities wouldn't do an AMA at all. The whole point is to promote whatever book, movie, charity, project etc. they are working on at the moment. Without a Victoria protecting them, they risk turning a marketing event into a PR nightmare. No one wants to be the next Woody Harrelson. 

Sure, it makes for pretty tame crap, but marketing is the only reason celebrities go on talk shows, do AMA's, or give interviews at all. It's either this or nothing. Remember, Reddit is a business. It is owned by the 44th largest private company in America. It is just as invested in promoting products as any other media outlet. As long as people watch the Tonight Show, read AMA's or flip through People magazine, this is how it's going to be.</text>

    <text>But you have to remember that the USP of the AMA was that it was out of control of the PR team. Just explaining to the OP what point Victoria serves, which he already seems to understand, doesn't constitute much of an argument. </text>

The *questions* are out of control of the PR team, but the PR team can very much be in control of the answers. It's not like we can force celebs to go into a locked room by themselves and answer everything, most celebs' agents would probably recommend or even insist that all the answers be vetted by someone before being posted.</text>

    <text>&amp;gt; reddit Inc. is now owned by Advance Publications (which also owns Condé Nast), so even though the organizational shift is important, reddit is not really going anywhere. 

Are you sure you read that post closely? That is one of the quotes in the link you provided.</text>

    <text>Sorry, wrong link:

http://www.redditblog.com/2013/08/reddit-myth-busters_6.html

Not owned by anyone, but Advance Publications is a big shareholder. From 2006-2011 they were a part of Condè Nast, from 2011-2012, Advance Publications, since 2012, independent.</text>

    <text>Oh, good point. I'm not sure how being the largest shareholder vs. the controlling shareholder influences the day to day, but it's interesting nonetheless. 

I wonder how much of a company do you have to own to say you own the company? If I buy a share of Coke, I wouldn't say I own the company. If I owned 100%, I would say that I owned it. If I owned more than 51%, I'd be the controlling shareholder, but would I be the owner? </text>

  <comment id="27679210220.0" user="kraetos" delta="False">
    <text>If you owned 51% of the company you would be the principle owner, but most owners don't involve themselves in the day-to-day operations of the company, they hire a CEO who knows how to run a company.

There are exceptions, especially for really small companies, but most of the time the owner sits on the board, and the board members are not the company's officers.

So for reddit to say that they aren't "owned" by Advance Publications, Advance Publications must own less than 51% of the company.</text>

    <text>So let me get this perfectly straight.  Reddit is, for the most part, it's own, independent company? </text>

  <comment id="27678921510.0" user="brycedriesenga" delta="False">
    <text>Indeed. I feel like the celebrities that use Victoria wouldn't do it at all if she wasn't there. The celebrities who comment themselves, well, they're cool and we do get some of those. </text>

Good. Having less celebrities and more actual interesting people is the only thing that would get me to resub /r/iama</text>

    <text>If I wanted to watch a tame interview, I would just watch a tame interview. Talk show hosts have the advantage of actually seeing the celebs, so they get better chemistry. If redditors don't interact directly with the interviewee there isn't any point to the AMA. Boring celeb AMAs take front page space from potentially interesting everyday people, and discourages them to post. I'm sure Victoria encouraged some meaningful AMAs, but in general reddit shouldn't be helping celebs get free PR.</text>
