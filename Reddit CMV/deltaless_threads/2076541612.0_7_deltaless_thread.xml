    <title>CMV: Male promiscuity is associated with increased agency in life</title>
    <original_poster>their-holiness</original_poster>
    <original_post>I think straight male promiscuity is associated with an increased agency in life. Being more in control and able to do what you want. I think this is the case because compared to other groups getting into the lifestyle is much more difficult for them. I don't have any view one way or the other on other groups for this topic because I don't see myself as knowing enough about their experiences.

  
I think most people likely disagree with this view which makes me optimistic I'll get to see good arguments against it.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

I think promiscuity essentially has a lower skill floor and a higher skill ceiling compared to monogamy. I'm much more confident about the lower skill floor since I don't exactly know much of the heights of accomplishment for either. I think it requires more social and emotional skills to be continuously promiscuous than to maintain a long-term monogamous relationship (or polyamorous relationships). I think monogamy is generally the easy way out and that's why most men choose it.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

I think promiscuity requires maintaining your health and other things like that a lot more than monogamy, and it requires higher social skills and emotional regulation skills. I think that monogamy requires a narrower range of skills and maintenance, but I'm unsure.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

However, and this is important, my view will be changed if I see evidence suggesting a higher ceiling for monogamy, in that case it would be more like there's a group of highly competent monogamous men distinguished from the lower ones who aren't competent and they deserve to be in their own category which may be equal or higher than the promiscuous men.

EDIT: I messed up my usage of the terms ceiling and floor. Floor is backwards in this post</original_post>

    <text>I think most successful, self-actuating people are monogamous. Not that they're unable to attract people to have affairs with but that they simply have other priorities and better uses for their time. Also better able to maintain a relationship in the first place.

I think the most promiscuous people tend to have the most chaos in their lives. Either due to their own shortcomings or simply because they enjoy the chaos.</text>

    <text>That's an interesting take that it's from priorities outside of sex as opposed to just sex differently. I'll have to think on it, do you think that monogamy is easier but leaves room for other life priorities or do you think it's also more difficult?</text>

    <text>I think having affairs is the most difficult/ time consuming thing, which I think is why people tend to be serial monogamists. Also think monogamy becomes easier than promiscuity as you get older since the pool of available people gets smaller and worse. There's probably a better evo psychology explaination though.</text>
