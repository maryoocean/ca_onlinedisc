    <title>I believe that if Washington can have the Redskins, I can have a team called the Black People. CMV</title>

    <original_post>I feel that many people would be offended if a city had a sports team that was called the [insert city] Black People, or even The Blacks, with their logo being a black man's head. However, people (for the most part) accept the fact that the Washington Redskins have all of those same elements, except with a Native American.

 I know that in the past, and perhaps even currently, there has been a movement to get these Native American team names changed, but as we know, mostly nothing has come of this. I feel like if I made a team whose mascot was a black man, that team would receive such outrage that it would never survive. But if the Redskins can exist, the Black People should also be able to exist. CMV.</original_post>

    <text>The team name "Red Skin" is directed specifically towards an idea, not a race.  Whenever you see any team named after a native American, they are always presented as fictional concepts outside the bounds of contemporary memory.  My rival high school were the "Warriors" - they even had a gigantic mural of a chief with a bloody tomahawk in their gym.  "Warriors" was chosen not because there are some native americans sitting around chilling on reservations today, but rather because it presents an image of ferocity and strength.... Just like the "Fightin' Irish" was chosen in order to portray an image of determination, fidelity and [courage] (http://www3.nd.edu/~wcawley/corson/whyfightingirish.htm)...  
  
My point is that School Mascots are rarely chosen to be taken 100% literally - Should Badgers be worried?  What about Gamecocks?  Or... [Demon Deacons?] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Deacon) Mascots/titles are chosen because of the imagery associated with them - They are supposed to 'intimidate' the competition, evoke such strong emotion that they are easily rallied behind.  
  
These are 100%, absolutely the reasons why "Red Skins" was chosen, instead of "poor Indians," "reservationists," because yes the context matters, and yes in this context it is not Derogatory.</text>
