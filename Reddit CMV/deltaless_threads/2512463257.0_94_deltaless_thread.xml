    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>Banning prayer and hijabs etc is not religiously  neutral, it's promoting atheism. You can't be biased towards one religious viewpoint or try to convert people, it's not fair. It's better to have freedom of religion and let everyone do their own thing. Not pressure people either way, they can pray or not pray. Banning it is oppressive. What's next, punishing people for wearing their yamacas? Putting them in detention? It's a slippery slope to nazism.</text>
