    <title>CMV: Modern marriage in the US brings more harm than benefit for men.</title>
    <original_poster>cannibalstreudel</original_poster>
    <original_post>I believe based on marriage laws and divorce practices that marriage no longer has more benefits than harm for men.

For women it's the opposite. I believe this because whether laws state this or not, practices in divorce court often grant kids' custody to the mother from the father when they aren't more dangerous to their kids than their wife. And often men have to give up half their income/assets in divorce when they often make most of the income of the household.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Sure there are emotional benefits to a long term relationship. But there aren't extra benefits for men on top of an emotionally committed relationship that exclusively comes with marriate.

The security marriage itself brings is only for the woman. She gets to enjoy financial guarantee of sharing income when men often make more than women, and she can be assured of his fidelity - it's backed up by government enforcement... women rarely are punished for fucking another guy and being impregnated at the level men are, and often the man in the marriage gets cucked and is made responsible for raising another man's child.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Men are bringing unnecessary vulnerabilities on themselves when they marry a woman in modern US courts.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

If someone can reliably demonstrate that marriage gives more potential benefit to men than potential harm, I would believe marriage brings more benefit than harm to men. And to be clear, I'm not talking about long term relationships, I'm talking about specifically signing a marriage document and putting the law behind the union.</original_post>

    <text>All of these "drawbacks" are what harms happen in divorce, not in marriage, or are "social consequences".  Essentially, if you ask a person to give up a career to take care of the kids/home while you are married, they gave up future earnings by stopping their employment history.  During this time, the spouse working gets a person at home taking care of everything for free.

As for perks, there are a ton.  Joint filing of taxes (and if one of you isn't working, that will be alot lower.)  Automatic assumption of inheritance on death without a will.  Hospital privledges.  Ability to make medical decisions when the spouse is incapacitated.  There are a ton of small things that really improve the quality of both halves of the married couple when you are legally married.

Quick note: Custody goes to who asks for it, which is usually women.  When contested, it's usually joint custody.

Finally all these biases of "who loses money in x or y situation" are based upon wage, not gender.  Men can get alimony or child support if they were the person at home/person who is looking after the kid.  If anything, your argument is "the person who makes more money, has more to lose in a divorce than the person who made less"</text>

    <text>Got a break at work. Most men make more money and the traditional role has men as the breadwinner. That's a different cmv if we're going to challenge that so if you want to say "breadwinner" in your head, go ahead.
As for the points, feminism has women rejecting the role of keeping things peachy at home, so I'm not guaranteed that at all. If I asked my wife to keep things clean, cook etc I'd be seen as chauvinistic so that's not a benefit in modern marriage unless we agree on it and we can agree on it without a marriage.

The financial obligation of the man (say breadwinner in your head if you like) if the marriage goes sour is reason enough to make marriage a losing proposition.</text>

    <text>&amp;gt; and we can agree on it without a marriage.

Why would a person agree to it without marriage, if they know suddenly you can easily break up with them, and they are up shit creek without a paddle?

I also would appreciate a response to the other two paragraphs you ignored (custody and other benefits)</text>

    <text>Let me turn that around... why would a man agree to marriage if he knows she can take his kids and half his money if she decides to file divorce?

As for your other two paragraphs please link your statistics. I'm challenging the validity of your statement on alimony and custody and I want to see stats.</text>
