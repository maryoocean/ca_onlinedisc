    <title>CMV:It is unreasonable to hold black people to the same intellectual standards as the general population.</title>
    <original_poster>Sky-Jellyfish</original_poster>
    <original_post>[IQ is strongly correlated with school performance, years of education, and job performance.](http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/pdfFiles/IQ_Neisser2.pdf) IQ tests (along with other tests such as the SAT) consistently show African people to be less intelligent. 

["8. The bell curve for whites is centered
roughly around IQ 100; the bell curve for
American blacks roughly around 85;"](https://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997mainstream.pdf)

["The four data sets can be averaged to give an IQ of 68 as the best reading of the IQ in sub-Saharan Africa."](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289609001275)

If attending university or working in upper management in a business requires a high IQ (say one standard deviation above the average or 115) then we should accept that a smaller portion of black people are capable than the general population.

    <text>&amp;gt; then we should accept that a smaller portion of black people are capable than the general population.

So, right now there is an expectation that employers don't exclude anyone from their workplace based on the applicant's race. However, there is no law that you have to have a representative proportion of your employees be black. Employers theoretically just hire the best candidate (unless they're racist/sexist or something). Therefore our workforce currently is operating in accordance with your principle that there are only as many black folks in the workforce as black folks who qualify for their jobs (this applies to anyone, really)

I'd argue a lot of other things about this view, but I think you're suggesting we accept something that is already widely accepted.</text>
