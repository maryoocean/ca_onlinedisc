    <title>CMV: There is no such thing as "love at first sight"</title>

    <original_post>So-called love at first sight is based on just that - sight. 
&amp;amp;nbsp;

Now I know some people are going to jump in with anecdotes about grandparents who married after three dates and were together for 70 years and whatnot. But that is a form of commitment and usually (in older people) a response to a society that did not really allow for divorce. Can two people make it work if they fall in love based on sight and quickly marry? Sure, sometimes. But that doesn't mean that real love, deep love like you have when you know all parts of a person can form immediately upon seeing them. You can't truly love someone without knowing about their personality, their thoughts and their feelings.</original_post>

    <text>If have to agree. I fell in love with how my now girlfriend looked as soon as I saw her, but I didn’t have a clue what kind of person she was. After that I asked her out and the rest is history. So on the one hand you’re really just falling in love with their looks, but on the other it leads to falling in love with them for who they which is far more important. </text>

    <text>Yes now *that* I agree with. You love their *looks* and fall in actual love later. I don't claim to be in love with Zac Effron just because I think he's good looking.</text>
