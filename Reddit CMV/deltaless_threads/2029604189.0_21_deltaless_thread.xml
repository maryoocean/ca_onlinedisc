    <title>CMV: Sustainability, from a philosophical perspective, is misguided</title>
    <original_poster>Pyropeace</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've been an advocate of sustainability for a while. However, I've recently begun to question the underlying assumptions behind the sustainability movement. 

Nothing is truly, infinitely sustainable. The sun will eventually go nova, killing everyone on earth (if humans haven't already gone extinct by then). If humanity manages to escape Earth, then the universe will likely perish as well, depending on what model you accept. The universe is in a constant state of change, and nothing lasts forever. Is it better to be moderately happy for a long period of time or extremely happy for a short period of time? When talking about entire societies, I tend towards the latter, though on an individual basis I tend towards the former. 

Essentially, my question is this; what is the value in things that last a long time in a universe where nothing is eternal?</original_post>

    <text>I mean lets bring things down to personal life scale. There is some very serious scientific predictions that humans don't survive past the 2050's. Like I think phrasing sustainability as something that will effect humans far far into the distant future is a trap. Sustainability like green energy and not letting the planet burn directly impact your future. "the next generation" are you're future caregivers and medical scientists ect.  


Honestly I don't care if humans survive for the next 1,000 years. I care if we survive the next 100, and if we do nothing. Do "as usual" then we won't.  


Before people in the chat call me a doomist or something note I do not society has "been doing nothing." Having this conversation now is proof that people are actively thinking about this issue. And people are activly working on it. This is more of a reason why you personally should care at least a little. Because it doesn't impact just future generations but yours as well. There are selfish reasons to care about the environment. As it turns out, we kind of live on it.</text>
