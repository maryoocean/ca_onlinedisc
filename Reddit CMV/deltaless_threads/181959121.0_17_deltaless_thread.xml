    <title>CMV: Celebrity AMAs are ruined by Victoria from Reddit</title>

    <original_post>**EDIT: [Please read this from the /r/IAmA  mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/30ea3g/mod_post_riama_misconceptions/)**

I have no problem with Victoria herself, just the concept of "Victoria from reddit is here helping me out".

To me the entire point of an AMA is having someone of note interact
with this unpredictable medium.  Ask Me **Anything**.  It's fun and interesting to see them negotiate the comments, with the potential for them to be reading the most bizarre and funny points of view, with strange interactions on lower voted comments as well as random replies to far reaching child-comments.

Victoria from Reddit turns the medium into yet another "send in your questions and we'll pick the best to ask this person who is so much better than you".  Instead of interacting directly with someone, there's a filter.  A filter who types the same way in every AMA, using *italics* and -laughs- and -umms- which completely takes away from it for me.

Here Victoria says that the Woody Harelson AMA would have turned out differently:  https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fgsv2/i_am_victoria_from_reddit_amaa/ck91rpw  Which shows that comments are being filtered.  That is what made AMAs so great, it's a celeb being talked to directly, and this is more often POSITIVE rather than that negative example.

In essence I think Victoria turns it into a basic interview with fan questions that has been done a million times before.  If a brand wants to promote via AMA, jump in and get dirty.   I don't even read AMAs anymore if it's got Victoria doing the typing.

If there's a better way of looking at this , please CMV, I want to enjoy AMAs again without the frustration.

-----
Reason for view change:

I still dislike AMAs with Victoria, and am clearly not the only one.  This comes from Victoria creating a difference between the celebs and us average Joes.  Of course this isn't always the case.  As it turns out, Victoria will help anyone that fits in her schedule.  So in reality it is just some AMAs (Ludacris as a recent example) that may turn out far more interesting if they had to navigate the website themselves in exchange for publicity.

With a few people commenting with first hand experience, I've decided that because the benefits of Victoria are more heavily weighted by the majority, my post title view has been changed.  Even if I'm stuck hating the AMAs, Victoria doesn't "ruin" them.

Thanks for all the replies!

    <text>I mod over at iama. There's a few misconceptions here.  

1) Victoria doesn't pick their questions for them. She does, however, type while they dictate. 

2) She organizes the scheduling and works with their managers and PR people to make them happen

3) she explains the format because iama's interview format is wildly different from anything else on their PR blitz. 

3 is what I think she means by making woody's better. No one really explained the format to him so he was begging to do the familiar answer all the same questions about the current movie media stop. You can avoid a lot of disasters if you give the participant the heads up that they can't force the narrative and if you try, AMAs have some serious teeth to bite you. 

Which leads to - Victoria doesn't whitewash the narrative. It's not really possible. If a popular question or set of questions rises to the top that they avoid, that's the celebrity making a choice, but at least they know ahead of time that tough questions are a distinct possiblity and they ignore them at their own peril.

Forgive any typos. Tablet typing here. </text>

    <text>Further to what /u/OrangeJulius said, a lot of non redditors don't know about reddits in-jokes, they won't know about 100 ducks size horses are or what an "ayy lmao" is. /u/chooter provides context for these to make the iama better</text>
