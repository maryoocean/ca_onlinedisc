    <title>CMV: It's fair to compare carnists (people who eat meat) to nazis.</title>
    <original_poster>Arkenhiem651</original_poster>
    <original_post>1) Carnists think that animals are inferior; Nazis think that jews are inferior
2) Carnists put animals in camps; Nazis put jews in camps
3) Both jews and animals attempt to escape
4) Both are/were normalized. Anyone who goes against these beliefs were/are suppressed and treated as illogical/emotionally driven
5) Both are unnecessary 
6) Both are/were driven long distances and murdered
7) emotional detachment from the victims
8) Both are sentient
Alex Hershaft a holocaust survivor also used this comparison along with other vegan holocaust survivors.
"We're focusing on the victims rather than the cancer of oppression itself",[8] and that "I noted with horror the striking similarities between what the Nazis did to my family and my people, and what we do to animals we raise for food: the branding or tattooing of serial numbers to identify victims, the use of cattle cars to transport victims to their death, the crowded housing of victims in wood crates, the arbitrary designation of who lives and who dies — the Christian lives, the Jew dies; the dog lives, the pig dies."[6

Also Alex Hershshaft looks extremely young considering he's 88 and survived concentration camps. That's irrelevant but I thought it interesting enough to mention considering he claims it's due to his vegan diet.

Edit: I know I say Jews but this also applies to other victims of the concentration camps such as Slavic peoples, gays and communists</original_post>

    <text>You can compare everything to everything. I am pretty sure that you at one point your life wore an article of clothing that is similar in colour to something that Hitler wore. That does not make you Nazi. Your point 5. says that both carnists and Nazis are not necessary, but it is also unnecessary for you to make this post on Reddit. Again, that does not make you Nazi.

So, you list comparisons, but what is your argument that these equal comparisons make these two things the equivalent. You've listed similar *details*, but to these details entail that they are similar in *principle.*</text>

    <text>They are the same in principle because they are both unnecessary mass slaughter of sentient beings driven by ignorance.</text>

    <text>Meat eating is necessary in some part of the world though, at least if you're not on a substantial budget.   
Besides animals arent generally slaughtered for some idealogical goal they're slaughtered for profit or out of hunger</text>

    <text>So if someone is starving to death and they caught and ate a fish you'd say that they're basically a cannibal nazi?</text>

    <text>No, Nazis were driven by fear. Carnivores are driven by hunger.</text>
