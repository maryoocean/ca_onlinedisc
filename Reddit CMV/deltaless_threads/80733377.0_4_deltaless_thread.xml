    <title>I think that welfare recipients should endure random drug testing as a condition of receiving benefits. CMV.</title>

    <original_post>99% of jobs I've held have required drug screening at random or as an initial condition of employment.  I think that all adults who receive welfare should be subjected to the same screening process.  This should be a federal addendum to all state welfare programs.</original_post>
