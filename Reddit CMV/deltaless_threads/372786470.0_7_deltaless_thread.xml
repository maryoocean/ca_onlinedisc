    <title>CMV: Kids today are losing the ability to express themselves effectively</title>

    <original_post>Since writing is an important tool of communication it is important to learn the process without the help of paraphrasing from the writings of others and arriving at ideas naturally. most kids don't write using their own ideas, they search the internet and arrange the writings of other people into an essay. The effect of this method of writing papers is harmful because if they don't arrive at ideas naturally and write them in their own words they will not be able to write or know proper grammar without the help of technology. </original_post>

    <text>I agree, but you have to fit into the parameters of what is deemed passable. Sometimes I'm not thinking inside the box, and there were times in writing class that I wrote about "bad" things from the point of a "bad person." 

So when given the topic to write freely, I wrote about drug abuse because I had just got done watching some show about it. And because I wrote it like a diary entry, my parents recieced a phone call.

That just taught me to "stay within the lines." So when I moved on to college English courses, I did the same exact thing you said. And always passed. English got so easy to me I never struggled at all with it and I just "adopted" the style and tone of a fancy writer and would pass every time. 

Never got anything lower than a B. And that B was because I waited  on the end of semester paper till the night before.</text>
