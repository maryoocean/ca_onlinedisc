    <title>CMV: The notion that the Democrats or Republicans "must" run Biden or Trump "because there are no other viable candidates" is ridiculous. There are thousands of people who would make better presidential candidates for 2024 than Biden or Trump.</title>

    <original_post>Every argument for Biden or Trump to run in 2024 boils down to some version of "status quo" or "inertia." We're told that the Ds and Rs have no choice but to run these super-old candidates because there's nobody else who could be suitable.

&amp;#x200B;

In a nation of 332,000,000 people, there are well over 100 million who are over the age of 35, American-born, and have resided in the United States for 14 years or more - in other words, are constitutionally eligible to run for president.

Out of those 100 million, surely at least half have a basic education, are mature, sensible, decent people, and have demonstrated solid character - and also be significantly younger than Trump or Biden.

Out of those 50 million, surely at least ten million would qualify as *highly* educated - the metrics of which can be tricky to figure out (is it a master's degree? or something else?) - but they would be significantly above average.

Out of those 10 million, surely at least one million would be quite exceptional - people who have substantially high IQ, have advanced quite far in life and a career - such as being a doctor, or having worked in public governmental service for decades, etc.

And out of those million, surely at least 10,000 would have the political know-how, the charisma, the political interest, maybe have spent significant time abroad in foreign countries or speak multiple languages, to be a suitable president.

In fact, even in Congress, state legislatures or governorships alone, there must be dozens of good, qualified, educated, experienced politicians who would be much younger than Trump or Biden, and who would make suitable presidential candidates. 

So, CMV on this one. I don't buy for one moment the notion that, in a nation of 332 million people, America somehow has no choice but to run Biden vs. Trump in 2024 because "we've got no one else who'd be a good candidate."  </original_post>

    <text>We all know that there are a fair number of people out there who would make good presidents. Hardly anybody is making that claim.  

Joe Biden is the incumbent president and wants to run - there's no good scenario for the DNC or any other major Democratic group to back someone else.  But there are other Democrats running against him, they're just not going to do very well.  Nobody with a major following or future wants to run against him, either because they care about the country and think doing so would hurt the Dems' chances, or they care about their own political future and think doing so would hurt their own political fortunes, or both.  

And this: "And nothing short of imprisonment or death will convince the RNC to run anyone other than Trump" is just straight false.  There are 6 other candidates currently running for the Republican nomination, and there were 6 other major candidates who have already dropped out due to lack of support from voters and donors. 

They will just likely lose because Trump is more popular with his base.</text>
