    <title>I find that atheists are devoid of compassion for humanity. CMV</title>

    <original_post>When I was a Christian, I found there were assholes mostly but there also seemed to be a profound desire to do good. And when it did happen, it was so fucking relieving. 

I have been an agnostic for some time now. But I feel that people are not very compassionate. They are judgment and form emotional cliques. So their entire moral compass is based on protecting these loved ones and attacking those who 'step out of line?' On top of that, many atheists that I have met are often pretty petty about their ideas and, if something sounds slightly off or 'wrong', they try and shut you down immediately instead of listening. They seem to be completely legalistic.

Is there an humanist or atheist 'philosophy' out there that promote compassion for other people?</original_post>

    <text>I think that in the strictest sense, an atheist mentality promotes the thought that all we have is each other to rely on. If there is no God to save us, then we have to save each other.

However, a blanket generalization will always, always be wrong because exceptions are inevitable. Any individual's experience of the world is prone to bias. Unless you asked every person you met about their religious stance, you can't know if atheists or religious people actually have tendencies towards compassion or indifference; you can only make judgements about the people who tell you their beliefs.

/r/Philosophy and /r/askanatheist might both be good for asking more questions.</text>
