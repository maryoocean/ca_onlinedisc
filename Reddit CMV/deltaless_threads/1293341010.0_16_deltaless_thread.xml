    <title>CMV: Every Disney Princess could be reasonably interpreted as a metaphor for mental illness or diagnosed as having one</title>
    <original_poster>DaisyChained23</original_poster>
    <original_post>Examples:

Belle- Stockholm Syndrome. Also maybe NPD (the scene where the villages are singing about how beautiful and special she is could be seen as a grandiose delusion).

Rapunzel - Anxiety (her "tower" is a mental one) and PTSD from an abusive mother.

Elsa and Anna- BPD. Anna is impulsive and reckless and doesn't really have a clear sense of identity. Elsa is impulsive in a different way and cold. They could be seen as two sides of "splitting".

Ariel- body dysphoria. She literally changes the entire lower half of her body.</original_post>

    <text>Any trait or behavior, used as a “metaphor” for the extreme of that behavior, represents a personality disorder. That’s what a personality disorder *is*; an extreme of an otherwise normal behavior (repeated a lot). You might as well say that women having personalities could be reasonably interpreted as a metaphor for mental illness. 

That said, Snow White is definitely totally bonkers. ;-P</text>
