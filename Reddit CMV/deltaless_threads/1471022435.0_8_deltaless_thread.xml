    <title>CMV: In Breaking Bad, there are some serious Meth Math problems with Walter and Jessie's 3 month job working for Gus</title>
    <original_poster>RedditExplorer89</original_poster>
    <original_post>1.) They are making 200 pounds of meth a week for 3 months.  (source: The show)

2.) The meth sells at $40 an ounce. (Source:

Jessie keeps saying, "He's selling at 40 a pound".  I see 3 possibilities for this:

A.) He mean $40 a pound.  For all the risk they are taking to make Meth, that seems like too small of revenue.

B.) Me meant $40,000 a pound.  This sounds like astronomically too high.  How could Meth junkies ever afford their meth if 1 pound sells for 1 years minimum wage salary?

C.) He mis-poke, and meant $40 an ounce.  This sounds most plausible to me, as it means they are making some decent money from their risk and Meth junkies can still afford to buy their meth.)

3.) There are 16 ounces in a pound. (Source: [Google](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;amp;q=ounces+in+a+pound))

4.) They are working for 13 weeks.  (Source:

Assuming ~31 days in a month, ~31 x 3 = ~93 days in 3 months.  ~93/7 = ~13 weeks in 3 months)

5.)  Conclusion: The meth they make for Gus during the 3 months can sell for ~1.5 million dollars.  (Source:

$40 (per ounce) x 16 (ounces per pound) x 200 (pounds per week) x 13 (weeks in the job) = $1,664,000, or ~1.5 million dollars)

Now lets get down to the problems here:

**Gus is losing money**

Gus is paying 3 million dollars for these two guys to make product that he will sell for 1.5 million dollars.  That's 1.5 million dollars down the drain.

**Walter and Jessie are bad at Math**

Jessie and Walter both come to the conclusion that Gus is making 93 million off their 3 month job.  Given all the information we have, they should have come to 1.5 million.  Jessie I could understand making a mistake somewhere in this math.  But Walter is supposed to be the smart guy.  How could he also make this mistake?

**What would change my view**:

1.) Show me a way to interpret the information in the show in such a way that the job is profitable for Gus while still being based in reality.

2.) Explain why both Walter and Jessie made such bad math mistakes in their calculations.

Bonus points if you can do both.

**What wouldn't change my view**

*This was a mistake the show-writers made.*  If this is the case I apologize since it means there isn't really a view to be changed here.  However, I have hope that there is something I am missing that explains this mess.

Edits/deltas:

* Gus is doing this venture as a long term plan.  Once he has Walt's formula, he can start making money again.

* The math at $40k a pound checks out for Walter and Jessie's calculation if you assume 12 weeks instead of 13 weeks.  12 instead of 13 weeks seems like a simple enough mistake if you assume the 4 weeks per month as many people do.  $40k a pound for meth seems unrealistic to me, but at least that is a flaw in the world building rather than Walter or Jessie's character.

* Junkies buy in teenths (1/16 of an ounce), which makes selling Meth at $40k a pound more reasonable.  Also, $40k a pound checks out with how much money Walter and Jessie were making when they cooked in their RV.

* Real Meth sells at about the $40k per pound value.  Looks like the show was actually being very realistic after all!</original_post>

    <text>&amp;gt; 2.) The meth sells at $40 an ounce.

That is very very wrong. An ounce is 28.35 grams, so you're saying $1.40 per gram. That's way, way too low.

Jesse means 40 grand. Forty thousand dollars per pound.

- One pound = 454 grams
- 40000/454= $88 per gram
- That's easily within a realistic ballpark.

At 40k/pound:
- 200x40,000 = 8000,000
- That's eight million dollars per week.

Not the most up to date source, but here's a DEA report from 1993:\
https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/150360NCJRS.pdf\
If you scroll to the executive summary (or just find in page for "pound"), it claims wholesale prices for meth (in the early 90s) are $5000-$22,000 per pound.

Drug prices vary significantly, at different market levels (wholesale, street, etc.), and geographically - around the US and around the world. The bottom line though is that your calculations are based on a very incorrect assumption about the sale price.</text>

    <text>Well said and well sourced.  I do believe now that I was very off with that assumption.  Already gave a delta for this though.</text>
