    <title>CMV: It's stupid to care about the environment in space.</title>
    <original_poster>MostRecommendation84</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm a big proponent of space colonization/exploitation and every time I bring it up there's someone who says something along the lines of "Oh we're gonna trash the Moon like we did Earth?" "Oh good more mining!" "Humanity won't rest until we've exploited everything we can!" and other snide comments to that effect. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Honestly, it just sounds like the dumbest argument to me and I wouldn't even be bothering with a CMV if I hadn't heard it so many times. *It's rocks. Uninhabitable barren rocks floating through vast chunks of literally* ***nothing****.* There's no space squirrels to worry about, we haven't found any aliens and we really have no reason to assume any are out there, let alone that they give a shit what we do to Mercury. Furthermore, you want to stop desertification or the human rights violations of cobalt mining, you're gonna be hard pressed to find a better solution than the absurd volumes of water and cobalt from here to the asteroid belt.</original_post>

    <text>1. Space junk in orbit will cause problems for future space missions, especially if it collides and begins to fragment.

2. Bio contamination from space junk on other worlds will make the surch for extraterrestrial life significantly more difficult, especially if life turns out to have very strict functional criteria, such as has to use dna or specific molecular chiralitys. 
If we find evidence of life on say mars we would want to know if it evolved independently or if we are related. Having bugs from say a space testla surviving on mars would make that goal significantly more difficult.

3. More a super long time scale plan but we dont want to launch all earths recorces off in to the universe as space junk. Space is so big we may have to view the solar system as a closed system.

Don't forget we are at the beginning of the space age and exponential growth is a bitch for making small problems massive in no time!</text>
