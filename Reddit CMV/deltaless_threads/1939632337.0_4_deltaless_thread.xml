    <title>cmv: Triscuits are the best crackers</title>
    <original_poster>Cooltific</original_poster>
    <original_post>Triscuits are simply superior to those other “crackers”. Wheat Thins, Ritz, Saltines, Goldfish, Chicken Biscuits, Graham Crackers, etc are all inherently incapable of matching the greatness that is the Triscuit. Think only to this fine cracker’s taste and texture: A strong mix of stringed wheat along with various subtle flavors ranging from garlic to tomato w olive oil to Gouda cheese. It would seem absurd to me to think there’s anything that matches this ALPHA/S-Tier cracker’s obvious dominance in the snack hierarchy! I haven’t even mentioned how well it mixes with meat and cheese. Salami + Sharp White Cheddar + Triscuit is PRETTY good I’ll say! 

(I’m sure this subreddit can appreciate a light and humorous post… And yes I do see triscuits this way.)</original_post>

    <text>They're the best cracker you can eat by itself. 

The texture and Wheaty flavor provide a better experience than some boring ass regular cracker. 

If you want to somehow utilize a cracker? Triscuit doesn't hold up, with very few exceptions. 

Dip a triscuit in chicken salad, eat it, and then look me in my face and try to tell me it's enjoyable.(whereas the regular cracker is superb with chicken salad)</text>

    <text>Honestly Triscuits don’t always blend well with certain foods. I do think they’re quite good with cheese, but I haven’t experimented enough with them to reach a broad conclusion.</text>
