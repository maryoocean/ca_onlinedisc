    <title>CMV: The onus of sustainability is excessively placed on consumers and the obligation should instead be placed on corporations.</title>
    <original_poster>Fluffy_Owl4316</original_poster>
    <original_post>Much of the media we read today about sustainability is focused on what consumers should be doing to move the needle. This includes things such as recycling food containers, composting food scraps, repairing and reusing clothing rather than purchasing new, etc. As corporations continue to produce these items, the proper disposal and thus environmental impact, is placed on the consumer. 

On the other hand, corporations are publishing lofty goals about recycled materials and reduced carbon footprint by 2050 or other far-off timeframes. Yet, there is little regulation to ensure that these goals are achieved. There isn’t a single governing body which is responsible for measuring the attainment of these statements, which doesn’t hinder the goodwill of creating the goals, but does little to hold corporations accountable for achieving them. 

At the end of the day, large corporations are responsible for much of the waste which harms the environment and should have a greater obligation and more enforcement of sustainable methods and materials. While end users are also responsible, humans fall victim to common errors and shortcomings which make true environmental impact, one that moves the needle, nearly impossible for individual users, even collectively as compared to large businesses. While the responsibility for sustainability and carbon footprint is often targeted towards consumers, the narrative should instead be on large corporations and how to hold them accountable to finding sustainable solutions.</original_post>

    <text>It is worth noting that “big corporations” are partially interested in sustainability. I mean if for example some retail chain would figure out a way to spend less gasoline by improving their logistics structure, they would totally do it and the carbon imprint will become lower and everyone will win. 

The main problem then is that there are some resources that corporations might use but not pay for them. For example they may use some river to dump waste in it and if there are no laws forbidding it, it’s free. 

So my point is that we should focus on pricing all the externalities and the more of them are priced, the more big corporations with sustainable strategies will win in the market.

All in all that means that in my opinion the obligation should be placed more on the lawmakers.</text>
