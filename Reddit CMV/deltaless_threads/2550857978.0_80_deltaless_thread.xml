    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>Makes me sad that posts need to be made like this. The problem with society based upon race, is that when someone within a group of people does something bad, then the entire group is inherently bad under the thought process of others.

That thinking is wrong. It's like saying if a student hurts another student in one of their classes, then every student within the school is bad.

I'm met more kind cops than I've ever met bad cops, and I've never met a bad cop once in my life. When you say that exact thing in public, someone who believes that ACAB thing will try to pull a fast one and bring up a New York Times article by a politically and socially biased author that talks about abolishing the police.</text>
