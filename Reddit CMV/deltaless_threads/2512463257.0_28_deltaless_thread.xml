    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>1. Secular means neutral or unrelated to religion. A secular institution doesn't need to ban expression of religion inside of it, just like how a public institution doesn't need to ban every privately-owned store or good inside of it (which would be silly).

2. By enforcing the absence of religion, you're implicitly forcing the institution to become atheist. Why is atheism a more valid belief to enforce on people than any other? (speaking as an atheist myself)

3. Should expressions of any belief system to banned as well? If not, why is religion any different from other belief systems (assuming that the person practicing isn't harming anyone else)? If so, should we ban all expressions of politics inside school as well? What about banning people expressing their favorite music artists? etc.</text>
