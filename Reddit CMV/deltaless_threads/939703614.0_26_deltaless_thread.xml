    <title>CMV: Where your born doesn't matter and country pride is pointless</title>
    <original_poster>Blank-VII</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't think I belong to a country and I think the concept is odd. I was born in the UK and have lived here all my life, but I fail to understand why people are so hard-core about being a 'proud brit' or anything. Where I was born isn't something I was able to decide for myself, and I want my life to be what I make out of it, not what it decides for me. I believe the only way to belong to a country is to find one whose culture is similar to your own tastes and opinions, and to move there. What's the point in being proud of a country I was born in if I feel no attachment to how it's run or anything else?

*you're

*View partially changed. Country pride is not pointless.

**Main view unchanged, it seems no-one can quite convince me. I've had some fantastic conversations and I'm really happy with how many of you engaged without being toxic. Stay safe y'all. Thanks so much!**</original_post>

    <text>Even if you argue for this from a principle-based position, people typically want a sense of belonging to... something, someone, somewhere. People have various levels of intimacy and care for various groups and individuals. 

&amp;gt;  I fail to understand why people are so hard-core about being a 'proud brit' or anything

People commonly value their family, spouse, children above all else. Next comes best friends, friends, colleagues maybe... strangers... and then there are people you outright dislike. But why be so exclusionary? Are there particularly good ethical/moral reasons to treat your family as though they are more valuable than others? Almost everybody is part of a family.

E.g. if you have to pick between saving a family member or someone else's family member, are there any valid philosophical or ethical reasons to favour one over the other? Perhaps not. But most people would still favour choosing their relative over some random person, despite total recognition that this is in no way a superior decision.

You can then extend this to less intimate groupings, such as nationalities. And people tend to feel a sense of kinship especially when they have a shared opposite, if not enemy; it's easy to feel some kind of *shared achievement* in finding something to unite over. Like how supporters of some sports team have a celebration when their team wins.

Imagine if aliens popped up. We'd all be proud of being humans.

Imagine if our world had only one continent and then another one popped up. We'd be proud just for being from our own.

Imagine if you're in like, one out of two major cities in your country. There's already a rivalry due to sports teams most likely, and then many other city teams pop up. It's an easy way to feel association with a competition.
