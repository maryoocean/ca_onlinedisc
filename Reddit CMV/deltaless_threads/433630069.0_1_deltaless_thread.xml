    <title>CMV: I should be able to sell my organs</title>
    <original_poster>stupidrobots</original_poster>
    <original_post>In short I should receive adequate compensation during life for use of my organs after my death.  The goal of this is to provide a financial incentive to increase the supply (and thus reduce cost) of organs required for transplant.  The benefits I see are as follows:

1) it gives the poor and disadvantaged a way to make money and get on their feet without requiring higher education or years of experience, relieving debts.

2) The financial incentive gives people reason to donate organs who might otherwise not.  This increases supply and drives down cost, and reduces time on waiting lists.  

3) A profitable program of organ collection would allow advertising for agencies that do this service and write up contracts, increasing the visibility of the needs of people who require organ transplants.

4) The argument that this creates a black market for organs is silly.  If someone wanted to kill you and take your organs, laws against it won't really help because now we're talking about maniacs.  

Furthermore my organs are my property, and I get to say what happens to my property during my lifetime and at the time of my death.  To deny this is to deny that individuals have the right to their own bodies.

    <text>Just to clarify, are you talking about selling organs now, or only after you are dead?</text>

    <text>Organs are really only worth something if you are young and healthy. Most of us will grow old and die, and our organs won’t be much use then.  An 80 year old kidney or heart isn’t a great donation source.

Because of that, you’d only get paid a very small sum, because the chances are pretty good they will be useless.</text>

    <text>Ok, and how is it not my right to take that money if it's offered?</text>
