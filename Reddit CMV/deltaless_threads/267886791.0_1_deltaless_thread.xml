    <title>CMV: Actively encouraging everyone to vote is overall harmful to a democratic society.</title>
    <original_poster>The_Law_of_Pizza</original_poster>
    <original_post>I would like to start off by clarifying that I do not support voter suppression, poll taxes, poll tests, or restrictions on voting rights in any form. I even disapprove of removing felons' rights to vote.

That said, I reject those things not because I believe broadening the voter pool benefits society, but because such restrictions are far too dangerous to allow people to meddle with. The temptation by those in power to restrict the rights of voters who disagree with them is too much for people to resist, so as a necessary evil we must prohibit such meddling in any way.

More to the point, though, I believe that actively encouraging *everyone* to vote is the other side of that same coin - it is rounding up reactionary, low information voters to vote for your position on an issue. It warps democracy from being about a collective process to discuss and decide policy, into a competition to see who can bus the most warm bodies to the polls.

Voting is a right, but it is also a responsibility. Voting without being informed is an abuse of that responsibility, and encouraging uninformed voters to go to the polls is aiding in that abuse for your own political benefit.

A democratic society functions best when the voters are rational and informed. They (ideally) learn what they can about any issue, make a subjective decision based on their internal values, and then vote for a candidate or proposal that they believe will best accomplish that. 

While obviously not always true, the people who make a point to go out and vote on their own tend to be the ones who actually care enough to put the time and effort into the process as described in my previous paragraph. They're the closest we get in reality, anyway.

Deliberately rounding up non-voters and pushing them towards the polls dredges up the opposite - low information, reactionary voters whose only knowledge on the issues likely comes from the partisan individuals who gave them the voter registration sheet. They seldom take the time to seek out the other side and hear their version of the story.

So, while these people have every right to vote, they're abusing that right and partisan organizations designed to "get out the vote" are complicit in that. They're harming the overall system for their own gain.

Change my view.</original_post>

    <text>I only disagree because quite frankly, the opposite tends to be true. The people who vote tend to be very radical and while they have very strong beliefs, they don't have facts to back them up. Meanwhile, more sane and moderate people have a very cynical outlook on the election and tend to not bother with it, thinking that they can't change anything.</text>

    <text>I suppose we're at a brick wall then, unless one of us can establish that self-motivated voters tend to be either 1) radical crazies, or 2) informed citizens.

I will admit that there are a number of radical crazies among self-motivated voters, I just don't think they're the majority.

    <text>Would you say that primary voters are more self-motivated than general election voters? Or do you think the opposite is true?</text>

    <text>I would assume that they tend to be more self motivated, although I think they also tend to be more extreme in their underlying values.

But I am deliberately not trying to pass judgment on any particular political values - i.e. something can be factually or logically wrong, but if the person who reached that conclusion genuinely put a good faith effort into researching the issue and coming to their own conclusion, I still consider them to be a self motivated, responsible voter.</text>

    <text>This would have to be a more fact-based research question as we can't both be right... Lol. 

I would argue at the very least, that radicals are a small enough minority of the population that forcing everyone to vote would offset the radical vote.</text>
