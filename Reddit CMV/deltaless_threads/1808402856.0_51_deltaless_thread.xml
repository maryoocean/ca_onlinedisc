    <title>CMV: Fredom of speech is far more important than a few people being offended</title>
    <original_poster>brbrWh0r3</original_poster>
    <original_post>Freedom of speech should be protected and kept, there shouldn't be people arrested for anti trans comments or insulting a soldier/soldiers, or for nazi jokes, or racist remarks or jokes.

Those should all be handled between people, if someone says stuff you dont like you handle it, simply block them or avoid them, theres a whole world you can be in and that persons in a very tiny part of it. 

It makes me nervous seeing people arrested and charged for saying things. It's only leading us to a place where we can be arrested for saying whatever the government doesnt like. And they shouldn't be in that much power to effect our communication with eachother. 

I live in scotland and dont feel I have freedom of speech anymore. 

(For the record I'm a white woman who's bi and have trans thoughts ig for those folks who say it never has been about me, it has sometimes, and in more ways than just those)

Edit: No it's not just anti trans people, Yes I believe crimes other than hate crimes involving speech should be illegal (threatening violence, doxing, defamation) but I also believe insults, jokes and bad takes or thoughts should not be.

Edit 2: Consequences for what is said like losing a job, getting insulted, losing friends ect is totally fine I just dont think the Government should be in charge of what can get you arrested in this sence.

Edit 3: I live in SCOTLAND in the UNITED KINGDOM or in BRITAIN depending what you say, I'm not american, im also not here advocating for my right to be a dick, im just saying the government arent the ones I want saying what I cant say, I mean twitter can destroy lives without them anyway.</original_post>

    <text>So after all your edits (which were all SUPER IMPORTANT info to your argument) it sounds like your real problem is that Scottish law is poorly defined. More specifically, that Hate Crime is poorly defined.

That's a valid, but very different point.

We need very clear, well thought out boundaries between illegal and legally free speech, for sure. But "freedom of speech is far more important than a few people being offended" is a totally different thing- that's claiming that there should be NO illegal speech, that speech cannot EVER be a hate crime.

Which simply isn't how it works. Once a government has decided that it can police some speech (and yes, that includes literal specific threats of violence, since that's still just words), then you are past freedom of speech as a universal. You are now in the realm of "what speech is free" and defining very clearly what is not.

Law does not exist in absolutes, it exists in every more specific lines and boundaries. It's the gray areas where we test ourselves.</text>
