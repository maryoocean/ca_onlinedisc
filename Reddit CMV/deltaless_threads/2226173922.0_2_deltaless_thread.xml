    <title>CMV: Human Reliance is the Greatest Bottleneck to Individual Freedom</title>
    <original_poster>GenoHuman</original_poster>
    <original_post>Human reliance is one of the greatest bottlenecks to individual freedom, as it places limitations on the choices and actions individuals can make. This is because people require time and salary to produce the things they need or want, which can restrict their ability to express themselves and experience life to the fullest. AI on the other hand can rid us of these limitations and produce things for us quickly and cheaply.

A modern example of this is AI art, most artists dislike this idea but there is no denying that millions (or even billons) of people now have the capability to produce art to their own liking (to varying degrees) that would never have been possible before. Another example is [Elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io/) that can copy and recreate perfect human voices from a single minute of audio sample. This allow me as an individual to listen to a voice that I like and create new content with it that would not have been possible before.

I think there is this idea going around that things cannot be of high quality or worthwhile if it didn’t take a lot of effort to produce but this is a human thing and even then it isn’t always true either. A lot of our products are made quick and cheap by machines that we still enjoy regardless.  The conclusion to all of this is that the more automation you have the greater our individual freedom is to express ourselves and experience new things in life and it ought to expand into most if not every part of society when the time is right so we can produce anything we desire ourselves be it videogames, movies, music, conversations, voices, applications and so forth.</original_post>

Except the more that automation pushes people out of jobs, the harder it is to have the money and resources to "produce anything we desire".  Tough to be an artist with expensive materials to buy when you can't even afford groceries.</text>

    <text>Yes but this is not an issue of AI and automation but with the underlying economical system that is capitalism. What I'm suggesting is only highlighting this unsustainable foundation which clearly must make way for a more efficient economical system that benefit and provide for the collective rather than the wealthy few.</text>

    <text>My claim was that having to rely on other people is one of the greatest limits to our individual freedom, that's all. You are arguing against our current economical model, not my claim.</text>

I disagree.

If I didn't have other people to rely on, my life would be an endless endeavor to grow and hunt food, find shelter, fashion protective clothing, perform healthcare tasks, and generally stay alive.  

Relying on others is what *allows* me the freedom to pursue things I desire.  Precisely the opposite of your claim.</text>

    <text>Yes but you are neglecting the basis for my argument which is AI and automation. My claim is that you replace those people with machines and AI to produce for us be it food, shelter or entertainment, right?</text>

And then we lose our jobs and can't afford to pursue pleasurable nonessential hobbies, which is going back to "isn't this just a huge hypothetical"?  And the answer is back to being "yes, this is a huge hypothetical, because that is not the way the world operates".  Your view is not grounded in reality.</text>

    <text>Losing our jobs is a desirable outcome because at a certain point the system will change as a consequence, this is the way forward.</text>

Will it?  How do you know?  And what evidence do you have that the system will change as a result?  Right now one of the two major political parties in the US is trying to make it HARDER to retire.  What could possibly make you think "the system will change" for the better?  

And unless the change is literally overnight, what happens to everyone living paycheck to paycheck who lose their jobs?  Can't afford rent, can't afford food, can't afford transportation, can't afford medical bills.  Unless the entire system changes literally overnight, this is what happens to many people when they lose their jobs.  What's desirable about that?</text>

    <text>My perspective on this is that automation is marching on and we will be out of jobs eventually. The most positive outcome is that we lose our jobs quickly and in mass and through the large backlash against the government the system changes and we recieve some form of UBI. The reason your two parties are trying to make it harder to retire is because 1. we don't have sufficient automation and 2. you have capitalism which says you must increase profits year by year, we don't work because it's a necessity, we work for works sake. 

If it only replaces a few people at a time then yes they might suffer as a consequence as they wait for even more people to be replaced.</text>

    <text>I'd assume the capitalist model continues and then we'd just have way more jobless and homeless folks cause the companies would rather pay maintenance on machines rather than pay for salaries</text>

    <text>This is exactly what would happen.  OP just can't admit they're wrong and that their idealism and optimism is not based in any reality that we live in.</text>
