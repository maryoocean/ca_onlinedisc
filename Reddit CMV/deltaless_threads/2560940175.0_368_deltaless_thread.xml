    <title>cmv: There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as an “American”</title>

    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>You can only be a citizen of a government.  Thus, even if you live in North America, you're not a \*citizen\* of North America, you can be a resident or something like that, but not a citizen.  You \*can\* be a citizen of a country.  Canadians are citizens of Canada, and Americans are citizens of the United States of America.

People living in South America \*could\* call themselves Americans if they want, but they \*cannot\* call themselves American citizens, and when referring to nationality, that is all about citizenship, not about where you happen to reside.

This whole topic is the result of a bunch of logic-twisting BS and a healthy does of envy (as in, the people who came up with it are trying to fan the envy of others).</text>
