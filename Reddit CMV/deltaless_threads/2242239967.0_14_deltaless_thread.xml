    <title>CMV: Religion is just Peer Pressure from Your Parents</title>
    <original_poster>siddharth_pillai</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't think most people believe in their religion. Nor do they believe in the gods they worship. They simply believe in whatever their parents believe. If you're a theist reading this, ask yourself whether you'd still follow your current religion if your parents were Islamic?

You can speculate yourself, don't you think its more likely that you would be Islamic too? If your parents were Hindus, wouldn't you be a Hindu? If your great grandparents were Sikhs wouldn't your parents and in turn you also be a Sikh?

It may not be true for all but its true for an overwhelming majority of people.

Edit: I'm getting some answers asking about people who convert or have non religious parents, my views don't apply to these people</original_post>

    <text>I disagree, my mother is the same religion as me and my father comes from a religious background but is atheist. I strongly believe in god and I pray every day, even if my parents weren't religious I would still believe in god. I have friends who are atheists but I still believe in god and I'm proud of it.

Edit: I was also never forced to believe in any religion, my family did teach me things about my religion and did take me to church but never forved me. I still chose my path to be religious so I completely disagree with you.</text>
