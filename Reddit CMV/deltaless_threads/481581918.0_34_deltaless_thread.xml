    <title>CMV: If I'm not guilty, I want to be tried by a judge rather than a jury</title>
    <original_poster>Mimshot</original_poster>
    <original_post>In the American criminal justice system you have the *right* to a jury trial, but you are not obligated to exercise your right a jury. It's possible to have what's known as a "bench trial" where in addition to determining the admissibility of evidence, and sentencing if convicted, the judge determines guilt or innocence as well.

Jury trials are notoriously unpredictable, therefore if I'm actually not guilty of a crime, I want a professional judging my case. Historically, bench trials result in acquittals [more often than from juries](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/judge_v_judge). I understand wanting to be judged by someone who never saw inadmissible evidence, if I'm guilty but the evidence was illegally obtained, but if I'm actually not guilty, why should I take a chance with a jury?

Change my view.

    <text>One statistical challenge of the evidence you present is that the choice of Judge or Jury is made by the defense team for the best odds of the defense.  This creates a specific sort of statistical bias in the data that is unquantifiable with raw gross success rates.  

For instance, let's assume that 50% of all innocent accussed who go to trial have a large list of character assassinations within the evidence which wouldn't play well with a general population jury.  If all of them instead choose a judge trial because of the nature of their cases and the assumed idea that Judges are more impartial, this would have a *MASSSIVE* affect on raw success rates.

Now, I'm not generally familiar with the actual data within this choice, so I was merely speaking hypothetically, but I *AM* familiar with the statistical selection bias I was describing, and it is very real, very common, and has an unknown effect on the data.</text>
