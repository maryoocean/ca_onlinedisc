    <title>META: Clarifying our stance on "Trojan Horse" CMVs</title>
    <original_poster>Poo-et</original_poster>
    <original_post>There has been uptick somewhat recently of posts where OP makes a claim that they do not believe in order to make a thinly veiled attack on something else entirely. This is usually done to illustrate a double standard they feel a certain group has. We would like to remind all posters of rule B which states *"You must personally hold the view"* and say that going forward we will be removing these posts on sight where they appear.  

These "trojan" posts are not suited to CMV because defeating the claim rarely results in a delta and merely unlocks the real view. There's also a lot of marginal rule 3 content that goes in the comment sections which probably should be avoided. I would advise posters to simply report and move on when you see one of these posts.  

You can talk about double standards in your CMV post, but you must make the positive claim you really believe in as part of that. 

If you have questions or more suggestions for the subreddit, I recommend forwarding them to r/ideasforcmv which the mod team is very active on.  

Thanks for making this place cool.</original_post>

    <text>Not sure if this would get seen but with regards to this, I wanna ask the moderators to hold their judgment on OPs being "trojan horses" or for violating Rule B, specifically giving more time for OPs to respond beyond the initial 3 hours. 

I have definitely had a few CMVs in the past be removed simply because I wasn't convinced by the arguments that were presented at that point of time, and moderators removed the post within a few hours of its uploading. Just wanna make the point that Reddit isn't a full-time job for people and a lot of people aren't going to be camping at their PCs/phones to respond to arguments here.</text>

    <text>The problem is that what you don't see is the massive number of posts that will never receive a response at all. I'd like to note that due to the way deltas work, there's generally a quite significant advantage in delta earning likelihood by being one of the first to a thread. In almost all cases excluding particularly in-depth or esoteric topics, basically all threads have substantial engagement within half an hour.

To that end, I'd suggest simply delaying the post until you have time to reply in a short timespan. I don't think there's much delay between posting and having material to engage with.</text>

    <text>Fair enough, but "substantial engagement" doesn't always equal to "sufficient engagement to change a view". 

It's really just my opinion on how things should be done, but I think this sub is gonna miss out on a lot more valuable discussion by restricting the time frame as much as it currently does.</text>

    <text>This is a discussion forum. You should be responding to posts that don’t change your view right away, challenging them. Most delta’s are awarded several comments into a comment chain.

*Ask clarifying questions* about comments that don't change your view. Actively *attempt* to find the commenter's *best argument against your view* rather than attacking them. That's the kind of behavior that is expected of OPs in CMV.</text>

If someone's wrong, they're wrong, and you should be allowed to correct them. Doesn't matter if you're OP or not, removing things because users "challenge" other users is an echo chamber, not a discussion forum.</text>

    <text>"Substantial engagement" is required to fully meet the goals of the sub. Comments sufficient to change a view are more likely to happen during back and forth dialogue. Generally that takes engagement and clarification by the OP, even to comments that do not adequately rebut the premise right from the start.

If you have a view that you hold strongly enough to make a good submission, it is likely going to require on-going discussion to get to the underlying assumptions that may be weak. If you knew where every one of those vulnerable assumptions were, you wouldn't bother posting a CMV. You would either have already changed your position, or discounted them as inadequate and decided your stance was unassailable.</text>

I'm struggling to see how these statements could be true simultaneously. They are directly contradictory to one another. 

Either you have a large number of posts that are not being commented on, OR basically all threads have substantial engagement early on. It can't be both.</text>

    <text>Oh that's a little different, then. To me, "posts" refers to OP's contribution and "comments" refer to subsequent replies, so when I see comments about "the massive number of posts that will never receive a response at all" I would assume you mean topics where there have been no comments in reply.

This is how they are labelled in your inbox and conflating the two is somewhat confusing in this context.

I get what you're saying now, though, and it is not self-contradictory. Just a little unclear.</text>

    <text>I think one thing that's contributing to this is the 3 hour rule. If you would give people a bit more time to respond, you'd probably get fewer of these. Could you give a justification why the rule is so strict? Are people really that impatient that they can't wait for a day or so for OP to respond to their argument or give a delta? 

I'd argue that if you give a bit more time for the counter-arguments to pile up, then the OP can actually award the delta to the one that's most convincing one instead of the first who said something to that direction, but not really made the best argument. 

When I'm reading these discussions, especially if there are hundreds of comments, it would be really useful if the best arguments were at the top and they were the ones that got the delta.</text>

It is less about being impatient and more about OPs not returning to reply _at all_.

There is no way for us to know when a post if made if the OP is a 'hit and run' poster who will never come back, or someone who is here for legitimate discussion.  Leaving posts up longer for the former hurts the sub, but leaving posts up longer for the later would help it.

So, the question put to us is which is more beneficial for the sub as a whole?  Do we leave posts up longer so people have more time to respond and accept the increase in hit and run posters, or do we keep a strict time limit to try and limit the damage of the hit and run poster at the expense of people who may not have 3 hours handy?  From what we have observed, the former is more damaging than the latter.

We don't feel that the 3 hour rule is all that tough a bar to pass.  You have to be around _eventually_ to respond to posts, so if you don't have time right now just wait a bit and post later.  There is nothing wrong with getting a post ready, posting it an hour or so before you'll have a bit of time to respond to comments, then coming back after an hour to reply to the comments that came in.  If you don't even have the time to do _that_, then you probably don't have time to be an OP here.</text>

True. For that problem, you could institute bans for those who do that and maybe karma limits for the first post. This way people wouldn't be able do this. 

So, if someone posts something and then never shows up to defend their view, they'd be banned from the sub. 

&amp;gt;We don't feel that the 3 hour rule is all that tough a bar to pass. You have to be around eventually to respond to posts, so if you don't have time right now just wait a bit and post later. 

I think the problem is that you need to have the 3 hours continuously. Let's say you post something. It's not the normal "trans people are bad" post that is going to immediately raise emotions, but something more obscure topic. Nobody responds anything for the first 2 hours and you give up waiting. Then a few people show up and your post ends up deleted because you didn't respond to them. 

So, even if you had time right after posting your post, you may not have it continuously for the entire 3 hours.</text>

We do both.  It doesn't stop it.  It is far too easy to farm enough karma on Reddit to bypass our filters.  Reddit's alt account policies are incredibly lax.

&amp;gt;I think the problem is that you need to have the 3 hours continuously. 

That is a common misconception.  You don't need to sit there for 3 hours continuously.  You can post, come back in an hour or two and respond to the comments that came in.

The situation you described, where a post sits dormant for 2 hours then gets a flurry of activity in hour 3 is exceptionally rare - so rare that it isn't worth trying to account for that edge case in policy.  On the rare occations where it _does_ happen, all you have to do is come back when you are able, respond to those comments and we'll restore the post.</text>

    <text>No worries.

It is hard for an average user to get a sense of everything that we remove because, well, we remove it.  Most of the removals for Rule E are for posts that have had zero activity over a span longer than 3 hours - and were likely people who just wanted to soapbox rather than engage in serious discussion.  Often, these people will 'appeal' the removal and when we tell them to just comment a bit to get it restored, they lash out and refuse - further reinforcing the idea that they were never here for real discussion.

The sad fact is that with 1.3M subscribers, people are going to see our sub as an avenue to soapbox, which is the much bigger concern.  As with most of the rules, we have to design for the big problems, even if that means a small handful of good-faith submissions get caught up in the wake.</text>

    <text>How did you get that impression?  I think it’s very reasonable that if someone starts a topic, they should be expected to respond to it within 3 hours.  If you can’t then wait until you can.  Otherwise, why are you starting a CMV at that point in time?  Is it supposed to serve as a placeholder until later when you have time to respond? Is it equivalent to starting the car and letting it warm up before you intend to drive it?</text>

Post the CMV, go start cooking dinner, come back in half an hour once it's in the oven.

    <text>Believe what you will, but the 3 hour rule exists to try and strike a balance between OP and commenter.

Writing out a well researched and well thought out comment in response to an OP, only to have that OP vanish and never return is _deeply_ frustrating - you wasted a ton of effort and you never got any engagement on an argument you put a great deal of time into.  That makes for a very negative experience on our sub.

At the same time, and OP might sit around for an hour or so, not have any comments come in, take a break, and find they are flooded with responses a bit later.  That does happen from time to time, and the OP shouldn't be punished because they stepped away for a bit.

The 3 hour rule is our attempt at compromise between the two positions.  The OP needs to show respect for commenters by being present within a reasonable window to engage, but at the same time that window isn't so strict that they have to spend every second in front of their keyboard exclusively replying to comments.  Its not perfect, but it is the best balance we've been able to strike.</text>

Again, boo fucking hoo. This isn't the presidential debates, nobody should be taking this so seriously anyways. With all due respect, I'd argue that the amount of time being a Reddit moderator commands inherently biases you towards thinking it's "normal" to be on Reddit as much as many people are, and to take it as seriously as many people do. If you get ***genuinely upset and/or frustrated*** over a social media website, and someone not taking it as seriously as you, it might be time to put the phone down for a while.

At the end of the day, I don't use the sub often enough to really care about the rules, or how they're enforced, anyways. The sense of self importance just really put me off.</text>

    <text>Likewise, I care about this sub and this community and all that I've gained from being a part of it. 

But I genuinely do think that it's not beneficial to the health of the sub to remove people's posts after 3 hours (which is honestly quite short for anyone who has a real life going on). This sub is meant for discussion, and the nature (and benefit) of online discussions is precisely that we can take our time to think through our responses and reply when we are able to do so. Why do we have to treat it like a face-to-face conversation when there is little value in doing so?

It also doesn't make sense to say that you want to create a better experience for the users by removing posts that aren't responded to after 3 hours. It's equally frustrating for the people who spent so much effort crafting their posts, only to have it removed because they didn't reply fast enough or worse, because they didn't get convinced fast enough. I've personally had experiences with the latter, where I was still in the midst of engaging with commenters (although having a gap of maybe a few hours between my initial comments and later comments), but it got removed.

FWIW, there will always be people who are going to post and ignore the comments anyway, people who don't actually care about discussing and engaging with the repliers. These aren't the people who are important to the community, it's the other people who are genuinely interested in having discussions but logistically unable to commit so much time to it that are truly valuable to the community, but we're missing out on so many discussions because of this rule.</text>

    <text>Your critique is fair, but as I said it is a balancing act between what is good for OPs and what is good for commenters.  You say there is no value in pulling these, but I can tell you from my experience that the majority of Rule E pulls are for time periods of longer than 3 hours (we don't always have the coverage to get to them immediately) and typically have zero response from the OP.  CMV is about discussion, so you have to be around to discuss.

Even then, our bar for 'discussion' is pretty low.  If you have half a dozen decent comments within 3 hours, we aren't going to pull the post.  We don't expect you to spend every second of the 3 hours replying, but we do expect some effort within that timeframe.

I'll also add that if you do get a post pulled for Rule E, all you have to do to get it restored is come back and reply to people.</text>

If you don't have the time, that's a sign that you should save posting it until you do. Keep in mind, you don't have to be available the entire 3 hours- any time within that is fine.

If you don't have that time, you probably shouldn't be posting it.

&amp;gt;It's equally frustrating for the people who spent so much effort crafting their posts

If you have the time and effort to make the post, you have the time and effort to reply to the post.

&amp;gt;because they didn't get convinced fast enough

You don't have to get convinced fast enough, you just need to engage. (You can also appeal it, and they're fairly lenient on it.)

&amp;gt;FWIW, there will always be people who are going to post and ignore the comments anyway, people who don't actually care about discussing and engaging with the repliers.

There will. But that doesn't mean we can't actively reduce it.

&amp;gt;These aren't the people who are important to the community, it's the other people who are genuinely interested in having discussions

The people who get burnt out responding to no-shows are equally, if not more important.

&amp;gt; it's the other people who are genuinely interested in having discussions but logistically unable to commit so much time

I'd argue that if you can't commit the time it takes, you simply don't have the time to have a genuine discussion, even if the interest is genuine.</text>

I think the solution here is to plan your posts for a time when you will be able to return in a reasonable time to respond.

Sometimes something comes up and you can't and that's perfectly understandable - shit happens. But in those cases you can just try again at another time, you aren't banned or anything.</text>

&amp;gt;At the end of the day, I don't use the sub often enough to really care about the rules, or how they're enforced, anyways.

Yeah, that's kind of the point. The rules are for the people who actually do use the sub.

As you said- boo fucking hoo.</text>

    <text>&amp;gt; If you get genuinely upset and/or frustrated over a social media website, and someone not taking it as seriously as you, it might be time to put the phone down for a while.

Let's reframe the issue.

You write out several great arguments in several threads. In each of those threads, the OP fucks off into the sunset instead of responding to anyone.

You don't get any engagement, you think "well, what's the point?" and don't bother again.

This happens to a lot of people and slowly the sub dies.</text>

    <text>You sound like the type of person who enter a new game and when you are told the rules, you start complaining that the rules are lame and how much fun it would be if there was no rule. And when you are told that it wouldn't work, you lecture people about how miserable their life must be to care about this game. 

This sub is an "anonymous online debate club game" and the 3 hours rule is just the equivalent of a chess club having a rule that if you start a game, you should finish it for the simple reason that no one like to play against leavers in online game. It's as simple as that: there's nobody getting mad but just game organizers worrying that leavers are making the game less fun for everyone.</text>

    <text>I accused the ***mods*** of taking this too seriously. That isn't necessarily indicative of time spent; I, personally, dick around on Reddit almost the entire time I'm at work because I happen to have a largely hands off job. But at the end of the day, I could lose my entire account and be forced to start over, and just shrug it off. It's just a fun time killer to me. It might be difficult to find something to replace it with if I were to lose it entirely, but it could be done.

Meanwhile, there are people who delete their comments if they get too many downvotes to protect their precious karma, mods that are on ***nearly ever single subreddit that used to be part of the default group***, plus more than those, who ban you on every single one of those subs for personal slights, and people constantly screeching and crying about "reposts" because it's "karma whoring".

Setting that aside, this really isn't up for debate. A ***lot*** of mental health experts have come forward and expressed concern over people taking the internet too seriously, as well as social media addiction.

    <text>&amp;gt;Writing out a well researched and well thought out comment in response to an OP, only to have that OP vanish and never return is deeply frustrating

Not really. 

Honestly, I think this is more of an issue of managing expectations. Such is the nature of the internet. Even if OP doesn't respond, other people interested in the topic will. Be removing the posts because of OP, you are purposefully stifling an entire other area of dialogue that organically happens on the internet. If anything, something that probably occurs at a much greater frequency than OP responding to commenters and vice versa. Seems counter intuitive to me.</text>

    <text>&amp;gt; At the same time, and OP might sit around for an hour or so, not have any comments come in, take a break, and find they are flooded with responses a bit later. That does happen from time to time, and the OP shouldn't be punished because they stepped away for a bit.

This is why I do not believe the time limit should start after the OP, but after the replies.

I think it should be within one hour after after the third reply.</text>

    <text>CMV, at minimum, tries to uphold the appearance of taking itself seriously, and though it is difficult to isolate causal variables it remains one of the few subreddits in which people can comfortably engage with opposing ideas in good faith.

It is not clear that the benefit of allowing posts go uncontested for several hours outweigh the costs which likely include an uptick in soapbox views with no intent to change. You and others may identify this stringency and level of analysis to be "too" serious, but that sentiment is condescending and not universally held.</text>

I couldn't care less about how commonly it's held by common people, I care about what psychologists have identified as social media obsession being so prevalent. People take social media ***way*** too seriously, to the point that some even show symptoms of the lines between it and real life blurring in their mind. If you think that your debate forum on a social media website, that's ***most likely*** going to be gone in 5-10 years once the government finds a way to reliably regulate the internet, truly matters enough such that people should be held to specific participation standards, then you shouldn't be on social media.</text>

    <text>Your stance logically resolves with the abolishment of subreddit/forum/any online platform rules altogether. Everyone has standards for participation, with more or less stringency. People even get banned on 4chan. The notion that holding people to specific standards to participate is bad/irrelevant/harmful is nonsensical. You can disagree on level of stringency and argue that more or less stringency means taking things more or less seriously, but arguing against the notion of standards altogether is absurd.

Feel free to try and find someplace that allows engagement with absolutely no standards. I suspect what you'll find are places that align with your own set of standards.</text>

This is a gross misrepresentation of my point, and the specific language used. But fine, I'll change it to standard for how active you are.

    <text>With regard to standards of activity, few communities are built around the goal of inviting contentious views for purposes of change. I don't agree with your general stance on other communities with similar standards, and it still seems condescending in that you seem to think you hold the rulebook on what "matters," but comparing a subreddit that revolves around interacting and changing views to other communities with different purposes is a false equivalency.

I wouldn't expect CMV to have a rule regarding verification like the science subreddit because CMVs goals do not rely on expertise. I wouldn't expect the science subreddit to have rules about OP participation because threads can progress and serve their intended function regardless of OP's interaction. This latter statement is not true for CMV; if OP does not interact, the thread no longer aligns with the purported function of the subreddit. You may believe this purported function is self-important, but then I'd wonder why you would even engage?</text>

It doesn’t matter if they’d reply after 3 hours, no cmv readers will be looking at their post at that point. When you go to cmv, you may look at the new page and the top page. Rarely does anyone dig further than that. 

Posts are only in those spaces temporarily. A post may be in the top page for a day but readers who open the post and see no replies usually aren’t going to reopen it later just to check if suddenly there are replies. 

They are going to stick to reading the active discussions or they’re going to go somewhere else on Reddit. If the top page gets filled with non responsive OPs, readers and engages are going to stop bothering to read any posts.

Then there’s also the fact that if you wait too long to reply to someone who made a thought out post to you, they will have forgotten the context and be less likely to want to continue the discussion. Which results in even less interesting posts here and less readership.</text>

    <text>Any time limit to respond set by the mods is arbitrary, by definition. Focusing on the arbitrariness of the time limit is meaningless. The cutoff has to be *somewhere*, and three hours was determined as a good cutoff point at the time the rule was instated.

If there's no time limit or if the time limit is too long, then there's less to no incentive for the creator of a post to revisit their post and reply to people's comments. By the time they come back to their post, most people will have already lost interest.

The three-hour time limit works well enough. You'd have a strong argument for a four- or six-hour time limit if you could provide a large enough list of posts where the OP only began substantially responding to their post at the 3-4 or 3-6 hour time mark. But those kinds of posts are few and far between.</text>

That's a strange argument considering that the post will be deleted if the OP hasn't responded within 3 hours. So, there are not going to be *any* posts with OP not responding anything within the first 3 hours and then responding a lot in the next 3 hours as this kind of posts can't exist in this sub. 

Of course the mods could run a test period, say a week when they allowed posts to stay, say, for a day and then took a look when the OPs first responded to the argument.</text>

A post isn't *deleted* for having no responses from OP within the 3 hours, it's *removed*. There's a difference. A deleted post means it's erased by the OP, where the OP isn't able to interact with the post anymore. A removed post means it's erased by the mods, and only means newcomers won't be able to interact with the post. The OP, and others who have already interacted in the removed post, can continue to interact in that post even if it gets removed.

So, if there are enough removed threads where the OP has responded within the 3-4 or 3-6 hour time window, then yes, that is indeed a strong argument for extending the 3-hour time limit.</text>

Should twitch streamers that invite callers onto the show also be as inclusive as you suggest. What if a caller can only ask a question and then walk away from his phone for 15 minutes until he comes back and says one more sentence and repeats that taking an hour to respond 3 times? Would you hold streamers to waiting in silence for 15 minutes until they could come back?

This sub is for entertainment. The mods are tasked with ensuring we find quality entertainment here. If I come onto the sub every day and see a bunch of posts by people who pose a view and then take off for 24 hours, I'm not coming back very many times. Now you have an empty sub because anyone who actively participates has left and the remaining people only comment every 24 hours. Each post takes a week to get 7 comments deep.

As someone who reads this sub a lot, the front page top upvoted posts, usually has about up to 1/4 of posts with no responses from OP. That makes discussion on those posts impossible. That’s with the 3 hour rule.

If the rule was longer such as 24 hours, it would be way more top posts with no discussion. 

By the time you respond to your post, it’s no longer on the top page or in new meaning no one will find it to read and contribute to the discussion after you decide to engage. That is the cost.

With the 3 hour rule there’s usually 2 or 3 posts on the the top page of this sub with OP having no replies. Those posts are boring to read. Without the 3 hour rule it would be a lot more posts with no replies. With a 24 hour rule, those posts will disappear from the top page and no longer be in the new section. Therefore by the time OP responds, the readers of this sub will not see those responses unless OP replies to them directly. This means no further engagement from new perspectives when the OP inevitably makes their argument clearer. 

And it means coming to this sub to read the discussions to no longer be a thing as there won’t be any discussions to read on the top page.

If i can't allocate that, i won't make the post. There can be some debate whether the rule is actually necessary or not, but i think the rule is not really hard to follow.

I think of it like AMA. Answering hours after the response will also be a hindrance for conversation there too.</text>

    <text>Perhaps posts could include the timeframe in which the OP expects to be able to reply. Like you can make the argument to put aside half and hour but that might not be much of a discussion. Not everyone can put a few hours aside in any given day. So istead of asking people to set aside a few hours in a day we give them the option to say they are willing to reply to at least X number of comments every hour with X having a minumum like 0.5, 1, or 2. Then people can post and respond periodically. By giving the option to say how much they intent to respond it put the honess on them to meet what they say or at least the minimum while allowing posts to have less immediate engagement without succumbing to the 3 hour rule 🤷‍♂️</text>

    <text>Totally disagree. The Trojan horse posts the mods are referring to are obvious to anyone who reads this sub regularly.

If this sub was like /r/AskHistorians and didn't remove posts, a search for "binary gender" or "trans athletes" or "the n-word" or "cultural appropriation" would turn up a ridiculous number of posts.</text>

    <text>Yeah, the bad faith posts are a massive problem and they’re usually pretty blatant. I feel like extending too much grace is just a go-ahead for trolls.</text>

    <text>&amp;gt; Just wanna make the point that Reddit isn't a full-time job for people and a lot of people aren't going to be camping at their PCs/phones to respond to arguments here.

There are plenty of places to shoot the shit or argue. If you wanna do CMV, it doesn't seem that difficult to hold your post until you're available to interact with the community.

If you have *no* period where you'll be able to regularly interact with the community, it seems like /r/CMV may not be the place for you. That's fine, you can find other places to post to. But it's like telling the MLB to cut games down to four innings when you buy tickets because you personally don't have a couple hours to watch the whole thing.</text>

    <text>Fortunately or unfortunately, there really isn't anything else like CMV. That's the beauty of it - it's a unique community that can discuss just about anything and get a meaningful discussion out of it. There's nowhere else to go.

I don't know what you do with your life outside of Reddit, but do you realise that some people genuinely do not have the time to keep checking back on a post? It's very difficult to do any meaningful work with your attention being dragged away to go debate on a post every few minutes. Even if I had 3 full hours to myself, it also doesn't make sense for me to sit here doing nothing and just waiting for people to reply so I can respond to them instantly.</text>

    <text>&amp;gt;it's a unique community that can discuss just about anything and get a meaningful discussion out of it.

There is a specific reason for that. It didn't happen as a coincidence, it's because mods enforce rules to foster good discussion. 

&amp;gt; There's nowhere else to go.

There are tons and tons of places to go to discuss whatever views you want. If you want a place of quality discussion then you need to acknowledge that that discussion comes from discussion-based rules and moderation.

I was giving you the benefit of the doubt at first but failing to address my points and reverting back to claiming you don't have time is just playing the victim to try and get special treatment. If you don't have time for quality discussion, go somewhere that promotes relaxed discussion.

You are asking to have your cake and eat it too. You can't have it both ways.</text>

I get where you're coming from. Sadly, just because CMV may be the only one of its kind for a certain audience of people to go, it doesn't also follow that CMV must change their mold to fit everyone in that audience. It should change to fit as many in that audience as possible, just so long as the new audience it gets outweighs the audience it loses. It doesn't have to fit everyone.

For any given time limit, there's going to be *someone* who isn't satisfied with that time limit because it's too short for them. But there has to be a good balance point. Three hours happens to be what the mods found to be good at the time the rule was put into effect.

&amp;gt;I don't know what you do with your life outside of Reddit, but do you realise that some people genuinely do not have the time to keep checking back on a post?

Yeah, there are posts from people who you say genuinely don't have the time to keep checking back on a post within the three-hour timespan that will never see the light of day because of the timespan rule.

But at the same time, the longer the time limit is, the more comments can accumulate for an OP to have to respond to before the time limit gets reached. This means more replies for the OP to make, but a given OP can only reply to X amount of comments per unit time, which means more commenters have their comments go unanswered. The higher this number, the more unwilling people are willing to comment; after all, why comment if there's a high enough chance that it won't receive a response?

&amp;gt;It's very difficult to do any meaningful work with your attention being dragged away to go debate on a post every few minutes.

Most people get free time in bursts. For sake of example, if a prospective poster's free time is 30 minutes long, then they should probably not create a post in the last few minutes of that 30-minute timeframe, especially if they know that they can't comment to any potential responses within the three-hour time window. They should instead create the post in the first few minutes, so that comments can come in and they can reply accordingly within the 30 minutes. If it takes long enough to write up a post such that the post is finished in the last few minutes of that free time, that post can always be saved somewhere and pasted back into the Submit a Post box during the next free time allotment.

With the given example, there really only has to be sufficient engagement on the OP's part in the 25 or so minutes they've allotted themselves to reply to comments. The rest of the 2.5 hours in the three-hour window doesn't need responses, based on rule E.

Of course, it's also possible that in those 25 minutes, there's no response to the thread whatsoever, but someone replies the very moment the OP's free time has ended. If they aren't able to get back to their post within the three hours, then the post may get removed by rule E. This isn't a problem, insofar that an "uncontrollable" rule E violation isn't vastly different than a "controllable" rule B violation.

&amp;gt;Even if I had 3 full hours to myself, it also doesn't make sense for me to sit here doing nothing and just waiting for people to reply so I can respond to them instantly.

If the first response to a post is well beyond the initial "peak response" period of 30-45 minutes or so, it's reasonable to believe that you've gone around to other things for the moment and aren't readily in front of your computer or phone to respond to a comment, and that's taken into account. If the first comment happens 2 hours and 59 minutes since your post was created, obviously you're not expected to comment within the 1 minute or else it's a rule E violation.</text>

    <text>This happened to me with a huge post that blew up about the movement to silver, gold, platinum to emojis that feel meaningless and like social media. The problem was, literally not a single comment disagreed so there wasn't someone to even change my view lol</text>
