    <title>CMV: women are not going for the 'upper tier' of men</title>
    <original_poster>BadgerSame6600</original_poster>
    <original_post>I see this rhetoric over and over and over online, and hear it IRL sometimes.  It drives me crazy tbh. I am a man out in the world, living life, 35 years of it now. I have friends who are all over the spectrum of physical attractiveness. Some are single, most aren't. Their gfs/wifes are also across the spectrum. In most couples I know, friends and acquaintances,  the woman is better looking, earns more, or has more social skills ect. 

Now I know this is my experience, so it is anecdotal, but at the same time I just don't buy this whole women are too choosy. My opinion is that the dudes who say this are refusing to address their flaws and accept them. If these men believe this and they go out into the world feeling hard done by, fighting a losing battle, then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Most people can smell that level of victimhood a mile of. 

OK, open to have this challenge, so- change my view, Redditors! </original_post>

    <text>I just want to throw in my two cents to say most of the phenomenon is really about online dating. Everybody focuses on the endless Chad's you're competing against, but at least half of  the problem is the endless simps you're competing against.

Online you're competing against basically a limitless supply of guys with 6 packs looking for easy sex, and guys that are willing to simp for basically nothing. You can't really blame women  when they can get easy attention for basically nothing, and easily access the hottest guys in a 50 mile radius. Still a crappy dating situation for most men though.</text>
