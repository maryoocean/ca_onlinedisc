    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>American cops don‚Äôt save people from getting killed. I wouldn‚Äôt spontaneously commit a felony if police weren‚Äôt there. Would you? 

American cops at the end of the day are here to make society feel safe (they do a terrible job at it) but catching ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù and exacting revenge. 

If you look at the basic functions, there‚Äôs no difference between police and satan if you follow a Christian religion.</text>

    <text>The only reason US is even borderline safe is because of police. They are a huge deterrent to crime. 

And it's funny people in one breath will say cops don't catch criminals then in another breath will say we have 25% of the world incarcerated. So which one is it? 

Look at the violent crime charts from 1980 till 2020. Why do you think it fell? Probably due to good law enforcement.</text>

    <text>It was because we had too many criminals running around. That's why we started giving them stiff sentences. Ask any police officer. 80% of your crime comes from like 20% of the individuals you arrest. They just repeat over and over and over and over. They don't fucking learn. As soon as we started handing out stiff sentences to those losers. Crime stats started improving. It's not rocket science. Some people need to be locked up for their own good and for ours.</text>

    <text>You're welcome to present counter-evidence. 

"Bruce Western of Harvard University found that a 10% decrease in crime rate occurred with a 10% increase in incarceration, and ultimately the 90% drop in crime from 1993 to 2001 would have happened without the prison boom experienced by the U.S. as a result of ‚Äútough on crime‚Äù policies."

My wife had a friend who got locked up for pot. The prison let him get a pharmacy tech certification, then when he got out, he couldn't get a job because he had a drug related criminal history. Make it make sense.</text>

    <text>No rehabilitation is a myth. Most people in prison don't change. They come out and do the same shit. Especially the particularly egregious one's. 

We already spend a ton of $ trying to rehabilitate them. Often for not. 

We give people plenty of 2nd and 3rd chances. By the time someone is in prison they've gotten multiple convictions. Very unusual to go to prison on your first offense.

    <text>[Really?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1344622309000674)

Have you considered that your belief is unfounded in reality and not supported by data?

There are many socio-economic factors that go into why crime is the way it is, and also that it is unfairly assessed. A poor person is more likely to go to prison than a rich person, for example. Sometimes people turn to crime out of desparation for things like food or housing insecurity. Perhaps if we addressed actual societal problems that lead to crime, we wouldn't have as much of a problem as we do. 

Even without fully addressing these issues, simply reforming the prison system would have drastic improvements. [Norway](https://www.firststepalliance.org/post/norway-prison-system-lessons) had recitivism rates comparable to modern U.S. rates before they reformed their prison system, and now they have some of the lowest rates world wide. 

But hey, if you want to continue living in this delusion that rehabilitation is a myth and there is no way to fix a person, that's your problem, just don't drag the rest of us down with you.</text>

Like, sure, if your nation's system of governance is *so strict* and economic life is *so demanding* with no wiggle room for negative feedback against the panopticon-induced paralysis that it's [effectively killing your populace in slow motion](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Society/Singapore-fertility-rate-hits-new-low-putting-focus-on-housing-prices), then, granted, you may get some nominally pristine crime stats.

    <text>There‚Äôs no point in talking if you can only skim the surface of topics like you just did but I‚Äôll indulge out of ego. 

Does the U.S. have the worst police out of any developed country since the U.S. has the most crime? They don‚Äôt deter that much then. 

We have 25 % of the worlds incarcerated population. I don‚Äôt feel unsafe because somebody smoked weed in Louisiana and is prison now. A woman getting an abortion doesn‚Äôt scare me. Do you think she‚Äôs coming after you getting an abortion? Correlation is not causation. 

Do you know that‚Äôs the specific reason violent crime fell? Or can you admit there‚Äôs multiple things that influence who wants to commit crime. But let‚Äôs look at statistics and let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm a deranged violent criminal. I have over a 50% chance of murdering someone and getting away with it. All I have to do is be a slightly above average murderer and I‚Äôll never see jail time. How is that a great deterrent? Obviously it‚Äôs not because there are a lot of murderers in the U.S. because people for whatever reason think police are gods.</text>

US has a ton of criminals. Criminality is a big part of the urban culture. We need more cops. 

&gt;We have 25 % of the worlds incarcerated population. I don‚Äôt feel unsafe because somebody smoked weed in Louisiana and is prison now. A woman getting an abortion doesn‚Äôt scare me. Do you think she‚Äôs coming after you getting an abortion? Correlation is not causation.

If you actually looked at who is in prison. You would see that it's habitual offenders. You have to be convicted something like 10-11 times on average before you spend a day in prison. These are people that belong there. Not your regular weed smokers or someone getting an abortion. These are people who commit crime non stop. Of which we have a lot in US.

&gt; All I have to do is be a slightly above average murderer and I‚Äôll never see jail time. How is that a great deterrent? Obviously it‚Äôs not because there are a lot of murderers in the U.S. because people for whatever reason think police are gods.

It's still a lot better than doing nothing. Imagine if we stopped enforcing laws. Do you think it would make us a safer place? If some city decided to stop enforcing theft laws for instance. Do you think it would make it safer to conduct business there? Of course not. All the businesses would just shut their damn doors. You need law enforcement and deterrents work.</text>

It‚Äôs not 10-11 times to be in prison, but let‚Äôs go with your metrics. Should we arrest everyone the first time for life since they‚Äôll just do it again according to you?

Police can only do so much to deter. Luckily criminals are mostly disorganized here, but there‚Äôs 0 reason why a cartel couldn‚Äôt overtake a U.S. city at any point if they chose to. They have enough weaponry and can fight an insurgent type of battle that would deter people from joining the police. The way to lower the crime rate is to provide a society where people don‚Äôt want to commit crime regardless if police are there or not. 

The vast Majority of the US crime is because of the American mentality. That‚Äôs what needs to change.</text>

You're not understanding. If you studied how many times an average person has to be convinced in order to see 1 day in prison. You'd get a number between 10 and 11. Meaning if someone is in prison they are a habitual offender.

They would all get obliterated. You underestimate the firepower our law enforcement has. They wouldn't last a day. Not to mention our population is armed to the teeth. 

&gt;Why does the U.S. have a ton of criminals? If police were good we wouldn‚Äôt have them.

US is very uneven. Places line Norway, Sweden, Denmark. They are very even. Not too many super low IQ people. Not too many super high IQ people. US on the other hand is very uneven. You have some of the most talented people on the planet living in US. and you have 1000s upon 1000s of totally useless people. That are being dragged along by the massive amount of talent we import here through the immigration system. And before you think I'm racist a large chunk of that talent is from India and China.

    <text>If the Narco cartel took over a city. Let's say on the border somewhere. Within about 5-6 hours that place would be completely surrounded by 1000s of law enforcement and possibly the National Guard. It would turn into a giant hostage situation. Similar to Waco.

More than likely eventually most of them get killed. 

That's just how it goes. If you think it can go any other way you simply don't understand how this country works.</text>

    <text>Yes that‚Äôs exactly what would happen you‚Äôre correct. But let‚Äôs say every major cartel did that in every major city in Texas as an example. Do you think law enforcement and the state national guard would be enough? Remember they would just get killed like sinaloan cops do. 

Also with Waco everyone was in a house so it was clearly identifiable. It would be more accurate to compare it to Afghanistan, and I‚Äôm sure you know how that turned out.</text>

    <text>The reason violent crime fell is so much more complex than simply saying tougher policing. In some cities, yes, violent crime decreased when more police were added. However, in some cases, cities decreased their police force and violent crime decreased. If you asked a researcher whether they thought police were a significant deterrent, the most they would probably say is that they are a slight deterrent. However, a lot of them would also probably say that it‚Äôs unclear if the benefits are worth the downsides.</text>

    <text>Increased police violence and decreased public trust in police. Plus it uses resources that could be used to fund much more beneficial programs. 

If you want to decrease violent crimes, investing in mental health, rehabilitation, and education is more beneficial than increased police. It honestly might be better to spend the money on street lights.</text>

    <text>There is no more beneficial program towards reducing crime than police. Almost all police violence is aimed at violent criminals. That is a good thing. That is the only language those shit birds understand.

Decreased public trust comes from race grifters who blow any situation they can latch on out of proportion. When's the last time we had a Saint George situation. Bet they are just praying for another cop to fuck up. It's already exceedingly rare. For every cop fuck up that kills some violent criminal 10000 of them kill each other.

Increased police is by far the best approach. If safe streets is what you're after</text>

I live in America. Not only do I tolerate aggressive policing. I think it's a very good thing. Criminals are mostly bullies. They only understand force. No other language is even capable of getting through to them. You can't be nice to people who always see being nice as a sign of weakness.

It's like Putin. Only understands force. He is a typical criminal. Just happens to be in power. We often talk about how appeasing people like Putin is a terrible idea. Yet want to structure our law enforcement on appeasement of low lives.</text>

No. YOU SAID THIS.
