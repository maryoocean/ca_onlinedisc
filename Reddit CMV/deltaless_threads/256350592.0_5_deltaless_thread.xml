    <title>CMV: Spotlight was a marginal movie that didn't deserve all of the accolades that it received [Obvious spoilers]</title>
    <original_poster>layze23</original_poster>
    <original_post>   Am I the only one in the world that thought this movie was just ok? I mean, I really don't see the appeal. I guess the acting was good, but seriously, I didn't find it entertaining at all. My wife loved it. It's not like it was poorly written, had bad cinematography, or anything like that, I just found it... boring. I guess to me it was just a boring subject. "Yeah, priests molest little boys on a large scale. Is that it?" You could have written that on a post-it note and handed it to me and I think I would have had about the same reaction, but saved me 2 hours of my life. I don't know why I'm so bothered by this movie. I guess it's because I heard so many good things about it, I was expecting a lot more. I just felt like it was a newspaper article about an unentertaining subject that was made into a movie and won a ton of awards and accolades. 

   In contrast, I thought The Martian was excellent and I typically find space in general pretty uninteresting (I know, space should be really interesting, but that's a discussion for another day). I thought the Martian was a million times better than Spotlight. Like I said, I just don't understand the appeal of Spotlight. It wasn't even like there was a mystery to solve. I guess the only thing I can see as even slightly interesting is that nobody understood the magnitude of the problem and it was only through persistent journalism that it was even discovered. But, meh, so what?

   I'm not trying to undermine anyone's opinion that enjoyed the movie or even the movie itself. There are a lot of movies that I know are good that I just don't enjoy much and that's fine. I'm just baffled that I seem to be one of the rare few that feels this way about the movie and it bothers me more than it probably should that I can't understand what about it appeals to people.

   Counterpoint from a friend: "I sort of equate movies like spotlight to documentaries. Some of my favorite documentaries are ones that contain subjects I have no interest in or don't think I'd find enjoyable (ex: journalism, catholic church scandal) and it succeeds in making it fascinating. I liked how the story and scandal unfolded. I don't particularly have an interest in the journalistic process and definitely didn't think I'd want to watch anything involving the church scandal but I found it intriguing."

   My response: "I know what you're saying. The subject itself doesn't have be interesting in a vacuum to be the focal point of a good movie. I agree with that. But I guess even the plot development wasn't interesting to me. I mean, everything happened exactly as I anticipated it would. Maybe it would have been more interesting if there was an unanticipated event or if something happened behind the journalistic scenes that nobody knew about or would have expected. But we already know the story and it unfolded exactly how I would have expected it to play out. 

   For example, of course the church was trying to keep the skeletons in the closet. That's what I would expect that organization to do in that situation, and furthermore, we already knew that's what they did."

   Please, guys and gals, CMV.

    <text>I think what made this movie so popular was the very reserved way the story was told is pretty huge contrast to the way other stories are told in movies now. The director knew this was already the most touchy subject of all time, so instead of filling it with lines like "YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH" he showed 'real' people having natural responses to it. This material in another director/screenwriter hands might have made one of the journalist to be on a quest for vengeance after being abused by a priest as a child to make the story more compelling which would have ended up feeling phony and over dramatic. The very objective tone of this movie probably even changed some peoples minds who thought that it could never happen in their community and their church while the scandal was happening.


I really like the Martian book and movie to, it just doesn't have anything new to say that To Build A Fire or any other Jack London story already said. Not really much character driven drama which are what the committee looks for. </text>

    <text>That's an interesting perspective. I did notice that it felt very real and un-Hollywood like. Do people find enjoyment in that though? Do you really think the general public enjoyed the down-to-earth story-telling or do you think that's what,for lack of a better term, the "artsy critics" liked?</text>

    <text>It seems most people liked it

I was really excited to see it because the director, previously acted as a corrupt reporter in The Wire which also was a very popular tv show.</text>
