    <title>CMV: Public transportation should run 24/7.</title>
    <original_poster>Keep-reefer-illegal</original_poster>
    <original_post>We live in a world that is no longer 9-5. Businesses stay open later, friends can reach us with a portable device simply by typing on a mini keyboard. It doesn't make sense that public transportation isn't 24/7. Here are some reasons why it should be 24/7:

1. Very few buses run at 2 am for last call, I feel like if nothing else, running buses later let's responsible drunk people take public transit instead of driving home. 

2. It would benefit the working poor who may work night shift 

3. As mentioned before our world is now 24/7 

Those are my arguments. 

I encourage you all to change my view 

Edit: by transit I am including trains, buses, all forms of public transportation, not just buses.

    <text>Do you mean public transit, or *mass* public transit?  Because you could have efficient "public" (i.e. subsidized, government-provided) transit without using busses or trains.

That is, some kind of system where everyone gets a non-transferrable $20 of non-transferrable cab credit per day during the times when the busses/trains don't run[1].  Then there would be an "infrastructure" for getting people home, that would cost them (out of pocket) about what the buses do, but it wouldn't have to be run at such a loss as if they had to keep the full schedule.

So it seems like your argument is more for finding *some* way to subsidize transit at night.

[1] Before you balk at the seemingly high cost of such an effort, keep in mind that they could run the system through an app to pool rides, and most people wouldn't have a use for it on any given day.  And if people *did* flood the system with demand, they would know which lines to reactivate.</text>
