    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>They work to protect the ideals and conditions of the ruling class, who donâ€™t work

I believe this is why theyâ€™re often referred to as class traitors

As a side note, in my experience, it seems more like a lifestyle than a job, as in they seem to leisurely hang around together roaming the place, and still give coppy vibes when off duty.
Sometimes I see a super duper straight pedigree at a party, who appears to be acting to show no signs of vulnerability with perfect posture but no charisma and I think hmmmm ðŸ¤”</text>
