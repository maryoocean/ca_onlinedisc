    <title>CMV: Cooking up shit against famous dead people should be put to a stop immediately, as they are not there to defend themselves and will never be.</title>

    <original_post>I know Charlie Chaplin dated people up to 15 years younger than him, but now and then I always wonder whether some shitheads decided to cook up shit against him because he was dead and there would be nobody to contradict their statements. And then there's Bob Marley, the conspiracies against whom I am having serious doubts. Why would anybody bully his way to the top just for some fat cash, and then slide back to obscurity? And then there is Elvis, who dated virgin girls and fucked them albeit Priscilla herself downplayed these allegations. I do not understand it. Someone help me.</original_post>

    <text>You seem to think that there's no way to know what's true and what's false. Why do you think that? 

Let's take the case of Elvis for example. What do we know for sure?

- He started dating Priscilla when he was 24 and she was 14. He stopped having sex with her by her own admission after she had their kid.

His other known girlfriends:

Jackie Rowland, 14 / Elvis, 21

Gloria Mavel, 14 / Elvis, 22

Heidi Heissen, 14 / Elvis, 22

Frances Forbes, 13 / Elvis, 22

Sandy Ferra, 14 / Elvis, 25

Ann-Margaret, 22 / Elvis, 28

Reeca Smith, 14 / Elvis, 40

Those are the girlfriends that Elvis himself talked about in letters and conversations with his manager, wife, reporters, etc. There are photographs of them together. It's pretty reasonable to accept that those relationships happened. We don't know whether he actually had sex in all of those relationships. But does it really matter? There is a pretty clear pattern to suggest that Elvis gets interested in 14 year olds and loses interest by the time they're 25. We have a word for that. The man's an ephebpohile. What's wrong with acknowledging that? He also very clearly was never monogamous. What's wrong with being honest about that?

When Elvis was alive, there was a very clear effort made by his management, record label and the press to pass him off as a gentleman because that's what was socially acceptable. But that was a "cook-up" if ever there was one. Elvis was a polygamous ephebophile who was addicted to amphetamines. Isn't it better to be honest about that?

If it's wrong to tell lies about dead people, then don't we owe it to them to destroy the myths that surrounded them in life if those myths weren't accurate?</text>
