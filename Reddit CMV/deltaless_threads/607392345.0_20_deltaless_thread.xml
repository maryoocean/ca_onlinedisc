    <title>CMV: Legislative bodies should be required to explain, in formal writing, why they voted a certain way when it comes to legislation.</title>

    <original_post>I think publicly elected officials responsible for driving policy and legislation should be required to explain why they vote certain ways in writing. Voting along party lines is reprehensible regardless of the side. Politics shouldn't be a game about which side wins, but rather which fact-based opinions win regardless of sides. If the legislative bodies have no reasonable explanation for why they voted a certain way besides voting along party lines, they should not be allowed to vote because we have no reason to believe that they're not voting out of self-interest. If, for example, someone in Congress voted against what seems to be reasonable gun law without explanation, but you can see in their financial disclosure that the NRA contributes a lot of money and support for them, how are we to know that their vote was not influenced by the NRA without them explicitly citing so and explaining what other reason compelled them not to vote for said reasonable legislation? I'm not even asking for a long written response from them. A short paragraph or page summary with sources they're using to base their vote on is good enough. </original_post>

    <text>Is "my constituents wouldn't vote for me next election if I didn't vote this way" reasonable? Because that's what they're up against. If a representative in an area where the NRA has a lot of influence votes on a bill that limits gun ownership at all, they're going to have a hard time getting re-elected.

The NRA is one example, but a representative from a coal or oil producing area votes for strong climate change laws, they're threatening the jobs of the people who vote for them.

Is compromise a good reason? If they say "I don't really like this bill, but I reached an agreement with another representative that I'll back his bill if he backs the one that's important to me" will that fly? Those kinds of compromises are often key to bipartisan cooperation. </text>
