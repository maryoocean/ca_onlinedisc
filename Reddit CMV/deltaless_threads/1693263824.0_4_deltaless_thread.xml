    <title>cmv: Soccer would benefit from unlimited substitutions</title>
    <original_poster>cesarsalazar</original_poster>
    <original_post>Soccer (or football) only allows for 3 substitutions and once a player is out, s/he canâ€™t return. 

In my view, this rule is counterproductive. Allowing unlimited substitutions (like in other major sports) would have all or some of the following benefits, without any major downside:

- Increased speed of the game (players would have a chance to rest from sprinting, etc)

- More creative/imaginative gameplay. Coaches can combine different players to achieve different tactics.

- Increased player career span. Players have a better chance to recover from injuries. Less incentive to play while injured.

- Higher play quality. Naturally the players that perform better spend more time on the field.

What am I missing?</original_post>

    <text>unlimited substitutions favors teams with the budget to have pay more skilled players who normally wouldn't get fielded if they played for that team.

This wouldn't be that much of a big deal in the US MLS, where there are salary caps.

But, in most soccer leagues around the world, there are no salary caps.  Teams with larger budgets would try to fill the benches with a deeper team.

teams with less resources would struggle even more than they already do.</text>
