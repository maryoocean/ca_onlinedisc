    <title>cmv: Soccer would benefit from unlimited substitutions</title>
    <original_poster>cesarsalazar</original_poster>
    <original_post>Soccer (or football) only allows for 3 substitutions and once a player is out, s/he canâ€™t return. 

In my view, this rule is counterproductive. Allowing unlimited substitutions (like in other major sports) would have all or some of the following benefits, without any major downside:

- Increased speed of the game (players would have a chance to rest from sprinting, etc)

- More creative/imaginative gameplay. Coaches can combine different players to achieve different tactics.

- Increased player career span. Players have a better chance to recover from injuries. Less incentive to play while injured.

- Higher play quality. Naturally the players that perform better spend more time on the field.

What am I missing?</original_post>

    <text>It would ruin the flow of the game. It would give players less time to prove themselves. Players would get taken off for more frivolous reasons and not get the chance to make up for mistakes. Onfield relationships between players would be harder to build. Tactics may not have enough time to bed in. It would be disruptive to players being taken off and for those remaining on who now are playing with someone different. Changes to the other team would also be disruptive. Having too much freedom can be a bad thing. There are lots of other things that are done that make a difference like changing the positions of players or the formation or other tactics, without substitutions. It is a good test for the management in selecting the right subs, knowing that they are limited in what they can do. It might sound good in theory, but it would present a range of practical problems too.</text>
