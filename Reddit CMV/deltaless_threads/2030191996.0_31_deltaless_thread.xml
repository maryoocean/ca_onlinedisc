    <title>CMV: It's fair to compare carnists (people who eat meat) to nazis.</title>
    <original_poster>Arkenhiem651</original_poster>
    <original_post>1) Carnists think that animals are inferior; Nazis think that jews are inferior
2) Carnists put animals in camps; Nazis put jews in camps
3) Both jews and animals attempt to escape
4) Both are/were normalized. Anyone who goes against these beliefs were/are suppressed and treated as illogical/emotionally driven
5) Both are unnecessary 
6) Both are/were driven long distances and murdered
7) emotional detachment from the victims
8) Both are sentient
Alex Hershaft a holocaust survivor also used this comparison along with other vegan holocaust survivors.
"We're focusing on the victims rather than the cancer of oppression itself",[8] and that "I noted with horror the striking similarities between what the Nazis did to my family and my people, and what we do to animals we raise for food: the branding or tattooing of serial numbers to identify victims, the use of cattle cars to transport victims to their death, the crowded housing of victims in wood crates, the arbitrary designation of who lives and who dies — the Christian lives, the Jew dies; the dog lives, the pig dies."[6

Also Alex Hershshaft looks extremely young considering he's 88 and survived concentration camps. That's irrelevant but I thought it interesting enough to mention considering he claims it's due to his vegan diet.

Edit: I know I say Jews but this also applies to other victims of the concentration camps such as Slavic peoples, gays and communists</original_post>

I would agree with you up to here. It’s possible that animals are sentient but we don’t really know they are with a few exceptions (dolphins, whales, great apes etc.) and for that reason those animals are far more protected than livestock animals. An argument could be made for pigs and I’d definitely be in favor of banning pork for that reason. The rest I’m not sure. You could argue that it’d be better to er on the side of caution, but immediately banning all animal products would hurt a lot of humans too, and without strong evidence those animals can experience suffering in the way we and other higher intelligence animals do that suffering also has to be taken into account. I’m not referring to the people who would be sad they can’t eat meat, I mean the thousands of people who work and are affected by meat consumption, from the farmers, to the people who make the animal feed, the people working at the slaughterhouse to your local butcher.</text>
