    <title>CMV: Christianity is held together through fear</title>
    <original_poster>M1STER_B0NES</original_poster>
    <original_post>My opinion is that if the fear of going to Hell was not present in the Christian ideology, then most of the followers of the religion would not be there.

Before I decided I was agnostic, that was my only reason for continuing to identify with the religion. Then, I decided I wasn't going to let fear control me. 

All in all, I don't see how this is any different than blackmailing a person to do what you want. You present your instruction, then tell them how you will completely devastate their life if they do not follow through.</original_post>

    <text>Background: I am part of a   conservative denomination.  While we do talk about the final judgement, I can't say I have ever given very much thought to Hell as a punishment for my sin.  I focus more on the love of God who came down to die for my sins.  My belief is based on what I think is an analysis of the fact that Christianity is true.  If something is true then I have to respond in some way.  I can choose to do nothing or I can do something. My response is faith.  </text>
