    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>Did your professor forget about both world wars? Especially the second one where Germans literally killed people for existing? Even if hes not from germany its not like civilizations from south America didn't kill and take what they want. From what little I know Mayans use to murder people for their " gods" so idk what he's on about. Yes the usa has done terrible stuff but to act like those terrible things were not something every human civilization is capable of is just asking for it to happen again. Better yet it's dishonorable to the ones who suffered through it. To learn from out ancestors mistakes at least makes their suffering worth something. With that said i myself am a damn proud American. Not proud of everything we have done in our short time as a nation but I am proud of what we are supposed to stand for. I'd even say America is the glue that holds the global world together. We need to suit up and be the shining example the world so badly needs right now.</text>
