    <title>CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are not ethically superior to standard omnivorous diet</title>
    <original_poster>Kor03d</original_poster>
    <original_post>There is no point in becoming vegan or vegetarian in effort to save animals lives. Suffering or even death of a farm animal are no different to those of a tomato, even if it is harder to emotionally compassionate to the latter, as it is easier for us to relate to animal feelings. You can not exist without ending other creatures life for food, and animal lives are not more important than plants or fungi in that regard.

Please note that does not account for switching diet for own health reasons.

*EDIT: Yes, in my view I consider that plants can suffer even if they don't have the same mechanisms of perception animals do. Jellyfishes don't have a nervous system anywhere close to ours, yet it would still be unethical to cut one in pieces for amusement. Jellyfish would still perceive injury and its normal biological cycles would be hindered. Same goes for plants*

    <text>An apple is meant to be eaten as animals spread the seeds when they poop to new locations and this is very beneficial for the tree. And hence it doesn't suffer. This is therefore not the same as cutting a jellyfish, but something essential for the plant. I guess animals are meant to be eaten too in some cases.. 
However the apples are suggesting you eat them while the animals like a deer runs for their life to avoid it. 

Is this a valuable argument or no?
Love meat
and your thoughts but I like to argue</text>
