    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>The thing that gets me about estadounidense is that it is also Estados Unidos Mexicanos. If they’re Mexican then logic dictates we are American. 0.0 hate in that statement and I take no issue with a North or South Americans referring to themselves as American for short. When talking to Mexicans specifically, I would usually refer to myself as ‘gringo’ or ‘del otra lado.’ I would only use ‘estadounidense’ in very formal settings. I would NOT say ‘soy Americano’ unless I was talking about the continent I come from because that’s the meaning that statement carries in that language. If you’re speaking English, keep saying ‘I’m American’ because that’s what we call a US citizen in our language. Saludos!</text>
