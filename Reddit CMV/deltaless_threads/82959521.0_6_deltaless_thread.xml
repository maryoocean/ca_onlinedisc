    <title>In the Israel v. Palestine conflict, Israel is by far in the wrong and the US should cut ties with the country. CMV</title>

    <original_post>It seems all that I've seen about the conflict, is Israel either taking over Palestinian territory that isn't rightfully there's, imprisoning innocent Palestinian people, and making Palestine out to be the bad guys.

To me, it seems like all of the violence caused by Palestine is just an attempt to raise attention to their cause. I would necessarily agree with that, but their point is still valid.

    <text>It's irrelevant whether Jews or Palestinians are more native to Israel. Israel is a sovereign nation with the right, like any other nation, to protect its citizens and to self preservation. These rights are not more contingent on meeting anyone's idea of ethical perfection than any other country's right to exist is. Meanwhile the Palestinians have continuously aimed their attacks at Israeli civilians for decades. Israel is right to do whatever it can to keep weapons out of Gaza for that reason, and before the wall Israel suffered from constant suicide bombings... The Palestinians could have made peace at various times, but they, or a large constituency within them, want all or nothing. Since Gaza is ruled by terrorists who have vowed never to make peace, the Palestinians as a whole lack the political ability to make peace now.</text>
