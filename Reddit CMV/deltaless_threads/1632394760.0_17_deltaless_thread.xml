    <title>CMV: Space Tourism is a Waste of Resources</title>
    <original_poster>rsirdeshmukh</original_poster>
    <original_post>In 2021, three billionaires, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, and Elon Musk, entered the "space race" to take flight into space with no aim other than to reach suborbital space for a few minutes. 

While much of the world marvelled at this technological milestone, I was taken aback. If these billionaires get their way, there will be many spacecrafts jetting off to space for a joyride. This is scary because the carbon footprint of each of these space expeditions is extremely high due to the amount of fuel they use, the energy used to manufacture the fuel, and the soot generated which pollutes and damages the atmosphere while heating up the earth.

To me, space tourism seems like just an obscene display of power and wealth. With so many problems on earth, such as climate change and the pandemic, their money can be used more productively. Whether that is helping save earth or funding real space research, both are much better than just going up to space for a few minutes. Especially since doing so continues to exacerbate the wealth gap because space tourism is only a reality for those who can afford it while having serious implications on those left on earth.</original_post>

Here's the broader point - the technological milestones we achieve often in-and-of-themselves seem pointless. However when we take what we've learned from those accomplishments and apply it more widely, progress is made.

Space tourism is basically the test bed for the kind of reusable and reliable rocketry we're going to need if we want to become a space faring civilisation at some point. The technological experience and understanding we gain here is going to be essential for the future. 

To give a secondary example - think of LASIK. Eye tracking technology was first developed for NASA in order to assess how humans' frames of reference are affected by weightlessness. This tracking is the foundation of LASIK.</text>
