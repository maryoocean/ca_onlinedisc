    <title>CMV: A computer could do 90% of a doctor's job (general practitioner in particular).</title>
    <original_poster>OnlyOnceThreetimes</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have numerous medical conditions throughout my life and I have many friends who are doctors.  All the doctors I have visited have been terrible at their jobs.  Whether it is complete disinterest, misdiagnosis, unknowledgeable of symptoms indicating problems, misreading x-rays/cat scans, etc.  Any condition that has been solved has been me fighting the medical system with information i've researched on the internet.

If we started a database that tracked symptom of patients, eventually we'd see what percentage of particular symptoms indicate a particular disease/condition/disorder/etc.

I understand people do their own research on Web MD and often go to a doctor and a doctor laughs and tells them what they read is incorrect, but this is because WebMD is not considering everything else about the patient.  

For instance low blood pressure in a 24 year old athlete is not an indicator of a problem as it would be for say an old sedentary and obese 65 year old male. 

Doctors should be detectives, puzzle solvers or scientists, but often I find they are quick to get you in and out of your office for that paycheck.  They see too many patience to devote enough time to solve your obscure case.  And let's say it is indeed an obscure case.  Imagine only 100 people have had your condition, no doctor could ever be expected to piece together the puzzle.  But if those 100 people were logged,  the computer could compare against that.

At best we could train individuals to be intermediaries between the patient and the computer system, so training for general practitioners could be lowered considerably.   And in doing so, their pay would be much lower which would allow money to be used for other things.  more testing labs, more MRI machines, etc.

Imagine going into the automated medical facility and getting your blood work and cat-scan done all in one place.  It would seem to me that your chance of a correct diagnosis would be MUCH higher than dealing with a human.  Most of medical school is just learning IMMENSE text book knowledge and analysis skills, both of which are best handled by a computer.

    <text>Can a computer tell when I'm lying or concealing information? Actual question, not rhetorical. Algorithms are only as accurate as the information you're putting into them. If I exaggerate the amount of pain I'm in, or give a noncommittal "uh... yeah" when asked if I always practice safe sex or exercise regularly, and the computer interprets those answers strictly, there's a great risk of misdiagnosis. 

Specifically for the pain example, I feel like that's a recipe for prescription painkiller overuse. We already have a problem there, and I can't imagine that computers right now would do a better job than people at determining how much pain someone actually is in.</text>

    <text>I'd argue that a Doctor wouldn't pry a patient or assume a lie.  If a patient is in the Doctor's office, I'd assume they want to be 'healed' and thus why would a patient lie if they want an accurate diagnosis? 

But this is why someone with lesser training could be available.  A nurse, with less training and less pay (less taxing on medical system finances).

If the intent is to get pain meds or other abused pharmaceuticals, still, a computer could do a better job.  let's say the patient goes to a different doctor's office asking for pain meds.  No record available to the doctor of how many prescriptions he has. 

But a computer would see "This patient has gotte 15 prescriptions for opioids in the past 3 months, could be abusing the system" and this would be mitigated by a nurse.</text>

    <text>You're dramatically over-estimating electronic medical records.  You can go a mile down the road to a different hospital and they'll have basically no access to your medical history if they're not affiliated.</text>

    <text>Regardless of this, I still believe the pros outweigh the cons and this is derailing my view.  My argument isn't whether we SHOULD or if I WANT to implement this system, it is if we CAN.

But to address your point, since you brought it up:

I work in the medical sector and have written a thesis on A.I. bioinformatics, internet security and I am employed as a software engineer.  I really do understand the availability of patient data and security systems.  Centralizing this data is far more secure than spreading it out.  

You are, however, absolutely true that no single hospital will currently have all your patient records; however, your doctor's office would.</text>
