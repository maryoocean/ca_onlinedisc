    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>The term ‘American’ for citizens of the US is rooted in our ‘Manifest Destiny’ desire to control the entire continent. We have fought skirmishes and debated total invasion of both neighbors many times - under the guise that we are *all* Americans,, after all. The same argument used to incorporate every territory expansion since Jefferson. Incidentally, the exact same argument the Soviets always used when invading their neighbors. 

So yes, it would be cool if we (i am a US citizen) came up with another name, and no, the onus would not be on others to come up with this name.</text>
