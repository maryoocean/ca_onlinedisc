    <title>CMV: Life is meaningless, and there's no point to trying to prolong it as much as possible.</title>
    <original_poster>ragdala</original_poster>
    <original_post>Whatever we do, ultimately, has no meaning. In the grand scheme of things, we are but a tiny speck of dust on a meaningless planet.

That's why i say that trying to prolong life is absolutely useless. This includes tries to reanimate dying people, trying to find a special formula for immortality, and similar medical/engineering advances.

Instead of finding ways to prolong life, we could better spend resources to make the life we've got more pleasurable. This would be a much better way to spend our time and resources, by actively trying to become a better and happier society, where death is just part of the cycle, with no taboos attached to it.</original_post>

Why do you reduce us to a tool? We have to decide on our own what our life should be about.

Medical sciences do both. Being alive and being healthy is arguably a prerequisite for pleasure.</text>

    <text>A tool, at least, has a meaning. It is there to serve its makers. A hammer's meaning is to hammer nails to whomever wants them hammered.

If you were to have a meaning such as that one, than you are merely a servant to someone else. And that is just unacceptable to me, because that means that while consciously ypu know you have a purpose, you are willingly giving it away to serve someone else.

That is a selfish and possibly narcissistic point of view, i know. But that is what I'm saying. Ultimately you are only here to serve yourself, burn your existance in as much a pleasurable way as possible, and just leave.</text>

Why can't we relish each moment of our existence? Or what do you mean by "burn"?

&amp;gt;in as much a pleasurable way as possible

No objections here, but I would add that we decide ourselves, at least to some extent, what we find pleasurable.

&amp;gt;, and just leave

Why would we want our existence to end? It's ultimately inevitable, but why cut our life shorter than necessary?

Hm, I don't really understand where you are coming from. Your view is that a happier life is somehow better than a longer life, right? 

I don't really understand why you brought up the meaning of life in that context. Shouldn't everyone decide on their own if they would prefer a shorter and happier or a longer and less happy life?</text>
