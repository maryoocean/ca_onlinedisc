    <title>CMV: Now that we have evolved past the need to eat meat, it is completely immoral to do so.</title>

    <original_post>Not a vegan or even a vegetarian, but I still hold this belief. I understand that we have evolved as carnivores, and that eating meat has always been essential to human survival. It holds nutrients you cant find anywhere else like B12, its heavily saturated which makes it an efficient food, and ot tastes damn good (which i would guess has something to do with evolution aswel).

These arguments are still valid in underdeveloped or poor countries, and under extreme conditions. However, in modern day western society's I can't seem to find one ethical argument for eating meat (not to mention the toll it takes on the environment). 

Is everyone just lazy like me, or is there more to it?</original_post>

    <text>We're the only omnivores (as far as we know) that get together to formulate things like a common codes of ethics,  or get emotionally attached enough to potential prey that we can imagine them suffering and thus be put off eating prey entirely. 

An abundant choice of available food affords the freedom to make ethical choices like this. But in a harsher world, one in which Asda/Walmart are just places for folk to shelter for instance, well things are apt to change. 

And that's what makes omnivores smart motherfuckers - we adapt.
