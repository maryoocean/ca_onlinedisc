    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

*Very typical European arrogance*. You can't fix their behavior because that whole continent is literally infested in Anti-American rhetoric 24/7 (From European media/politicians/population). 

That being said, from what I can tell, people from Latin America disagree with us on how the continents are classified. We view the western hemisphere as North America and South America. Together, we call them "the Americas". But they view it as America.</text>
