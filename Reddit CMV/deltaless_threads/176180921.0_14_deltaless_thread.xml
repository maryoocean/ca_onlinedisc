    <title>CMV: I think atheism is the better path than religion, as it can cause less conflicts</title>
    <original_poster>theraiderofreddit</original_poster>
    <original_post>Today, the world is filled with conflicts between religious groups. People rush to defend their religion, and think of other's religion as inferior. People are fighting wars sorely on the basis of religion, and the recent Charlie Hebdo massacre was done on the grounds of religion.

I am here with an alternate proposal: That of no religion at all, aka atheism. Of course, I don't mean eradication of Religion. That would be impossible. I am just saying that a world without religion would be a world with less conflicts.

One may pose the argument that the institution of religion unites people under a single umbrella, but that ship has passed. There are too many sects, too many divisions too many views for this to be effective. If one is not driven by religion, there would be less chances of conflicts. I don't mean no conflicts at all. 

Conflicts are bound to happen, but religious conflicts are one of the major factors. So why not remove religion from the equation and unlock a more peaceful world?</original_post>

    <text>Religion doesn't cause conflict. Having *different* religions can heat up a conflict. If 100% of the world was Christian, there would be no religious conflict, because everyone agrees. The same could be said for any religion. Atheism isn't special in this case, it's just something that Atheists tend to use to aid their argument a lot.

Religion itself does not cause conflict, *disagreement* causes conflict.

I'll agree that if the entire world holds the same beliefs there would be less conflict, but it doesn't have to be Atheism. It would be no different than the entire world following a certain religion.

The only reason Atheism hasn't "caused wars" is because it's not wide-spread enough. Depending on what study you look at, Atheists only make up about 2-8% of the population. Some say more, some say less, but regardless it's still a small amount. Even at that, there *ARE* cases of Atheist-driven terrorism against countries with high volumes of religious people. An example would be the "radical atheist" suicide bombing that happened in the middle east a while ago. Their motive was (supposedly) religious.</text>
