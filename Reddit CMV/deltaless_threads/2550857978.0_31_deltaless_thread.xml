    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>I used to agree with your post until i actually worked adjacent with police for the duration of 5 years in a manner where they were more relaxed and their guards were down. (Not revealing my profession) and i tell you … the condition is way worse than you can imagine. The police are the largest gang in America and it is a stunning collection of abjectly awful human beings operating under an archaic system that insentivizes negative behaviors. 

During this time my friend started a rotation in conducting psychological evaluations for the PD and i was shocked to learn that their test already has a more aggressive baseline in the areas of psycopathy. As a population there are far more anti-social dispositions than in the average of the population. 

Let’s add on to that our current police system is just a grown up version of the slave catchers they descended from and all throughout the institution are the detritus of white supremacy. 

Zoom out. And we can see internationally that all societal destabilizations in the past 150 years have been a direct result of overpolicing (i.e. arab spring)

My proximity and numerous experiences have lead me to ACAB.</text>
