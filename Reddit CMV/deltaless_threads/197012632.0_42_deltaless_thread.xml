    <title>CMV: Bernie Sanders idea of free college doesn't seem like a good thing.</title>
    <original_poster>mbeogoa</original_poster>
    <original_post>This is probably because I am really bad at understanding politics and don't totally know what Sanders wants to do.  

But the money for free college would come from taxes, correct?  Does that mean that taxes would get raised or that he would just alter around the spending the government does?  Because if taxes are going to get raised that means I have to pay for my own loans that are going to take 10 years plus extra taxes so people can go for free?  That is not fair and while it seems nice, I don't have the money for that.  Nor, I'm sure, do most Americans.  

And what happens with private institutions?  Does that mean through my taxes I am paying for someone to go a $60,000 school when I couldn't go to one myself because I couldn't afford it?  Maybe that seems selfish, but that does not seem fair.  And the government should not be able to force me to pay so other people can get an easier life when I myself did not get that chance.  By the way, I know I am already being forced to pay for things I don't want, but shouldn't we be trying to lessen those instances instead of adding to them?

I mean, on paper his idea sounds great.  Free college, a better educated America, a more economically even country. YAY.  But that doesn't come for free.  And just because I am finally out of school and making a semi-decent wage doesn't mean I should have to pay for other people.  I guess that means I am anti-socialism?  Is there maybe any other way that this could be accomplished?  Like just lessening the cost of college somehow instead of totally free?

    <text>The great thing about Sanders is that he mostly isn't making vague promises, he's actually putting these proposals forward in legislative bills.  You can read a summary of the relevant bill [here](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/collegeforallsummary/?inline=file)

&amp;gt; But the money for free college would come from taxes, correct? Does that mean that taxes would get raised..?

Yes, he would raise a tax, but not on you, probably.  From the summary:

&amp;gt; Fully Paid for by Imposing a Robin Hood Tax on Wall Street.  This
&amp;gt; legislation is offset by imposing a Wall Street speculation fee on
&amp;gt; investment houses, hedge funds, and other speculators of 0.5% on stock
&amp;gt; trades (50 cents for every $100 worth of stock), a 0.1% fee on bonds,
&amp;gt; and a 0.005% fee on derivatives.  It has been estimated that this
&amp;gt; provision could raise hundreds of billions a year which could be used
&amp;gt; not only to make tuition free at public colleges and universities in
&amp;gt; this country, it could also be used to create millions of jobs and
&amp;gt; rebuild the middle class of this country

Back to you:

&amp;gt; And what happens with private institutions? 

This funding would only apply to public colleges and universities.

&amp;gt; I guess that means I am anti-socialism? 

I think it just means you are against raising money for this by increasing taxes across the board.  But there are *many* taxes which could be imposed with almost no effect on people's lives, even the lives of those being taxed.
