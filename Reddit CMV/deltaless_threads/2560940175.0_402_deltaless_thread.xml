    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>The word for someone from the US in French is just Americain. 

The continents are North and South America. So someone from Mexico or Canada could refer to themselves as North American the same way someone from Brazil or Argentina would call themselves South American. There is no continent of “America,” that’s simply a country.

Do these outraged Germans subscribe to the 6 or 7 continent model? If they view the Americas as 2 separate continents, then they’re extra stupid. If they believe the 6 continent model, they’re insane but at least intellectually consistent.</text>
