    <title>CMV: Some people want companies to pay a carbon tax, others do not. I believe the best compromise is an optional carbon tax.</title>
    <original_poster>antilisterine</original_poster>
    <original_post>There are people who care about climate change who want companies to pay a carbon tax - well they can pressure companies to prove that they're environmentally friendly and they can do that by paying the optional carbon tax. It's like they're saying, hey, we care so much about the environment, that we're willing to pay a tax that we don't even have to pay.

However those who don't care about climate change can remain unaffected by it - they can buy products and use services from companies that refused to pay the optional carbon tax. Also, as I've mentioned before, I don't believe that disadvantaged people should be forced to thank society for treating them like shit or be forced to help people with good lives whilst their lives are miserable - in this scenario, they have a choice. These people can choose not to support companies that pay the optional carbon tax so that way they're not thanking society, they're not helping people with good lives and they can remain completely unaffected by it.

It just seems like a win-win situation to me. So why can't we fight for an optional carbon tax instead? I see literally no problems with it.

    <text>The companies that would immediately pay the optional tax are probably the ones that already care about this and are already working out their enviromental issues.. the "Optional carbon tax" you're proposing, which is strongly based on the "pressure from the environmentally aware consumer base", already exist.. it just isn't a formal TAX, but more a reality of marketing and doing business in this day and age.. The companies that would imediatelly pay an optional carbon tax are already doing it on their own. All those reforestation and enviromental programs you see big companies engaging in are exactly that.. an optional tax will change nothing at all.. companies that currently invest in social responsibility programs will keep doing it and those who don't will keep ignoring it (and not paying the tax)..

Suddenly creating an optional tax will not change the current mindset of any company. </text>
