    <title>I think reddit has misinterpreted the purpose of the White House petition website. CMV.</title>
    <original_poster>feartrich</original_poster>
    <original_post>The purpose of the "We the People" website is so the federal government can keep tabs on what people are concerned about. Modeled after similar sites like those that governments in the EU have set up, it's a new way for citizens to interact with the government and vice versa. It's an easy way for the executive branch to keep track of the zeitgeist without using too much in the way of PR resources.

The purpose of the website is so you can voice your concerns. If there's enough attention given by users to one concern, then someone will listen and respond. That's it. The White House has *never* indicated that any of these petitions would affect real policy. Never.

In fact, it's not that far from petitions have traditionally worked. Civil petitions are just a formal request and show of solidarity; on their own, they are rarely effective at directly influencing policy.

So in that sense, the "We the People" website is far from the farce that /r/worldnews or /r/politics proclaims it to be.

    <text>True, but I wish the White House would follow up on its response promise. It claims it will respond to petitions that reach 100,000 signatures, but the last one was about the Postal Service, quite a while ago.

 I remember reddit complaining about the petitions website last summer, when they neglected the "pardon Edward Snowden" petition despite meeting the criteria. Even if they didn't decide to pardon him, I'd still like a response as promised.</text>
