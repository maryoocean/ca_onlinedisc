    <title>cmv: Canada should install dirty atomic bombs in each big lake as an invasion deterrent.</title>
    <original_poster>maxi1134</original_poster>
    <original_post>With the upcoming climate changes and the fact that Canada has 20% of the freshwater reserve in the world. Russia, America, and other states might have an interest in invading Canada to access the water reserves and the Canadian north that will taw out and become available for crops.    
  

With this information, I believe that rigging the water table to be radioactive for eons in case of invasion would be the perfect deterrent to prevent the invasion from any other state.   

  

Especially America, as their water table would then also be contaminated</original_post>

    <text>Economics alone defends this water.  The cost of a war is greater than the cost of desalination systems. 

Also, if a country did attempt to take the water by force &amp; Canada did make their water radioactive, that would hurt Canadians more than it would hurt the invading force.  The invaders would go elsewhere &amp; the Canadians would just die.</text>
