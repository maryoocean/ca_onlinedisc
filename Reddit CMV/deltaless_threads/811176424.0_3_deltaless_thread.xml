    <title>CMV: Joker was nowhere near as violent as the news claimed</title>
    <original_poster>buddamus</original_poster>
    <original_post>I did enjoy the film and liked the way they did his origin story (there are many in the comics).

But the media gave unrealistic expectations of the violence, I thought it was average and not 'terrifying' at all.
There was no 'gore' lile in something like Saw or anything over sexual

I think the media is being dishonest possibly even encouraged to hype it up to boost ticket sales

The French film Irr√©versible is what I would consider an overwhelming violent film and Joker did not come close to that.

CMV: Its not a particularly violent film and the media is hyping it up for no reason</original_post>

    <text>If your barometer for "too violent" starts at a French film so renowned for its violence that it is credited with starting a movement of *extreme* films, then I would suggest maybe your scale is completely broken. You're comparing an experimental movie with a **10 min** rape scene to a mainstream block buster.  If Joker were as violent as that movie, something would be seriously, devastatingly wrong. Maybe try comparing apples to apples - Is Joker more violent than Logan?</text>

    <text>Could only compare films I have seen, haven't seen Logan

What about Robocop?

That was quite violent</text>

    <text>Joker is less violent than both Robocop and Logan.</text>

    <text>But again, Robocop was cartoonish, and deliberately so (poking fun at American culture in the process). The violence in *Joker* is realistic, and Phoenix's performance renders an additional layer of realism; I really *believed* his mad anger in those scenes, where other depictions of similar violence in, say, a mafia movie, just felt like performances.</text>

    <text>Isn't the point of good acting to be real when needed?</text>

    <text>Of course, and that's why Phoenix is already getting Oscar buzz. But it also makes this film more disturbing than something like *Robocop*, even though the objectvive level of violence is lower.</text>
