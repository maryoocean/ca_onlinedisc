    <title>CMV: a better way to pay for college would be a wage percentage system</title>
    <original_poster>SaltySpursSupporter</original_poster>
    <original_post>instead of needing to take out thousands of dollars for student loans, maybe this is a better idea. instead of needing to pay money outright, negotiate a percentage of your future wage. depending on the program you're entering and the amount of years in that system, you can negotiate the percentage and the amount of years. if the person has a minimum wage job for the chosen amount of years, that's still all they get. i'm sure there are problems here that I haven't thought of. you're welcome to change my mind.</original_post>

    <text>There are [schools that do this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/12/21/6-schools-that-dont-require-tuition-until-you-get-a-job.html) but they only offer computer science degrees.

I have a hard time believing it would work for all majors. A school needs to be able to balance their budget like any other business and letting students choose less-lucrative majors seems risky for them.</text>

    <text>Hence why you wouldnâ€™t let people choose less lucrative ones.</text>
