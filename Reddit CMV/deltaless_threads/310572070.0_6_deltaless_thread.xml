    <title>CMV: Every straight girl out there secretly wants to date a rich guy</title>
    <original_poster>windmill230</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let's be honest here. Some girls say that they have no desire to date rich guys as they are looking for true love but really they are just lying. And as for girls who don't pursue rich guys, they secretly want to do this and the only reason why they did not do this is because they know that rich guys are out of their league.

Some people say that money is not a priority but really it is. Who doesn't want a rich husband who treats you nicely? "Money cannot buy happiness" is just a myth propagated by not-so-well-off people with a sour grapes mindset. The truth is deep down, everyone values money and secretly desires to be rich. I don't believe it when a girl says that she has no particular desire to date rich guys.

    <text>It's seems like you're calling sour-grapes on relationships in general. 

Let's be honest, have you ever actually been in a good relationship with a woman? Because if you have, you would know at least one straight girl who wouldn't ditch you for the next best thing. 

Rather than admit to having a rough dating life, you call out all women as selfish and shallow just to make yourself feel better. It's a bit ridiculous though since there are plenty of men and women who have had lifelong fulfilling relationships with money playing no part in their decision-making. 

Here's some perspective... 

Would you want to date a supermodel? 

If you say yes, consider that modeling is a life-consuming job that leads to a load of mental stress and physical ailments like anorexia and body dysmorphia for the poor woman. Are you actually prepared to deal with all of these problems or do you just in it to have a trophy to show off to your friends?   

Can you understand that dating a rich guy has its own list of problems and while some women would just to chance, there are still many who just don't want to deal with that drama. </text>
