    <title>CMV: Bodybuilding is stupid</title>
    <original_poster>RaindropDripDropTop</original_poster>
    <original_post>I want to be clear, I'm not talking about lifting weights in general, I'm specifically referring to competitive bodybuilding, especially when it involves cycling a bunch of gear (using PEDs), and getting to dangerously low body fat levels and severe dehydration to go on stage.  

I definitely recognize that competitive bodybuilders have insane levels of dedication and training. It is without doubt incredibly difficult to achieve those type of physiques, even for people with top tier genetics who use PEDs. Even the most genetically blessed and steroid enhanced bodybuilders still work insanely hard. I am not doubting their work ethic and drive. What I think is stupid about it is why do people think that this is worth it. 

For starters, it is purely for the sake of vanity rather than athleticism or strength. A bodybuilder might look absolutely insane, but functionally speaking, actual athletes who train to maximize athletic ability have way more physical capability depending on what sport they train for. Whether it's strength, speed, endurance, acceleration, vertical leap, flexibility, dexterity, or a combination of all these things, bodybuilders just aren't nearly as physically capable as actual athletes who put in similar time and effort into their training.

On the topic of vanity, bodybuilder physiques don't even look attractive or aesthetically pleasing. Obviously this is subjective, but the vast majority of the population is way more attracted to a healthy athletic physique than they are to a bodybuilder physique. I get that bodybuilding isn't really about looking attractive, rather it is about pushing the limits of what is possible with the human body, but it's honestly kind of just a freak show.

The biggest reason bodybuilding is stupid is that it is insanely unhealthy. Even for natural bodybuilders who don't use PEDs, they are still getting to dangerously low body fat levels and becoming extremely dehydrated in order to achieve their stage physique. This is incredibly taxing on the body, and it's extremely common for bodybuilders to suffer severe health issues because of this. For the ones who do use PEDs, which is basically a requirement to become a top level bodybuilder, the damage to health is even more severe, and they suffer many side effects as a result, especially ones who are not properly educated on the drugs they are taking.

One might argue that bodybuilding might be worth it for the money, but the reality is that only the top few bodybuilders in the world are making significant money through this career. The vast majority of bodybuilders, especially amateurs and people who do regional or local shows, aren't actually making much if any money through this. They also have to dedicate insane amount of time and effort into training, and if they are using gear, they are spending a ton of money on drugs. Moreover, there are similar alternatives to bodybuilding that are way more lucrative and more accessible to most people, such as becoming a fitness influencer or something (not saying that many people can break into that field either, but it's more achievable than making money through competitive bodybuilding).

The reason I am asking for my view to be changed is because I want to hear opposing perspectives, and maybe someone can shed some light on what I am missing. Like I said, I respect the work ethic and drive of bodybuilders, I just have a really hard time wrapping my head around it. I totally respect people's rights to do whatever they want with their body so long as they aren't harming others, I'm really just trying to understand the mindset of a bodybuilder, or at least understand what the appeal is.</original_post>

    <text>Is it always self destructive? Or just taken to an extreme? I just fail to see how paying attention to your diet and exercising is self destructive unless it’s taken to an extreme. Idk</text>

    <text>Yes, having a dangerously low body fat percentage and dehydration is always self destructive 

I'm not talking about paying attention to diet and exercise, I'm talking about competitive bodybuilding</text>

    <text>Okay competitive bodybuilding is super destructive, totally agreed. 

Thanks for answering though. Rare to see an OP actually engage meaningfully</text>

    <text>Ok like if someone sacrifices their lung health to run into a burning building and save a bunch of children, obviously that would be worthy. 

But we're not talking about a situation like that, we're talking about competitive bodybuilding, which is mostly just people with body dysmorphia competing in a vanity show. I don't really see why that would be considered a worthy cause</text>

    <text>It doesn’t matter that you don’t see why it’s a worthy cause. It is the case that other people *do* find it worthy. How can you possibly tell them that they’re wrong? It might be the case that they’re unaware of the health effects of steroids (which is definitely the case oftentimes) so they aren’t making an accurate assessment, but most bodybuilders know the health effects, the lack of money in bodybuilding, and the fact that they’re not athletic or “functional”. If they still determine that it’s a worthwhile pursuit when considering all the factors, how would you convince them that they’re wrong?</text>

    <text>I don't see how bodybuilding is really that much different than anorexia. In both cases it is people with body dysmorphia starving themselves and doing harm to their bodies because they want to look a certain way. I don't see why this should be encouraged or celebrated</text>

There are lots of bodybuilders that are **very** transparent about the negative health effects of competitive bodybuilding, both physical and mental.

&gt;I don't see how bodybuilding is really that much different than anorexia. In both cases it is people with body dysmorphia starving themselves and doing harm to their bodies because they want to look a certain way.

I can understand why you'd draw the comparison between anorexia and competitive bodybuilding, and there's definitely an important conversation to be had about mental health amongst competitive bodybuilders (this is something that seems to be discussed more these days amongst bodybuilders). However, I'm not sure your comparison is entirely appropriate. Those suffering from anorexia don't have a "goal" they work towards, they have an unhealthy eating habit due to warped body image Bodybuilders only diet and take drugs because it's a necessity to do well in competition, and as soon as the competition is over and their goal achieved, they're more than happy to start eating a less restricted diet. Again, it is absolutely the case that some bodybuilders suffer from unhealthy eating habits and a warped body image, but it's not at all a universal. There's lots of bodybuilders out there who treat the sport like a job, and do what's necessary to succeed. 

You or I may not deem it worth it to go on an extreme diet and take harmful drugs to make our muscles look bigger and more conditioned, but if someone else does, how could we possibly tell them that their values are skewed?</text>

Yes, I agree. And just because they are transparent and self aware doesn't mean that bodybuilding isn't stupid 

&gt;I can understand why you'd draw the comparison between anorexia and competitive bodybuilding

Especially considering that bodybuilding is all about getting to dangerously low body fat levels and cutting down on fat to the point of being unhealthy, it basically is a form of anorexia. The only real difference is that bodybuilding adds this obsession with building lean muscle tissue as well, and is usually accompanied by use of PEDs to achieve the absolute most freakishly jacked physique.

Just because bodybuilders are goal oriented doesn't mean what they are doing isn't just as unhealthy as what anorexic people are doing. If anything, bodybuilding is worse in some ways, especially these guys that are on a shit ton of gear.</text>
