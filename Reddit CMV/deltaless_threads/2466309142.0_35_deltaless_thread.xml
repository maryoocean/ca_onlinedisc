    <title>CMV: I hate America with a burning passion</title>
    <original_poster>HoovyKitty</original_poster>
    <original_post> I am a European and I've visited America for a couple of weeks before (east coast) but I just hate America and a lot of American's for some reason. The joke here has always been that American's are fat and stupid, but I always took that joke with a grain of salt, but ever since I vistied, I've believed that statement and agreed with it fully. I hate all of the food in America and how it's bland and fattening, I hate Americans all over the internet treating America like the center of the world, I hate it when I google something and the results are about America instead of the world, I also hate the stupid (to me) measurements like pounds (written lbs??) feet, inches, miles and whatnot. Also, I don't get their obsession with guns, I've never understood how they can have so many shootings, and I get that it's a massive country, but compared to the entirety of Europe it's still insane. The thing is, there are countries in Europe and elsewhere that have way more things that I dislike about them, hell, even my own country sucks, everyone here is depressed, hates themselves and hates eachother and we still suffer from Russian influence, but for some reason America just makes me want to make fun of it and hate it way more.</original_post>

    <text>An issue may be expense. Really good food here is by either regional taste or very expensive. It's true that here often quantity trumps quality. We, as a people, are too fat, a fact. 

We, as a people, do have a culture of gun worshipping and violence. 

Historically, America went around the world suppressing democracy on behalf of corporations, then, while suppressing voting rights at home, wants to lecture the world on the virtues of democracy.

In Europe, people get things for their taxes that are socialism here. While we lecture the world on free markets, taxpayers are subsidizing Walmart shareholders by paying for welfare assistance for their employees.

The level of American hubris and hypocrisy is staggering. I think that's the most off-putting cultural quality the world hates, while loving America as (once) a land of opportunity, a golden city on a hill.</text>
