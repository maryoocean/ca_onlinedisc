    <title>CMV:I believe torture to be perfectly ok if guilt is established beyond reasonable doubt.</title>
    <original_poster>Disgustingoldslob</original_poster>
    <original_post>Simple as the title, I believe that if someone is guilty of a serious crime against another (rape, murder, child abuse, etcetc) the victim or the family of the victim should be legally allowed to torture the guilty party as part of the punishment. I do not believe doing so lowers you to the level of the guilty, as you would be acting out violence on someone who harmed an innocent, while they were completely unjustified in their actions. I also do not believe the moral objections of others should interfere with the legal right of the family/victim.

Edit for clarification, I don't believe it should be mandatory, but I believe it should be an available option. I'm speaking of cases in which guilt is almost perfectly assured. (e.g sound witness testimony, DNA, caught in the act, admission of guilt, etc.)

    <text>There are things we shouldn't put into relative perspective for the safety of humankind. Torture is that league. Why torture someone, for instance, who killed your son? For pleasure (revenge this a form of pleasure)? Well, that is why cold blood killers do kill or rape: they kind like that. There is no gain on that. It won't bring the kid back. It will only turn you a monster as your offender. 

In order to us as a society be able to condemn a torturer/killer with a light soul and a conviction in mind we must not commit the same mistake they did. It is important (in my mindset) for us be able to tell a criminal by our laws "What you did is so inhumane, so wrong, although we feel the urge to do the same to you we will not do it. We won't commit the same atrocity you did to us."</text>

    <text>We wouldn't be committing the same mistake they did, they would have done something unthinkable to an individual who did nothing to deserve it, in the cases I mention. Doing something to them would not even come close to being the same. There is no way of substantiating that someone who is otherwise an upstanding person who physically harms a murderer/rapist/child abuser etc would continue to commit crimes or "become a monster", and no reason it should not be treated as an isolated incident. I tend to view morality as subjective, and I don't think it is the place of outsiders to judge the actions of someone who, in your example, lost a loved one to a criminal.</text>
