    <title>CMV most modern medical advances have come from companies looking to profit in the American medical system, and if America were to switch to a European style system then progress would slow worldwide</title>

    <original_post>I say this without a ton of knowledge about the recent history of medical advances, but it seems to me that most modern medical companies don’t see much money to be made in socialist systems. While they will take the profits they can get there, if America were to switch as well medical advancement would stall (with the advantage that the current top quality of care would be widely available)

I am fully aware that there are numerous inefficiencies in our healthcare system unrelated to capitalist/socialist systems but that isn’t the subject here


Thanks </original_post>

    <text>Canada and European countries have made plenty of medical advances, America isn't the only country that has contributed to medical knowledge worldwide. Additionally, our system is fundamentally broken in many areas and the cost of that is people's lives and livelihood, should we avoid reforming the system and leave these people to die in exchange for hypothetical future medical advancements that we may or may not make? </text>

    <text>Yes but are those companies targeting their local market/ do they make most of their money locally? That’s the key question here</text>
