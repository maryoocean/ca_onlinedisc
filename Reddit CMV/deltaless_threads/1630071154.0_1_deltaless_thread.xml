    <title>CMV: Sell-side equity research is useless to retail investors to beat the market</title>
    <original_poster>BAIIIPLUS</original_poster>
    <original_post>What is the value of information for investors? The most valuable information to generate superior return is getting inside information. However, it is not usually available and you will be prosecuted if you trade on such information.

In addition to traditional media, brokers offer sell-side equity research. I don't think is is useful for retail investors to generate return above index.

1. Accuracy of recommendation  
 No one knows the future price. I don't see sufficient evidence to believe an analyst can accurately predict the future price. If he/she has such a predictive power, he/she should've quitted the job and made money by his/herself.
2. Knowledge  
 Some people may argue that we can accumulate knowledge reading sell-side equity research. However, could you generate superior return above index by knowing more? I don't think so because what you learned is already known by other rich investors who would have more significant influence on market prices.

Therefore, sell-side equity research is useless to retail investors to beat the market. They are marketing materials of brokers. To beat the market, there are more important factors than information from brokers such as investment experience and mental control.</original_post>

    <text>if used alone, trends might not predict the future, but with more data sets you can plot an average trend, and most things are surprisingly stable, so while its not a sure thing it is however a safer bet</text>

    <text>Thank you for being the first person to post comment. I appreciate your opinion.  
I agree with the point that combination of multiple economic indicators can better predict future macroeconomic trend. However, my point is whether equity research on individual stocks can help you to beat the market. It involves the management of idiosyncratic risks so I would like to set macroeconomic prediction (systematic risk) aside.</text>
