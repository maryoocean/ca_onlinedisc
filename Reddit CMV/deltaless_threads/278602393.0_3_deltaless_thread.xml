    <original_post>Hey all - 

Just a heads up that DeltaBot is currently on extended vacation, but should be back soon.  In the meantime, he isn't scanning for newly awarded deltas.  If you received a delta and didn't get credit, please send the modertators a message with a permalink to the comment in question, and we'll take care of it. 

Thanks!</original_post>
