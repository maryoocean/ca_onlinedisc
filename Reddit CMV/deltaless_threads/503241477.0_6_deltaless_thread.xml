    <title>CMV: People should not be able to choose a religion until they reach the age of legal adulthood</title>
    <original_poster>PsychoticSoul</original_poster>
    <original_post>Children are about as impressionable as it gets, and getting religious instruction from their parents is, in my opinion, tantamount to brainwashing at the age where they are most susceptible.

Choosing a religion requires the same responsible, mature mind that allows one to vote, drive, drink, choose a political affiliation, etc - so why must those wait until adulthood, but religion can effectively be forced on the young?

By my suggestion I mean:

Instruction regarding religion in all schools must be multi-denominational and as wide as possible, such that a person can make as informed a decision as possible upon reaching adulthood on what path they wish to take.

Religious schools can only accept adults - those who have made the conscious decision to go there.

No religious rituals such as baptism until willingly chosen as an adult.

    <text>People who actually take their religion seriously essentially consider providing religious knowledge to be education. Matters of choice are not particularly important in the same way they wouldn't really care that much about avoiding teaching them scientific facts or language skills as long as it doesn't approach an uncomfortable topic.

Children, whether or not they are highly impressionable, cannot avoid the desire of adults to indoctrinate them. Doesn't need religion to be involved. Pride and obedience to their nation is a standard procedure to try and make them have. Respect and love for their parents is something that they are told to have on principle. Even without direct attempts to have them think a certain way, movies, games, books, the internet, any socialization will impact what they know and could believe in.</text>
