    <title>I dont think manslaughter or any crime committed accidentally should be considered a crime. At all. CMV</title>

    <original_post>If it is proven that the offender had no intention of committing a crime, why should they be persecuted because the odds were against them? 


EDIT: Ok, many people have used the example of "what if a person is driving drunk and they kill someone?" I still think they should only be punished for driving drunk.</original_post>

    <text>I'm partial to restitutive theory on punishment (when restitution is reasonably possible, so ignore the manslaughter thing for now), so intent is sort of irrelevant when we're concerned with undoing the damage done to the victim.

If restitution isn't reasonably possible, though, I think I'm more partial to preventative punishment. And the preventative justification for punishing manslaughter is that if someone knows that manslaughter will be punished, they'll try harder to avoid it.</text>
