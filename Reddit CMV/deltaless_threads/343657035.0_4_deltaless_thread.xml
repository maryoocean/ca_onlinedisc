    <title>CMV: U.S. Expenditures on defense is why there is so few terrorist attacks</title>

    <original_post>On Reddit the U.S. gets a lot of flak for spending so much on its defense budget. People often use the argument "[some uncommon event] kills more people a year than terrorists." I argue that this is because of our massive intelligence and military capabilities. Another hot button issue on Reddit seems to be the use of drones and many will argue that our drone program makes more enemies than it kills. Although I do recognize the flaws with our drone program I believe stopping is not a solution and the drone program weakens the capabilities of terrorists networks to effectively plan attacks. I subscribe to the "peace means carrying a big stick" philosophy. Change my view on American defense spending and drones.  </original_post>

    <text>I'm not going to disagree that having a big military is important, just the statement that because we have a big military we do not have terrorist attacks. I think that the situation that America is in (and Europe) in regards to terrorism is from having such a large military (I include our extensive abilities to arm insurgents as part of our military). Unlike a country like Mexico, we are in a position to enforce our interests across the globe. Decades of this happening in the Middle East has created a lot of terrorists, who in turn, may be stopped by our military. 

So i agree that our large military helps keep terrorists at bay, but it is also from the use of our large military that we have terrorists interested in us at all.</text>
