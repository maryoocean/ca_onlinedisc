    <title>CMV: "White trash" is an offensive slur, and should not be tolerated in society just as we do not tolerate other bigoted slurs.</title>
    <original_poster>JSmurfington</original_poster>
    <original_post>This has bothered me for a while. The term "white trash" or "trailer trash" fits all the criteria for being a slur which should not be widely acceptable for use. But I have heard the term dropped casually in conversation, and no one seems to treat it like the slur that it is.

It is a term that denigrates and stereotypes a group of people based on their race, appearance, and socioeconomic status. It is meant to be derogatory. This to me is the definition of a bigoted term.

I'm not arguing that the term has as much history behind it as other racial or bigoted slurs. But in our modern society, we should still abandon the term altogether.

    <text>I would go one step further to say that WORDS and name calling ought not be "not tolerated" in society. People should allow others to say what they want -- be it bigoted or not -- and the decision to say them or not should come from a deep personal conviction and individual moral compass. 

So, to yourself, you should tell yourself not to use phrases you think are hurtful. But if you do say them, *I* should say to *myself* that it's no big deal. It's just words. 

The whole premise of societal allowances on phrases to say or not say is based on nothing but trends and whims that have no real relevance to what's right and not right. </text>
