    <title>CMV: Public sector unions should be abolished.</title>
    <original_poster>Full-Initiative3926</original_poster>
    <original_post>Despite the support that unions enjoy on Reddit, they are just as corrupt as the corporations they negotiate against. Power corrupts whether that power is in the hands of a CEO commanding a million dollar company or in a union president commanding millions in union dues. Unions are often a necessary evil, not necessarily a force for good. 

For example, Jimmy Hoffa was one of the most corrupt union leaders of all time. It was his explicit goal to bring all logistics workers into the Teamsters Union so he could control the shipping of all goods within the U.S. and charge monopoly rates. This had the secondary effect of raising wages, but really his goal was to increase union dues so he could invest those dues into Las Vegas casinos run by his connections in organized crime. 

Jimmy Hoffa was a bad man, but the damage he could do was ultimately limited because if the organizations his union members worked for went out of business, his party would be over as well. This is where the dangers of public sector unions become apparent. 

Public unions, like police unions and teacher unions, have the same ability to hold their organizations hostage, but because the public sector cannot “go out of business” the damage they can do to their organizations and the tax payer is unlimited. 

Furthermore, unlike private sector unions where workers are unlikely to have any stock or say in governance, all public sector union members are able to vote in the elections governing their organizations like any other citizen. 

Public sector unions should be abolished. Union leaders are susceptible to corruption. Public sector union power is not checked by bankruptcy. Public union members have a governing stake in their organizations so unions are much less necessary.</original_post>

You do realize that nearly every publicly traded company offers stock options and stock purchase plans to employees, right?</text>

    <text>Yes, I am aware that some companies do that for certain groups of employees. Most often it’s the management class that gets stock options to align the interests of management and shareholders. Amazon warehouse workers stopped receiving stock options when the pay increases to $15/hour. Private workers, especially the ones more likely to need a union, typically do not own stock. I would say that’s it’s probably not good for a regular worker to own their company’s stock as they should diversify their investments. 

There is still a financial barrier to entry in the private sector.</text>

    <text>Stock (via discounted purchase plans, RSUs and options) is a fairly common perk for office workers,  not just management.

You won't see too many warehouse workers with Amazon stock,  but you'll see plenty of Amazon IT and developers with stock.</text>
