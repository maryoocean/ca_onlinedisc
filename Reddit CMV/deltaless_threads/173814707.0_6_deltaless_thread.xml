    <title>CMV: Focusing too narrowly on the plot of movies is a shallow way of experiencing and critiquing them</title>
    <original_poster>sloggz</original_poster>
    <original_post>Often when I see movie criticism, either on Reddit or in person, I see people focusing on critiquing the plot of films. They'll say things like "the story was great, up until *blank* and then it totally ruined it for me". There is also a general focus on spoilers, plot holes, etc.


Now, I don't think there is necessarily anything wrong with people viewing film this way, I just think it's shallow. And I don't mean shallow in a wholly negative way, I just mean it as exactly as it is, shallow, close to the surface, without depth.


Films, as an art-form are an immensely complex and intriguing form of entertainment. They combine all the aspects of music, photography, writing, performing, digital effects and art, set design and sound production into an end result that can often be greater than the sum of its parts. To reduce all of these aspects of film to just the narrative of the story and the literal events of the movie is to ignore and not appreciate a massive part of the experience.


Not that plot isn't an important part of movies. I love movies with complex, interesting plots, but I also love movies without them. A complex narrative is in no way, a pre-requisit to a good movie. Just as it's not a requirement for a good novel or anything. It helps, and it can add to or make a good film even great, but it is not all there is.


Basically, my view is that modern mainstream critiquing of movies - what your family members discuss after leaving the cinema, or what people say around the water-cooler at work, (or what is often said in discussion posts of films at /r/movies, is far too focused on the plot of movies. Movie fans everywhere are doing themselves a disservice and would enjoy the movies they watch more if they changed the way they thought about them.


I equate it to people judging music solely on the lyrics.


So! please, try to change my view, as I am clearly in the minority. Why would it not be better for general audiences in general to be more well-rounded film viewers?

    <text>The driving force behind any mainstream movie is the plot. There isn't a mainstream movie where this isn't the case and if someone does go see a movie where this isn't the case then they're usually well aware what they're getting into beforehand.

All of the other things about the movie, good or bad, are all tied together via the thread of the movie's plot, so it's not really shallow of someone to say the ending of Vanilla Sky ruined the movie as a whole.

Sure someone might be missing out on something else that's worthy of appreciation if they let themselves get too wrapped up in the plot but that's sort of a pointless observation more than it is a view to be changed.

If only a moral vegetarian could relax their stance for a moment they'd be able to appreciate how delicious barbecue is. If only the kid could get over his fear of heights he'd appreciate how exhilarating a roller coaster can be, etc.

And if you ask someone who deems a movie bad, to pick apart certain things they liked about it, I'm sure they could. But their decision that it's ultimately a bad movie because of failings in the plot despite stellar acting doesn't make them shallow.

What would be an example of a non shallow method of deeming a movie bad in your opinion. What if the concept, lighting design, plot, dialogue, were all beautiful but the acting was terrible? Is that something you should be able to look past too? </text>
