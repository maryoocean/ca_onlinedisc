    <title>CMV: The campaigning to discourage shopping on Thanksgiving is not necessarily the morally correct thing to do.</title>
    <original_poster>championofobscurity</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've seen and heard several times this week the phrase "If I'm shopping on Thanksgiving someone is working." I don't think this campaign stands justified on it's own for several reasons.

1.) It assumes 100% of people don't want to work on Thanksgiving, and is a discredit to the people who do want to work as a minority.

2.) It assumes everyone celebrates Thanksgiving or has someone to celebrate it with. For some people this can be just another day as any other, and so the holiday inconveniences these folks at the very least.

3.) Tearing away those two things, It also may not get in the way of the holiday for the people who do and want to celebrate for them to work, and they get some nifty or needed holiday pay for their trouble meaning that it's not always a net negative for people that do have to work.

To conclude, the campaigning not to shop on Thanksgiving is not necessarily inherently righteous or positive, and from a moral standpoint might even be negatively affecting the lives of certain people if it gains any ground with the general public.

    <text>I've been the single guy who was away from family on Thanksgiving. It sucks when it comes to who will work the holiday because everyone looks to you to take a shift because they have families and you don't. It places you in a really bad spot if you still want to holiday off. There were times I said yes because I knew that there would lots of resentment if I said no because I didn't have family in town. 

 So in addition to having no family dinner to look forward to, I now have to work or get guilt tripped by those with families? just so I can a few bucks more to deal with all the stressed holiday shoppers doing things last minute and then telling me about all the fun they will have while I'm stuck at work thinking about my family hundreds of miles away.

I'd rather not.
