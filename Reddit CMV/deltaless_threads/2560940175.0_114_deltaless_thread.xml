    <title>cmv: There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as an “American”</title>

    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>The only people who get pissy about this are predominately Latin Americans who arbitrarily hate the USA and everyone in it, so, despite there being no such thing as a continental North/South American identity, they assert there is to try to demand Americans not call themselves Americans. It's literally a stupid ass argument, and nobody will convince me otherwise.</text>

    <text>I 100% am on board with having absolute distrust and disdain for the CIA's activities in Latin America throughout the Cold War. From a government perspective, the US did such an ass job down there, it's a wonder we still have any security or economic partners there. ***However***, the inability to separate that distrust of the government from the people, and the insistence on trying to strip the American populace of their national identity while bemoaning having had that exact same thing done to your (or attempted to be done) is peak hypocrisy in my book.</text>
