    <title>CMV: a better way to pay for college would be a wage percentage system</title>
    <original_poster>SaltySpursSupporter</original_poster>
    <original_post>instead of needing to take out thousands of dollars for student loans, maybe this is a better idea. instead of needing to pay money outright, negotiate a percentage of your future wage. depending on the program you're entering and the amount of years in that system, you can negotiate the percentage and the amount of years. if the person has a minimum wage job for the chosen amount of years, that's still all they get. i'm sure there are problems here that I haven't thought of. you're welcome to change my mind.</original_post>

    <text>Wouldn’t that effectively be a college tax that you pay to the college? In that taxes are paid as a percentage of your wage, I mean. And if that’s already (sort of) a tax, why not use the existing tax system, avoiding the additional bureaucratic overhead of another tax office?</text>

    <text>It’s a tax that doesn’t last as long and can be individually negotiated. So I would venture to call it more of a business deal than a tax.</text>

    <text>Incentive. If the government taxes you and pays the college for your attendance, the leadership of that school is incentivized to get students to apply and enroll.

If the school "taxes" you based on income, then it's incentivized to boost graduation and income post graduation for students.

Note that a potentially unintended consequence is that this could hurt majors that don't have a high projected salary. We should consider having the option for paying upfront, or direct government assistance specifically for public schools, so that people have the option and freedom to study what they want.</text>
