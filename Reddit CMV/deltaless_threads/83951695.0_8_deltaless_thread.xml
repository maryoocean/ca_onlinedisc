    <text>[we produce more than enough food to feed everyone in the world right now](http://www.worldhunger.org/articles/Learn/world%20hunger%20facts%202002.htm). when people go hungry it is because they lack the ability to pay for food. it is a problem of economics, not production. so why would you change the populace to match the economics instead of changing the economics to match the populace?</text>
