    <title>CMV: Every Disney Princess could be reasonably interpreted as a metaphor for mental illness or diagnosed as having one</title>
    <original_poster>DaisyChained23</original_poster>
    <original_post>Examples:

Belle- Stockholm Syndrome. Also maybe NPD (the scene where the villages are singing about how beautiful and special she is could be seen as a grandiose delusion).

Rapunzel - Anxiety (her "tower" is a mental one) and PTSD from an abusive mother.

Elsa and Anna- BPD. Anna is impulsive and reckless and doesn't really have a clear sense of identity. Elsa is impulsive in a different way and cold. They could be seen as two sides of "splitting".

Ariel- body dysphoria. She literally changes the entire lower half of her body.</original_post>

    <text>I think we really abuse the phrase “mental illness”.  It’s hard enough as a fuzzy term that refers to behavioral classifications on a spectrum, rather than a thing you can actually conclusively *test* for... but the implication of the phrase is *debilitating*.  If you stretch the definition beyond that, literally any personality trait could be given a label.

Any good story involves the protagonist overcoming internal and external adversity and growing as an a person.</text>
