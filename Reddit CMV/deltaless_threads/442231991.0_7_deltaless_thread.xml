    <title>CMV: Christianity is held together through fear</title>
    <original_poster>M1STER_B0NES</original_poster>
    <original_post>My opinion is that if the fear of going to Hell was not present in the Christian ideology, then most of the followers of the religion would not be there.

Before I decided I was agnostic, that was my only reason for continuing to identify with the religion. Then, I decided I wasn't going to let fear control me. 

All in all, I don't see how this is any different than blackmailing a person to do what you want. You present your instruction, then tell them how you will completely devastate their life if they do not follow through.</original_post>

    <text>If I remember correctly, hell isn't mentioned in the Bible. There are many Christians that don't believe in a devil either. I'm a Christian because I was raised that way, and I believe it to be true.</text>

    <text>The Bible does mention a devil, but the only reference to a burning hell is in the heavily symbolic, not literal, book of Revelations.</text>

    <text>Jesus refers a few times to Hell in metaphorical terms. He calls it "the darkness outside", "fiery gehenna", and a place where there is "wailing and gnashing of teeth."

He also describes the punishments for sinners (particularly those he says bear greater responsibility) in comparative metaphors, such as "it would better for him if he had never been born," and comparison to being thrown into sea with a giant stone tied to your neck.

Satan is mentioned, too, although I forget if it's ever by name. Jesus calls him, ". . . a murderer from the beginning, a liar and the Father of Lies."</text>
