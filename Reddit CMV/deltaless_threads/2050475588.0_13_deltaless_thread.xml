    <title>CMV: The only difference between AI (digital) life and human (physical) life is the material which sustains it</title>
    <original_poster>CarpeBedlam</original_poster>
    <original_post>To be clear, I’m talking about a theoretical AI which is designed specifically to be indistinguishable from a human, and accomplishes that goal. Also, I don’t necessarily mean an android that is physically equivalent (e.g. Ash from “Alien”), but just a digital consciousness living in a computer which is capable of replicating human behavior. At that point, I’m struggling to find a difference between the two that isn’t solely about the material required to sustain the life (blood, tissue, etc. for human life, silicon, copper, etc. for AI life).</original_post>

    <text>Can you define life/living?

Because if your definition of "life" includes the instinct to replicate, then AI doesn't necessarily have this. You need to program AI to tell it that replication is one of its objectives. But for human life (and all animal life) replication is an inherent objective.</text>

    <text>Yeah, this gets into the same area as other responses. That a human can exist without an objective, but an AI requires an objective, even if that objective is to have no objective.</text>
