    <original_post>I believe homeless spikes are wrong.

I think homeless spikes should be removed. I believe you will always have rough sleepers (although we could probably drastically reduce the amount in the UK) and as such should not introduce such measures.

I just donâ€™t get the justification.

EDIT: Anybody who wants can sleep in my garden, or outside my house. If I didn't live with someone else who'd be worried about getting his stuff pinched I'd let anybody who asked sleep in my house, although I wouldn't let them have my room n I'd keep the door locked. There is very little to steal that I own.

I've never owned a car, never will, I just cannot justify it morally because of the environmental damage they cause. If I did own one I would let people sleep in it.

I do see a massive difference between putting spikes in what is a pubic place (regardless of who 'owns' it) and not letting homeless people sleep in your house though. I think it's moot.

    <text>I more thought it would be an interesting debate. I think I've got a little to wound up by the whole thing as I've got a real passion about helping the homeless.

I think I've probably made a few embarrassingly rash replies, but dang I didn't like the accusations of hypocrisy in my opposition to the things.

I guess they're an imperfect temporary solution to some of the negative externalities of our homeless problem. I'll go through the thread and respond a bit more calmly if I can find the time.

I still feel the resources would be better spent getting people off the street and that morally it's just bloody wrong in my gut. Very conflicted.</text>
