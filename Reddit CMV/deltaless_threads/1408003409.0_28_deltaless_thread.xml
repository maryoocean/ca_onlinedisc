    <title>CMV: Average men do not have a good chance of having sex with women.</title>
    <original_poster>fitness35754745</original_poster>
    <original_post>My lady friends husband has had a threesome before and they are looking into being able to do it again.

This guy is 6 foot 3.

For me I'm only average sized. 5 foot 9 which an average penis of 5.5 inches length and 4.8 inches girth. My looks are also average only too I would say. However I would say my personality is good towards friends, I've managed to get my lady friend to open up to me about talking about her sexual experiences so I must be doing something right. (No flirting just friends talking, I'm lucky to have a friend like her)

I'm super insecure about this and this has kept me from sleeping. I'm not exsactly worried about having threesomes or often sex, I just feel quite inferior for not.

Do average guys really have a chance with this type of thing? I cant help but feel this guys height (and possible above average penis size) is making women consider sleeping with him more. Do I have atleast a good chance? I believe I dont and that I'm at a very big disadvantage. 

I know from fair studies that the preferred penis size is bigger than average and I'm sure the preferred height for a man is above average too. I'm more worried about penis size because well, it can change the plessure the women recieves no matter good or bad.</original_post>

    <text>Here's my take, having been around the block a few times:

* Yes, this fellow's height and looks probably make him more attractive
* They also make him much more confident
* Being more confident makes him more comfortable being forward, and more ok with rejection

I can say from personal experience that, at least in gay sex, a 5.5" penis works just fine. Bigger's neat, but more for novelty than necessity. If a bigger dick were necessary for good sex, the average dick would be bigger.

The big factor here is how well you take care of yourself, how confident you are, and how emotionally intelligent you are. I know some very plain gentlemen who've had MFF threesomes before, but not very shy gentlemen.</text>
