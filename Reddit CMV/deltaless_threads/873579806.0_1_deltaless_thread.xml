    <title>CMV: Skwovet is just British Bidoof</title>
    <original_poster>ShaddowFox</original_poster>
    <original_post>I mean, just look at this damn thing. It's all poofy and useless. It's like Bidoof just stood on two feet and poofed it's tail. It's everywhere, like tree herpes. And all it does is get in the way and steal my berries. You know who else always showed up to ruin my good time? **Bidoof**, that's right! I bet you can also guess what gangster is rolling the same typing with a similar stat spread? ^Bidoof. Skwovet is terrible. You know who has the same dentist as Bidoof? I mean, it's Greedent... but it still counts!</original_post>
