    <original_post>Prayer as an act of reaching to a deity for help or comfort has no appreciable effect beyond what can be achieved by normal positive thinking.

Praying to end world hunger or to get a job has no effect unless you or someone else makes the decision to achieve the goal. These goals could also just as easily be achieved without prayer.

Edit: I do not believe in the non corporeal nature of prayer. I do believe in the effects such as positive thinking giving someone a better understanding of who they are a what they can do.</original_post>

    <text>It depends if you are a religious person or not, of course a person who deeply believes in god do think that prayers can make a change, but a person who lacks faith in a god doesn't think that way. Perhaps someone should first change your view about if god exists.</text>

And if the topic is whether prayer affects objective reality, one group is objectively wrong. Each may be entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts.

&amp;gt;Perhaps someone should first change your view about if god exists.

Not necessarily. If prayer does work better than regular old positive thinking, it my indeed have a natural explanation.</text>
