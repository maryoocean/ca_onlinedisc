    <title>CMV: 'Jump scares' are a cheap party trick, and movies that are full of them shouldn't be considered horror</title>

Lately I've noticed that most horror movies rely on jump scares. Something will unexpectedly pop out at the audience, a loud noise will startle everyone, you know the works. Sometimes the movie tries to trick people into believing that a certain scene will have a jump scare, to make the viewer feel safe, and then do a jump scare in the next scene.

I think that movies like Paranormal Activity, The Conjuring and The Darkness do not do their best to scare the audience in a creative way.

Jump scares do something physical to your body. Sometimes my mom jumps out at the me when I walk through the door, to elicit a scream or a 'fear' reaction from me. However, a second later I'm just laughing because it's silly and not at all scary.

When I go see a movie at the theater that has a lot of jump scares, most of the audience members just seem to be laughing. You may hear a collective gasp or a scream, but that's just a reflex. 

Most movies riddled with jump scares do not leave an impression on me. I find them annoying.

Jump scares do not tell a story that sends shivers down your spine and causes you to lay awake at night. Jump scares do not show you a gruesome scene that will be burned into your mind for the weeks to come.

Jump scares are cheap party tricks. They are annoying and do not elicit any feelings of terror. 

Change my view.

    <text>There are basically 2 schools of horror, shock/gore/gross-out and "fun".

With the former, there is a certain level of arms-race going on to make people as uneasy and scared as possible while still being able to show in a theatre or rent commercially.

With the latter, it's about being collectively startled at key moments, like on a rollercoaster. Part of the theatre, and group watching experience is having an experience together, and that is less likely to occur when you don't have those key moments.

If you want to sit alone and get freaked the fuck out, there are many movies to do that, but horror is big genre.</text>

    <text>So what would be a good horror movie that does not fall within those two categories? </text>
