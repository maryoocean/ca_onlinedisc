    <title>CMV: Sustainability, from a philosophical perspective, is misguided</title>
    <original_poster>Pyropeace</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've been an advocate of sustainability for a while. However, I've recently begun to question the underlying assumptions behind the sustainability movement. 

Nothing is truly, infinitely sustainable. The sun will eventually go nova, killing everyone on earth (if humans haven't already gone extinct by then). If humanity manages to escape Earth, then the universe will likely perish as well, depending on what model you accept. The universe is in a constant state of change, and nothing lasts forever. Is it better to be moderately happy for a long period of time or extremely happy for a short period of time? When talking about entire societies, I tend towards the latter, though on an individual basis I tend towards the former. 

Essentially, my question is this; what is the value in things that last a long time in a universe where nothing is eternal?</original_post>

    <text>You're not being sustainable for the people that will exist 100k years from now. You're being sustainable to have the next few generations live comfortably. Yes, nothing is "truly" sustainable, especially in our culture and lifestyle. But there are things we can do to have the earth be healthy for as long as there are creatures that will live on it, including our descendants...

It sounds like the reasoning of someone who's depressed. This doesn't sound healthy to me.</text>
