    <title>cmv: American society is still transmisogynoir - and anyone who claims otherwise is still sympathetic to old colonial racist transphobic values.</title>
    <original_poster>Cahania</original_poster>
    <original_post>Today we live in a society which maintains that women get less of a say, white people run our institutions, and thought leaders like elon musk are deeming calling a cis person cis is a SLUR. normalising relations with these ROACHES is fundamentally racist, transphobic, anti feminist. A true transmisogynoir 4 course MEAL. if you asked the average person, they wouldnt be aware of these concepts - theyd be living along a normal life cause they DONT CARE. American society is transmisogynoir and the fact that people don't even know the terms like this is evidence enough that people don't care.</original_post>

    <text>Just asking but do you consider any racial animus and oppression of non-black as part of this transmisogynoir?

Worded a different way, do you think all racial oppression in the US stems from anti-blackness? If not, I question your use of transmisogynoir.</text>

    <text>why would i care about whether they are black? that is the old wave of transmisogynoir thought. Have you studied this recently? perhaps your understanding of the term is outdated</text>

    <text>Then letâ€™s clear it up. Can you point me to some academics who have redefined misogynoir to extend beyond black women? Bonus points if they are black women trying to expand the definition.</text>

    <text>Why should I have to prove my point to you? Itâ€™s change MY view not change YOUR view. Academic thought has changed and you are behind the times - itâ€™s okay! Not all of us are educated</text>

    <text>You have no data so I could say something like asian people are doing better in the United States than white people but with no evidence does that mean thatâ€™s a good viewpoint?</text>

    <text>Look, Iâ€™m tryin to clarify a language thing. If you readily have sources *that you trust* to provide me information so we can be on the same page, that makes it go much smoother. I can find sources that still define mysogynoir in relation to specifically black women, and obviously, as youâ€™re contending, thatâ€™s outdated.

I donâ€™t automatically believe your claim just because you made it, *especially* when itâ€™s with regard to a word created by a black woman to describe black womenâ€™s experiences.

Also, as an aside, this post is a Rule D violation. All trans-related topics are banned from the sub, so expect this post to be removed here in a bit.</text>
