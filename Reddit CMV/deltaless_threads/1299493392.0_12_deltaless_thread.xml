    <title>CMV: a better way to pay for college would be a wage percentage system</title>
    <original_poster>SaltySpursSupporter</original_poster>
    <original_post>instead of needing to take out thousands of dollars for student loans, maybe this is a better idea. instead of needing to pay money outright, negotiate a percentage of your future wage. depending on the program you're entering and the amount of years in that system, you can negotiate the percentage and the amount of years. if the person has a minimum wage job for the chosen amount of years, that's still all they get. i'm sure there are problems here that I haven't thought of. you're welcome to change my mind.</original_post>

    <text>This would cause a college to descriminates in favour of choosing applicants from high income backgrounds, as they are most likely to have higher incomes.</text>

They already de facto do this, but indirectly with things like "legacy admissions"</text>

    <text>This would increase the incentive for it. Right now it's only done to encourage donations. This would be true of all students</text>

    <text>Not actually the case. They pay based on their future earnings, so the only thing it would encourage is the college to offer better educations that more students stick with and earn higher salaries as a result.</text>

It probably would increase job prospects, not necessarily education. It would still encourage some descrimination against lower income persons because we know that all else equal, including education, rich people will on average make more than poor people</text>

    <text>That is because lower income people tend to have less upward mobility but once they achieve higher education their pasts are relatively negligible, statistically speaking.</text>
