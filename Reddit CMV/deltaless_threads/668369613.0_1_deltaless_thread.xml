    <title>CMV: The question of "do we live in a simulation" doesn't matter</title>
    <original_poster>mix_420</original_poster>
    <original_post>I say this for two reasons:

1. You can't prove it. Can't really think of anything you can't explain with common sense that proves that we live in a simulation.
2. There's no point in it. I don't see how life changes in any way if you were to know you were in a simulation. I understand that knowledge is a great thing and we should try to get knowledge even if it doesn't matter, but because of #1 it makes it pointless.

Basically what I'm saying here is there's no point in asking this question if you will never have the answer to it, considering the only reason to ask the question is for the knowledge of it, as you'll never achieve it.</original_post>

    <text>Your arguments extend to religion as well. Does the question of whether or not God exists matter? We can’t prove it, and if it’s true or not, it changes nothing.</text>

    <text>Unrelated question but I think it's worth pointing out that if the answer to it is "God exists" it gives more credibility to religions, which tend to offer more than just the idea of God.

Edit: Since it's unrelated though I don't want to have this argument on this thread haha</text>

    <text>Its absolutely not unrelated. I showed you why the argument is analogous. </text>
