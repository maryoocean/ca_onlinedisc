    <title>CMV: The Idea that Anyone Criticizing the Ghostbusters remake will be branded a misogynist is a fabrication, motivated by people's desire to feel persecuted by feminists.</title>

    <original_post>So, as you may be aware, the new remake of Ghostbusters, a movie surrounded by controversy, has been released to critics, and reviews are beginning to come in. The reviews are decidedly mixed, the top critics catalogued by RottenTomatoes.com are split 6 to 7 on whether it's fresh or rotten, with the rest of the critics generally being more positive. 

Reddit of course has an interesting history with this movie, which largely consists of a circlejerk every time it's brought up about feminism, SJWs and political correctness. This has not changed since the movie was released, with people in every review thread talking about how anyone that positively reviews the film must be a feminist, or be terrified of the feminist backlash for being critical of it. [This](http://imgur.com/a/fKRXP) is currently one of the top posts on the ghostbusters sub.

I've not seen any actual feminists claiming any and all criticism must be rooted in sexism. I've seen feminists saying that the immediate backlash to a female cast, dismissing it as political correctness, etc is sexism, but never the idea that any criticism is sexist. In fact, most of the feminists I've seen are fairly mixed, thinking the trailers weren't that funny, and that the black character's position in the crew plays on racial stereotypes.

So, I'm pretty sure that most of this is just reddit being reddit and jerking itself off about how edgy it is to go against the "feminist agenda," but I'd kind of like to believe I'm wrong, and that I ought to have more faith in people, so CMV. Have there been people being slandered just for not liking the film? Is there some vast feminist conspiracy to censor people who don't like the movie, and have any of the people writing the negative reviews faced this? Since I'm sure this topic has been discussed before, I'm also interested if anything has changed since the actual reviews were released.

    <text>I think that arguments between people about this movie have made both sides escalate to an absurd degree. When things escalate, they become far less reasonable, and it isn't hard to find extreme examples from people on either side of this movie.

I'm sure that there are some people who immediately weren't interested in or disliked the reboot because it has a female cast. I'm also sure that there are some people who were interested for that same reason. All before a trailer was even released.

Since then, both sides have become firmly entrenched and any debate of the movie has become hugely overblown.

Some feminists have felt the movie has pre-emptively received an inordinate amount of criticism. The official trailer has an astounding [924,000 dislikes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ugHP-yZXw&amp;amp;index=9&amp;amp;list=PLirAqAtl_h2o1ism1dr5SbvB8Mf7Ve6Aa). It's the [9th most disliked YouTube video of all time](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLirAqAtl_h2o1ism1dr5SbvB8Mf7Ve6Aa), and there's not a single other movie trailer that comes anywhere in the top 100. 

People who dislike the movie feel that they are trapped. If they dislike the reboot or trailer, some feminists may think it is exclusively due to sexism, which destroys any potential for discussion. 

You can cherry pick claims for either side of this, but neither of them are completely fabricated.</text>
