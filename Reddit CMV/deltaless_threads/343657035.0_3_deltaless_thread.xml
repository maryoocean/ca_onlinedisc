    <title>CMV: U.S. Expenditures on defense is why there is so few terrorist attacks</title>
    <original_poster>KS1867</original_poster>
    <original_post>On Reddit the U.S. gets a lot of flak for spending so much on its defense budget. People often use the argument "[some uncommon event] kills more people a year than terrorists." I argue that this is because of our massive intelligence and military capabilities. Another hot button issue on Reddit seems to be the use of drones and many will argue that our drone program makes more enemies than it kills. Although I do recognize the flaws with our drone program I believe stopping is not a solution and the drone program weakens the capabilities of terrorists networks to effectively plan attacks. I subscribe to the "peace means carrying a big stick" philosophy. Change my view on American defense spending and drones.  </original_post>

    <text>When you consider we spent more than $1,000,000,000,000 on the Iraq War, and it's well accepted that it led directly to the rise of ISIS, it seems the opposite of your point is true: the more we spend on "defense," the more terrorists we create. </text>

    <text>I 100% agree that the war in Iraq was a mistake and created so many problems for the US, but now that those problems are here we have to face them. </text>

    <text>In my view, we should address them through cooperation with their  grievances, like Palestine. Terrorism occurs when legitimate political expression is unavailable. </text>

    <text>I agree with that. A lot of the problems we have are hard to find a solution to because we don't allow for a legitimate voice to negotiate with. Our relationship with Israel is something that needs to be reviewed before we can sit at the negotiation table. </text>

    <text>What "greivences" could the Iraqi government possibly accept without undermining their legitimacy?</text>
