    <title>CMV: women are not going for the 'upper tier' of men</title>
    <original_poster>BadgerSame6600</original_poster>
    <original_post>I see this rhetoric over and over and over online, and hear it IRL sometimes.  It drives me crazy tbh. I am a man out in the world, living life, 35 years of it now. I have friends who are all over the spectrum of physical attractiveness. Some are single, most aren't. Their gfs/wifes are also across the spectrum. In most couples I know, friends and acquaintances,  the woman is better looking, earns more, or has more social skills ect. 

Now I know this is my experience, so it is anecdotal, but at the same time I just don't buy this whole women are too choosy. My opinion is that the dudes who say this are refusing to address their flaws and accept them. If these men believe this and they go out into the world feeling hard done by, fighting a losing battle, then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Most people can smell that level of victimhood a mile of. 

OK, open to have this challenge, so- change my view, Redditors! </original_post>

Yes, and. I think the issue societally is that, for the most part, men are expected to ask out women. This one step immediately heavily skews a certain numbers game - confident men who just ask out a lot of women are going to end up with better results than more socially awkward or introverted men who might have a better chance if women were socially encouraged to ask them out.

I also think that women often err on the side of MORE choosy than they need to be than LESS choosy than they need to be, which is probably for the best overall. But I also understand guys who are frustrated when they end up on the short end of that particular stick.</text>
