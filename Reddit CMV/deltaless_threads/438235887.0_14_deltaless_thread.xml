    <title>CMV: If gender is a social construct, then so is race</title>
    <original_poster>BoppeBoye</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let us take, as a given, that gender is divorced from the circumstances of your birth, that it is not a mental illness, and that there is no biological basis for what gender identity someone should express. Have I phrased that effectively? I'm trying to be concise, but I want to portray that premise correctly.

Why, then, should race be different than gender? If race carries with it "shared experience" and "lived experience", etc - that assumes that the only way you could understand what it's like to be a minority is to have lived your entire life as that particular minority. I'm not arguing against that, I agree that there are certain experiences that I could not comprehend - for instance, overbearing &amp;amp; strict Asian parents with exceedingly high expectations. 

But, if someone can change their gender or decide (?) that they identify as a different gender without having the prior lived experience of said gender, then why can't someone identify as a different race?

I'm not able to encompass all the variables which could lead someone to identify as another gender, but is it not possible for someone to come to the same conclusion with their race? What if an Indian man grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood, saw or experienced the same (or similar) discrimination as them, had minimal exposure to Indian culture; and this led him to conclude that he identifies more closely as a black man, rather than Indian? 

I would also like to cite Rachel Dolezal, who was uniformly mocked for being (afaik) the first trans-black woman in the public eye. It seems similar to transgender discrimination to me, assuming that there is something wrong with her mentally for deciding to become a black woman... Anyway, I'm not really defending her because that's not really in line with what I described in the previous paragraph (she grew up privileged IIRC), but the public reaction of mockery goes against the leftist belief of acceptance, by my perspective.

So, in short, why can there be no such thing as trans-racial people, the same way there are transgender?

    <text>It's a tricky knot to untangle, but here are my intuitions.

Gender and race are both social constructs. But race and gender serve different social purposes and so are experienced differently^*. "Race" is an extremely loose idea that mostly exists to reinforce social hierarchies. (What, after all, is a "Hispanic" person, biologically speaking?) In fact, plenty of people have racial identities that *are* unique from their ancestry. But these identities seem to be imposed on the person from the outside. Imagine, for example, a black American declaring herself white. This would not change her position in the social hierarchy that race enforces. 

Gender, meanwhile, strikes me as more internal. A person tends to understand her gender as a description of what kind of person she **is**, rather than about where her community fits on the social ladder. If I feel very "feminine," that strikes me as independent of the way the world perceives me, and even independent of how I present myself. 

*(in the US in 2017; who knows about what the world will be like in 1,000 years--maybe there will be "transracial" people!)</text>
