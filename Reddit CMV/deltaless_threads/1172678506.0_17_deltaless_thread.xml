    <title>CMV: Human Life has no innate worth due to the Laws of Supply and Demand</title>
    <original_poster>Flare-Crow</original_poster>
    <original_post>Please put the torches away and stick with me for just a moment; I'm not a monster, I swear!

&amp;amp;nbsp;

So first I'd like to define the difference between Human Life and a Human Being. My premise rests on defining the two separately. Let me assure you that I feel that a Human Being with a developed consciousness is irreplaceable. However, due to the recent surge in discussions on abortion, I've been hammering out the details on a premise I'd like to present here in an effort to determine any flaws in it: **Human Life has no innate value, as there are over 7 billion humans on this planet, and the Laws of Supply and Demand dictate that an unborn child therefore only holds subjective worth.**


I noticed that many people seem to innately assume that unborn children are a highly valuable commodity, which confuses me, as any of 2-4 billion women could essentially produce billions more embryos at any given time. While a specific embryo or fetus can absolutely hold subjective value to a person, which is why I support laws that punish the murder of a pregnant person as though it was a double homicide, I don't see the issue with a person choosing to rid themselves of an unwanted pregnancy; nothing of inherent or subjective value was lost. While I'm not a fan of abortions used as matter of convenience (I'd much prefer universal healthcare and a robust Sex Ed curriculum), I see an abortion as nothing more than a medical procedure with no morality involved any more than a kidney transplant is "moral."

    <text>Okay So I am not trying to be rude here but in order for this to be a manageable conversation it's needs to be said.  There are so many things incorrect in terms of the application of economic theory and philosophy here that the only way this is going to be manageable is to go at them one at a time.

1. Supply and demand have nothing to do with innate vs . subjective value.  Demand is a result of the aggregate opinions people have about the value of commodities. S &amp;amp; D modeling is a theoretical tool for analyzing economics, and while the theories are derived from looking at what people are willing to pay for things, they have nothing to do with establishing innate value, that is a philosophical question not an economic one.  The process of aggregation does not convert a market value into any other kind of value innate or otherwise (I can't tell if you trying to use this to bridge your point into general ethics, you kind of hinted at it) but market value and ethical value are not the same concept at all and can't be used interchangeably.
2. We could choose to look past point 1 and say we are strictly talking about market price value.   There are 2 problems here.
   1. Theoretical modeling is just that, theoretical, is is a tool we use not a definition of truth.  Truth in the real world requires real world data, and as others have pointed out there is in fact real world data that shows that that humans do have value in a strict market sense.  A model can be appropriate applied when it's shows that in a given situation is premises are true, in other words, it is supported by actual data.  If this is not the case then the theory is nothing more than an idea.  To put it another way you don't dismiss real world data by saying *but I thought up a different idea that seems intuitive in my head*.
   2. Even if we stay completely within the theoretical framework you understanding of economic theory is lacking.  Human beings are neither a liquid asset nor are they a commodity, so even within a theoretical framework the application of this type of modeling doesn't make sense.

I am willing to discuss all of these if you like but please pick one at a time if you interested either  1, 2.1, or 2.2 or else this is going to be a difficult to organize mess.</text>

    <text>No, you're correct. I addressed elsewhere that my original point should've been that Human Life seems to approach a value of zero due to Supply and Demand; innate value obviously shouldn't have been included in the discussion at all.</text>
