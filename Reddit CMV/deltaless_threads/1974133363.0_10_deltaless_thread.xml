    <title>CMV: Westerners should be deeply worried by our nations' inefficiency when building infrastructure</title>
    <original_poster>Real_Carl_Ramirez</original_poster>
    <original_post>I was recently watching this video: [The Â£100BN Railway Dividing a Nation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSD5ps9bLQ0) (it is about extreme delays and cost blowouts with the UK's HSR2 project). Similarly in the USA, the [California High-Speed Rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_High-Speed_Rail) also has extreme delays and cost blowouts.

It reminds me of what I've seen here in Australia:

* In Sydney, the [CBD and South East Light Rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBD_and_South_East_Light_Rail) was [delayed by over a year](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8102513/Sydneys-light-rail-faces-delay-troubled-project-set-held-back.html) and had [a 1.2 billion AUD cost blowout](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-07/light-rail-contractor-sues-nsw-government/9629948).
* In Adelaide, the mere electrification of the [Gawler railway line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawler_railway_line) [cost 900 million AUD and was delayed by almost 2 years](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-04-02/free-substitute-buses-for-adelaides-gawler-train-line/100961484).
* Nationwide, the [NBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network) had a cost blowout, costing [51 billion AUD](https://archive.ph/jL764) instead of the [original forecast of 29.5 billion AUD](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-13/federal-election-nbn-promises-past-and-present/7506714). Keep in mind that this is the cheaper, slower version of the NBN instead of the original version, and thus [Australia ranks #56 in internet speeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Internet_connection_speeds), behind even highly-censored nations like Russia, Saudi Arabia and the PRC.

Before you tell me "*that's because your country is corrupt*", that doesn't make it any less worrying. If western nations constantly face cost blowouts and delays with infrastructure projects, how can we possibly have hope that we can enjoy fast internet in the future? Or clear up transport problems? Or build the infrastructure needed for sustainable development? 

There's a reason why more countries support the PRC's [territorial claims](https://thediplomat.com/2016/07/who-supports-china-in-the-south-china-sea-and-why/) and [policies against Uyghurs](https://archive.ph/wip/8QMbX) than oppose them. Namely, it's because the PRC has been able to buy the loyalty of nations because it's well-known for quickly and cost-effectively building infrastructure for them. I don't want to shill for the PRC here, but Western countries' inefficiency when building infrastructure makes it harder for us to buy the loyalty of nations with this trick.

It's not like western nations are inherently incapable of efficiently building infrastructure (which is another reason why this recent trend of extreme delays and cost blowouts should be worrying):

* Australia's Snowy Mountains Scheme cost the equivalent of [6 billion AUD](https://web.archive.org/web/20060919222034/http://www.ministers.dotars.gov.au/ja/pressconf/2004/APC9_2004.htm)
* The USA's lunar landing effort cost the equivalent of [280 billion USD](https://www.planetary.org/space-policy/cost-of-apollo)
* The Channel Tunnel linking the UK to France cost the equivalent of [12 billion GBP](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/france/articles/channel-tunnel-facts/)</original_post>

    <text>&amp;gt;Are you sure that the PRC isn't just as bad, but we don't know it due to lack of transparency?

Obviously the PRC is very much into censorship and has corruption problems of its own. But put it this way - on a per capita basis, they're poorer than most Western nations - so if they were inefficient with construction, shouldn't they have gone broke already?</text>

I don't agree that not being broke necessarily means they're efficient with construction, but if that's what it takes to convince you, it seems that is happening anyway.
