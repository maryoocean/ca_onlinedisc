    <title>CMV: I believe that there should be no penalty for Excessive Celebration in the NFL</title>
    <original_poster>mrspuff202</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have no idea why there are excessive celebration rules in the NFL rule book. If a player has done something exceptional, they should be allowed to celebrate as they wish as long as: A) they don't aggress upon a player on the other team (which is taunting) and B) the celebration doesn't run on for a ridiculous amount of time. These celebrations are fun bits of creativity and flair that allow the players to express their personality and ingenuity and make the game much more fun to watch.

A counterargument that I already foresee: What kind of example does that set for kids?

My answer: Actually a pretty good one. For one, there is a major difference between celebrating and taunting that even a child can understand: one is mean, and any four year old could make that distinction. But celebrations are a big part of why I played football, basketball, baseball, etc. as a kid. The batflip after a homerun, thumping my chest like Paul Pierce after nailing an improbable three: it teaches them to strive to be the best that they can be and to be happy when they succeed. Celebration of one's good deeds is a very good trait to have.

That's my view. Change my view, Reddit! Or else, Goodell will be getting a sternly worded letter from me.

    <text>Several tears ago when this rule was first introduced there was a problem where spontaneous high-fives after a touchdown started turning into choreographed "[end-zone dances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bbzHdqUUFU)". It began getting really juvenile and started detracting from the game. 

It might be an overreach to ban all celebrations, but it was thought that it was better to ban all celebrations than to have to make the referees decide is each particular celebration was spontaneous or not. 

The celebrations really didn't add anything to the game, and the penalty is actually pretty rarely enforced and usually only in situations where there is actual taunting or poor sportsmanship. </text>

    <text>See, but I'm in favor of the endzone dances. I don't think it was detracting from the game at all. I think it was fun and creative and great spectacle, which is really what sports is about.

Like, Ochocinco when he was with the Bengals did the putt the ball with the pylon like Tiger Woods move, and that was awesome. It was always great wondering what he would do next. It wasn't deliberate at another player, but it was all in good fun.</text>

    <text>imo the end-zone dancing celebrations add EVERYTHING to the game

haha I don't really care about the game itself but I will watch me some damn football if it means the payoff is some unique dancing celebrations.</text>

    <text>&amp;gt;I don't really care about the game itself

That's probably the essence of it. People who do care for the game aren't there to see this kind of nonsense. If you want dancing, then watch the cheerleaders. </text>
