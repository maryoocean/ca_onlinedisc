    <title>CMV: While the GME squeeze is a powerful display of retail trader’s power, there is no endgame that doesn’t result in them losing massive amount of money.</title>

    <original_post>The GameStop squeeze carried out by r/wsb and others demonstrated the power of retail traders and seems like a fair punishment on market makers and hedge funds that have taken advantage of the stock market for ages, but there is no way that it will end well for them. Sure, a lot of stock brokers have lost millions on shorts because retail traders refuse to sell and are still buying, but they can afford to do so because they have enormous amounts of cash to rest on and because GME is clearly overvalued. GME’s market cap is several times its revenue, and the only reason it is that high is because of the artificial demand created by internet communities. At some point, sellers are going to fold and GME is going to collapse, and everybody that purchased it when it was overvalued is going to lose massive amounts of money, while Wall Street short sellers laugh their way to the bank.</original_post>

    <text>I think it is important to remember that it is a group, so different people have different end games. 

And while I agree with you that the whole event is a bit of a pyramid game (where the first people are making profit on the people who come next), I am sure there are individual investors who got in early and have decided to get out and take the profit. On the flip side, it is important to remember the potential losses for hedge fund managers who shorted the stock are potentially infinite, and I am sure there are some that cut their losses - ultimately giving their money to small time investors.

So as an individual investor you don't need an end game, just sell the stock and take your profit. That said, I imagine there are a lot of hedge fund managers who shorted GameStop who can just wait, and even some that have jumped in late, because there is no doubt it will come crashing back down soon.</text>

    <text>That’s just the thing though. I completely agree with you that some individual investors will win, but they will be the minority. What I imagine will happen is that several small investors who leave now or in the next few days will happily profit with no real cost to anybody. But once larger shareholders, who likely know what they are doing, start selling, the surge in supply will kills the price of GME and will collapse the price to its previous levels.</text>

    <text>That is what is strange about the thing- this is not a disagreement about the value of GameStop- but rather an attempt to express anger. The challenge is that during that expression people are ALSO thinking they are going to make money. 

There are a bunch of intangible gains here. From being a part of a movement, to “screwing the big guy”, that are making this action irrational- but really that is what is happening</text>

    <text>Even if you take that line of thinking, what big guy are you really scaring? From what I understand, Melvin might go down, but so what? GME’s market cap is 20b or so, and Melvin has 7b AUM. That’s a lot to the individual investors who pumped their life savings into GME, but pennies to Wall Street. Blackrock has 7.43 TRILLION in AUM, literally 1000x Melvin. Sure you but a blip on everyone radar and might get a couple guys fired, but overall you poured your savings(or a couple hundred, but still) out in vain.</text>
