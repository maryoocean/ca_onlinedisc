    <title>CMV: While the GME squeeze is a powerful display of retail trader’s power, there is no endgame that doesn’t result in them losing massive amount of money.</title>

    <original_post>The GameStop squeeze carried out by r/wsb and others demonstrated the power of retail traders and seems like a fair punishment on market makers and hedge funds that have taken advantage of the stock market for ages, but there is no way that it will end well for them. Sure, a lot of stock brokers have lost millions on shorts because retail traders refuse to sell and are still buying, but they can afford to do so because they have enormous amounts of cash to rest on and because GME is clearly overvalued. GME’s market cap is several times its revenue, and the only reason it is that high is because of the artificial demand created by internet communities. At some point, sellers are going to fold and GME is going to collapse, and everybody that purchased it when it was overvalued is going to lose massive amounts of money, while Wall Street short sellers laugh their way to the bank.</original_post>

    <text>I think you're missing part of the point. Speculation is based on the concept of the "greater fool". Assuming Gamestop doesn't become profitable enough to justify the higher price, then investment to drive its price up is speculation. I think we agree.

The difference is that the greater fool isn't necessarily the Redditor. GME was shorted over 100% of its shares. That means that those short sellers increased the supply of GME stocks, and when their options expire, they are required to buy the shares back from the market to "reset". So, people are buying up all the shares, counting on the fact that there is a guaranteed "greater fool" because the hedge funds are required to take that position. This is only this much of an issue because of the fact that hedge funds took a huge risk shorting this stock this much.

Anyone who buys in while there are still lots of outstanding shorts are making an educated choice based on observation of silly risk taken by hedge funds. People piling on after those short positions are closed are just speculating.</text>
