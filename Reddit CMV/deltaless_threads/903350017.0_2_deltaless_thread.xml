    <title>CMV: Israel is not the primary cause of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, nor can they do much to stop it.</title>
    <original_poster>thosewhowait</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've been seeing a lot of people and politicians argue that we need to put pressure on the Israeli government to end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. There absolutely is a humanitarian crisis going on there; the nearly two million Palestinians living there don't have clean water, building materials, or infrastructure. However, it seems to me that this is largely due to the fact that Hamas is the de-facto ruler of the strip. As I understand it, when Israel decided to pull out of Gaza, they established considerable infrastructure like greenhouses to give the Palestinians a head start, but as soon as they pulled out, Hamas organized parties to destroy the Israeli infrastructure that they left. Also, rather than using building material like concrete to actually build up high quality infrastructure, they use it to build tunnels under Israel so they can conduct terrorist attacks on civilians. Hamas has also been increasingly authoritarian and preventing rival parties to hold any public events, so the people's ability to put a more effective and people-oriented government into power is greatly diminished. Putting aside Hamas's corruption, they are also in a conflict with Isis (which has established strongholds in the Sinai, bordering Gaza) which is further distracting them from increasing the standard of living of their people.

I want to make it clear that I do not at all support Israel's expansion of settlements into Palestinian territory, and I genuinely do believe that some form of two state solution involving Israel and at least the West Bank will be possible, but with Gaza specifically, I'm not really sure what can realistically be done by Israel that would not put their citizens in danger. As I understand it, Israel limits import of construction materials because Hamas continues to use them to build tunnels under Israel, screens shipments to Gaza because of continuous rocket attacks on civilian areas by Hamas, and prevents free movement from Gaza to the West Bank because suicide bombings / stabbings are a serious issue there. It's a lot less infrequent for buses to blow up now, so it seems pretty effective. 

I really do feel that the Gazans are the true victims here, but I think Hamas is currently the main cause of their suffering, not Israel. Regardless, I'm not sure what a concrete, feasible action would be for Israel to help the Gazans that wouldn't open them up to further terrorism.

Also, I just want to clarify that this is about the *current situation*. I think it's another conversation about the events that led up to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a whole, but I'm more interested in discussing what Israel could realistically do *right now* that would not compromise their security.</original_post>

    <text>&amp;gt;Palestinians attack Jews literally the day after the UN votes to establish Israel, and haven't stopped since.
