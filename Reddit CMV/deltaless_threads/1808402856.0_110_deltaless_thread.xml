    <title>CMV: Fredom of speech is far more important than a few people being offended</title>
    <original_poster>brbrWh0r3</original_poster>
    <original_post>Freedom of speech should be protected and kept, there shouldn't be people arrested for anti trans comments or insulting a soldier/soldiers, or for nazi jokes, or racist remarks or jokes.

Those should all be handled between people, if someone says stuff you dont like you handle it, simply block them or avoid them, theres a whole world you can be in and that persons in a very tiny part of it. 

It makes me nervous seeing people arrested and charged for saying things. It's only leading us to a place where we can be arrested for saying whatever the government doesnt like. And they shouldn't be in that much power to effect our communication with eachother. 

I live in scotland and dont feel I have freedom of speech anymore. 

(For the record I'm a white woman who's bi and have trans thoughts ig for those folks who say it never has been about me, it has sometimes, and in more ways than just those)

Edit: No it's not just anti trans people, Yes I believe crimes other than hate crimes involving speech should be illegal (threatening violence, doxing, defamation) but I also believe insults, jokes and bad takes or thoughts should not be.

Edit 2: Consequences for what is said like losing a job, getting insulted, losing friends ect is totally fine I just dont think the Government should be in charge of what can get you arrested in this sence.

Edit 3: I live in SCOTLAND in the UNITED KINGDOM or in BRITAIN depending what you say, I'm not american, im also not here advocating for my right to be a dick, im just saying the government arent the ones I want saying what I cant say, I mean twitter can destroy lives without them anyway.</original_post>

    <text>All of this stuff doesn’t actually happen. The idea that people are being arrested just for making jokes is an exaggeration of the truth that often leaves out important context. From your other comments it seems like you are talking specifically about hate speech, and since you mentioned anti trans stuff I’ll start with that. 

There was a law passed in Canada addressing hate speech against trans people. Many news sites jumped at the chance to say that people were being “arrested just for misgendering someone.” In reality, the law added trans people to the list of those protected under hate crime laws, and said that consistent misgendering can be used *as evidence* for charges of harassment or abuse, or more serious crimes motivated by hate. 

When you hear stories like these they often focus on one tweet someone made, ignore the harmful things the person has ACTUALLY done that got them arrested, and blow things out of proportion from there. The people who write articles like that are TRYING to scare you, and they know how to do it well.</text>

    <text>Good comment.

The Canadian law instance is a golden example of people misunderstanding stuff as anti-free speech</text>
