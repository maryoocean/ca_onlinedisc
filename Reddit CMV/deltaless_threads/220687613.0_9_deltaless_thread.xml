    <title>CMV: Rap Music Sucks</title>
    <original_poster>chronicallyfailed</original_poster>
    <original_post>So it may just be that all the rap I've listened too has been bad, but I really can't think of a rap song or a song featuring rapping that isn't just unlistenably bad. 

The lyrics, even when they're not breathtakingly sexist and homophobic, tend to be boring, unimaginative crap along the lines of "my penis is big and I do drugs" - not that I have anything against songs about penises and drugs, just the way it seems to be done in rap that I've heard is just boastful and repetetive.

Musically, I just hear incessant, grating melodies played over a shitty drumbeat while someone talks over the top of it. A lot of the time I don't really see how it qualifies as music.

Also, the amount of ridiculous, pretentious crap in the music videos just makes it hard for me to take them seriously at all.

But I don't really want to just dismiss rap music like that, so please explain to me how it's not shit, and examples of it not being shit would be nice too.

    <text>one or two songs doesn't account for all of rap

i agree, but you shouldn't discount it and call it crap

because its an art form that you just haven't tapped

yes, some lyrics confound but don't call it a wrap

. 

because you see, underneath all the pretentious words

to a certain degree, it's a science that you most likely unheard

some songs are like dirt and debris, but others are insanely absurd

i wish you and i could agree, that there is art in the songs you misheard

.

unfortunately, this art does comprise of a lot of obscene language

but personally i overlook that to save me some anguish

and see it as a marvelously unique way to say my story and my wishes

you gotta see the intricacy lest you let your mind be small and in squishes

.

so my full counter argument is this

you should not group and target rap with certain songs that you dismiss

it's only a small compartment of the whole deep abyss

once you dive in, you'll find in it, a style, a form, a storm of vocabulary and wits
