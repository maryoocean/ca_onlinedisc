    <title>CMV: There are no good or bad music genres, just good or bad artists.</title>

    <original_post>I get it. Rock is your favorite music genre, you hate country or pop. Whatever it is, it doesn’t make your favorite genre “the one”.

Music is like food. There’s pizza, hamburguers, sandwiches, tacos, burritos, nuggets, etc. That doesn’t make one better than the other. But there are people or restaurants that can make great delicious pizzas and others who make average pizzas. The same way, there are amazing rappers with great lyricism and rhythm, and others who use an overproduced beat and have poor lyricism. There are Metal guitarists with great technique and years of experience, and others who don’t.

And this whole “my favorite genre is better than yours” thing applies to almost everything: books, videogames, movies...</original_post>

    <text>Genres can be bad. Country music is such an example: 

Country is objective bad because it's only talks about 9 things inherent to the genre: love, women, truck, country/flag/patriotism, dog, alcohol, gambling, cowboys, etc. As a genre it's limited and can't branch out about other things by definition (or it wouldn't be country). Because of this, country music has no range, is isn't inclusive, is stereotypical, and predictable. I can find you a rap song about literally anything, which makes it better because the expression of the art touches more things than the 9 things country can touch.</text>
