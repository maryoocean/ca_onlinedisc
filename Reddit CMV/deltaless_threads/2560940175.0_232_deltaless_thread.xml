    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>If people really had issue with this, they're just looking for an excuse to be combative for one reason or another.  

Americans are from the country the United States of America.  "American" refers to the country.  North and South America are continents.  Do those folks from Germany consider themselves German or European?  Either is technically correct, but I presume most would use the former.</text>
