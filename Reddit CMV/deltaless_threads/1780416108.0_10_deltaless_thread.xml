    <title>CMV: The West does not understand Russia and its efforts to make it capitulate won't come into fruition</title>
    <original_poster>Tasogare80s</original_poster>
    <original_post>Russia and Russian politics in general is vastly different from the long-standing democratic societies of Western countries. The perception of western countries that Russia will ultimately capitulate due to economic pressures is presumptuous, primarily because it assumes that Russia operates on the same status quo that western countries do.

If and when a democratic country enters a war, public pressure and change in leadership ensures a war's end so long as the public deems it unworthy of continuation. Russia is a non-democratic society, to which the constraints of public opinion do not bind the Russian state to the opinions of its people due to it not caring about what the people think and its irrelevance to the decision-making process.

In some parts of Europe, parliaments have existed since the medieval ages, which eventually became our models for modern parliamentarianism and republican democracy. Russia never experienced these developments and hence from Tsardom to Soviet to the modern era, the public opinion of your average Russian is irrelevant. The only parliament that Russia ever had was the Zemsky Sobor, which only approved the line of succession for Tsars whose sole and only purpose and power was taken away by Tsar Peter I. This is important because Russian society did not experience the same thing that western democracies did, and hence assuming that they function in a similar way is flawed.

One important thing to note is that because of this, every time the Russian state and country underwent hardship they willingly outsourced their hardships on their people. Knowing full well that the people are incapable of rebellion and the nobility being so weak, as a result of their deprivation of rights and strengths to even affect anything. When Soviet Russia was undergoing economic hardship during the 20s Stalin blamed the kulaks. When Peter the Great went to war against Sweden, he incentivized nobles with tax breaks if they taxed their peasants effectively. I am willing to bet that Putin does not care about the average Russian pensioner and if shit hits the fan he will outsource the consequences of his war, to his people.

Additionally, when Stalin purged the kulaks, he also purged the Soviet military and politicians, replacing his power base anew. When Ivan the Terrible's power was being questioned by the nobility and boyars, he engaged in a political purge that executed most of the Russian aristocracy. Putin's support when he rose to power were former KGB agents and when he consolidated his power, he was backed by the oligarchs. There are now rumours that Putin has surrounded himself with right-wing ideologues like Alexandre Dugin and the military elite. The Russian nobility is interchangeable and they aren't cemented within the political system. Hence if the oligarchs feel that their profits are going dry due to sanctions, all Putin has to do is arrest them, shoot them or sack them to fall in line. 

If history tells us anything Russia is going to crackdown hard on its own people and engage in another political purge.</original_post>

    <text>I've heard another theory recently: That once or twice every generation, Russia fucks up by going to war, Russian society reacts and the country has to pay for it, and a period of stagnation or upheaval comes along.

The Crimean War - Nicholas I screwed up the hegemony that Russia had gained after the Napoleonic Wars and being the gendarme of Europe in 1848.

The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 - A military victory was achieved as an attempt to unilaterally reset Russia's position after the Crimean War. However, it furthered Russia's diplomatic isolation, cutting it off from what would become the Central Powers, and alienating England, and failed in its goals in the Balkans. 

The Russo-Japanese War - Disaster, the 1905 Revolution, Constitutional Monarchy that would last until Nicholas II took it back in 1907.

The First World War - Going on the biggest of all foreign adventures, ending up in disaster. Directly leading to the two Revolutions, and a Civil War, Famine, extreme popular reaction to this disaster.

The Winter War - Military humiliation convinces Hitler of the USSR's weakness.

Great Patriotic War - Obviously, but here Russia wins, at huge cost.

Soviet Afghan War - The Bear Trap. It at least *partially* contributes to Perestroika and Glasnost, and the Autumn of Nations.

And now, the adventure in 2014 and the 2022 war. In short - society *does* react to these military blunders.

As an aside, Russia has had parliaments/councils before, just briefly - In 1905-1907, between the February and October Revolutions, and finally during the Gorbachev years. These were genuine flashes of open debate in an open society.</text>

&amp;gt; react to these military blunders.

The biggest military blunder, of course, is being practiced by Russia right now: never get involved in a land war in Asia!
