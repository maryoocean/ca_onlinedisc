    <title>I have no faith in humanity and believe it is doomed to destroy itself or bring destruction to the universe. CMV.</title>

    <original_post>We have 2000+ years of recorded history to learn from as a species. Every variant of evil is recorded to be learned from: totalitarianism, terrorism, communism, imperialism, witch hunts, library burnings, genocides etc. Records of wars for every different reason (ideological, monetary, expansion.) 

We have seen what happens when the environment is not taken care of (Easter Island) or a species is overhunted (Almost all megafauna, the dodo, bison etc.)

And yet humanity does not change. We continue to build weapons, enforce military service in countries across the globe, use child labor/soldiers, encourage violence, find reasons to separate "us" from "them." Even space is on the verge of being militarized, the one last hope for humanity to not bring it's carnage out into the universe. 

Every religion is intolerant of every other religion. Even Buddhists and Atheists are not exempt from this. All they bring is hatred and intolerance.

And despite overwhelming evidence for anthropogenic climate change, shrinking resources, a limited amount of fresh water etc. There is no change. Nothing is really being fixed. Every day I hear more news that makes me think "what hope is there for humanity?"

Please change my view.</original_post>

    <text>Could you clarify what is so horrible to humanity about communism? The way you grouped it makes me think you don't really understand it.</text>

    <text>That's not what I asked. How does an economic system have a bad effect on humanity and our future. Those killings were done by the regimes that run the country. A capitalist regime could do the exact same, and has. Communism is an economic system opposite to capitalism, not a government type or system. Many past "bad" regimes were communist because the leaders could just control the economy with an iron fist. No mater what, communism doesn't hurt anyone when not done by a totalitarian/authoritarian government.</text>
