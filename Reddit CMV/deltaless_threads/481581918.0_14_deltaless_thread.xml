    <title>CMV: If I'm not guilty, I want to be tried by a judge rather than a jury</title>
    <original_poster>Mimshot</original_poster>
    <original_post>In the American criminal justice system you have the *right* to a jury trial, but you are not obligated to exercise your right a jury. It's possible to have what's known as a "bench trial" where in addition to determining the admissibility of evidence, and sentencing if convicted, the judge determines guilt or innocence as well.

Jury trials are notoriously unpredictable, therefore if I'm actually not guilty of a crime, I want a professional judging my case. Historically, bench trials result in acquittals [more often than from juries](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/judge_v_judge). I understand wanting to be judged by someone who never saw inadmissible evidence, if I'm guilty but the evidence was illegally obtained, but if I'm actually not guilty, why should I take a chance with a jury?

Change my view.

    <text>Both the state and the defense have a right to a jury trial, so both parties have to agree to waive a jury.  

That aside, you want a jury with a technical case that might be hard to follow since you only have to raise a reasonable doubt in one juror to avoid a conviction whereas a judge may be familiar with the technical aspects of typical cases and won’t be easily confused.  Example:  DWI.  There are a lot of regulations on how field sobriety tests have to be given and I’ve seen lawyers make hay out of taking officers through those details on cross examination, but a criminal judge will be familiar enough with them not to be thrown off by that kind of tactic.  There are also common arguments used to try and confuse a jury on the BAC results such as rising and falling BAC levels (has to do with the BAC lagging behind the drinking so that you could be under .08 when driving but an hour later at the station with a rising BAC be over).  A judge has already heard these kinds of arguments and won’t be unduly swayed. </text>

I've never heard that. Do you have a source?</text>

There are more cases, and each state may have its own case line as well as their own rules of criminal procedure that spell it out. </text>

    <text>Under federal law, the prosecution has to agree to waive a jury. If the case is under state law, it depends, obviously, but some states give the defendant the absolute right to waive a jury.

When it comes to DWI (or DUI), often the case is not serious enough to cross the threshold for guaranteeing a right to a jury trial.</text>

    <text>In my particular state, any misdemeanor offense can be appealed out of misdemeanor court and Heard de novo in front of a jury.  This includes jury trials on speeding tickets (which are hilarious).  So, at least where I’m from, the severity of the offense doesn’t come into play. </text>
