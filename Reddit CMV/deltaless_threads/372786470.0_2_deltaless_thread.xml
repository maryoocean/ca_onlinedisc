    <title>CMV: Kids today are losing the ability to express themselves effectively</title>

    <original_post>Since writing is an important tool of communication it is important to learn the process without the help of paraphrasing from the writings of others and arriving at ideas naturally. most kids don't write using their own ideas, they search the internet and arrange the writings of other people into an essay. The effect of this method of writing papers is harmful because if they don't arrive at ideas naturally and write them in their own words they will not be able to write or know proper grammar without the help of technology. </original_post>

    <text>It's actually more difficult to be unoriginal these days with turnitin.com and other plagiarism checking services.

While research essays are mostly searching the Internet for facts and others' perspectives, that's the point of them. You're *supposed* to read various ideas and then organize them to present both sides fairly or argue for the position you agree with. 

Creative writing is where students express themselves and experiment, and these cannot be easily copied.</text>

    <text>So that's sort of my point, the lack of creative writing in schools is having the effect of less articulate youths. if you arrange others people ideas and writing styles you aren't really using your own abilities to communicate an idea to others.</text>

Sure you are. Engaging meaningfully with other people's ideas is actually one of the harder skills to teach, and it's impressive when students are capable of it. Any sixth grader can ramble on and on about what *they* want to talk about; it's a much more advanced skill to be able to synthesize ideas from prompts, class discussions, supplementary materials, and so on into a cohesive text. </text>
