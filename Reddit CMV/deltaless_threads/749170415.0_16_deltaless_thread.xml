    <original_post>The institutions they run the US are horrendous.  

We have the worlds largest prison population, which maintains legal slavery.

Capitalist overlords hoard the majority of wealth while the working poor is real and growing.

For not the first time in kinda recent history concentration camps are back. 

My entire life I’ve been told things are the way they are, and there’s nothing to be done about it.  But that’s fucking bullshit. 

I don’t believe for a second that reforms will ever give power, real power to the people of this world. The teachers, the workers, the families that will grind through this hellscape as best they can for their entire lives, just trying not to go hungry on the streets.  

The State has a monopoly on violence. If we break that monopoly up, if we use that power for ourselves, against the enemies of humanity, maybe the world gets better sooner rather than later.</original_post>

    <text>The last US civil war led to the the deaths of over a million people by some counts. This from a total population of 31 million. Keeping that proportion with today’s population leads to over 10 million deaths. Is that a price worth paying?

Is it worth paying if there are clear alternatives that avoid such bloodshed?

That isn’t even going into all the reasons why a new civil war could be far worse e.g. more powerful weapons, a broader theatre of war, more evenly matched sides etc. 

I look at American like a house that has taken a lot of people a lot of time to build. Some rooms are dirty and can be cleaned out (e.g. prison reform) without impacting the structure of the house. It’s a house with regular meetings to decide what should be done to repair/clean it....revolution would be tearing down the house, with many housemates still inside and having to start over. Potentially creating a dozen new problems in the effort to solve one.</text>

    <text>It’s a house built on genocide and slavery. 
The house needs to be burned to the ground</text>

    <text>There are few countries in the world that don’t have slavery/genocide somewhere in their history. Maybe it’s just because I studied history that am more aware of it...but name any country and I think I can point to worse things than what occurred in the States. 

There is so much more to American history than just those two things. Hundreds of millions of people who lived, loved and tried to make their community/world a better place. Many actually died preventing more genocide and slavery around the world.</text>
