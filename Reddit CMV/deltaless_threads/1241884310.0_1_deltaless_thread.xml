    <title>CMV: if you live in a “traditionally Christian” nation you should use Merry Christmas as the default greeting/goodbye unless you’re asked not to.</title>
    <original_poster>physioworld</original_poster>
    <original_post>Basically I think of it similar to misgendering people. In that context use the pronouns of the gender they appear to present as (unless you already know the person’s wishes). If and when someone asks you to use an alternate set, you apologise and change going forward. 

The same should be done with Christmas- in my experience almost nobody has any genuine objection to being told merry Christmas, hell, I was discussing just today with a woman in a full hijab our favourite (largely secular) aspects of Christmas, all the while referring to things as “Christmas XYZ”. However if someone tells me they’d prefer happy holidays then I’ll just switch. Just like pronouns it literally makes no difference to me. 

You can change my view by showing me that knowingly using words that will make someone else feel less welcome or upset is not worth it compared to the potential loss I might feel at using a different term. Of course maybe you can come up with other arguments I’ve not thought of.

Edit: this only applies “at this time of year” say more or less the month of December.</original_post>

    <text>Firs for all I’m an atheist. I’m not suggesting people be forced or anything, I’m just saying that it’s conventional to use a certain term, it’s then polite to not use that term when asked. Not sure how this came off as bigoted.</text>

    <text>Where did I say I think one religion is more important? I’m an atheist who says merry Christmas and celebrates Christmas, I even sometimes go to church on Christmas because I like the carols I grew up with. My point is that “merry Christmas” is, as a phrase, about as Christian as Thursday is Norse paganism...but, if someone I say it to feels strongly that they’d rather I use a different sound from my mouth, I think I should respect that.</text>

I think you did a really terrible job explaining your point in your post. And as you explain it more your point is one barely worth changing. You mentioned nothing about the phrase being less associated with Christianity. You quite literally said "You SHOULD use Merry Christmas" suggesting you think it should be the default for everyone in those countries, suggesting the religion it's associated with has priority. Then here in the comments you're quite literally saying the opposite.</text>

    <text>Delta!

That’s a very fair point. I should have said “if you want to wish someone a merry Christmas you should feel absolutely no concern about doing so, even if the other person is clearly of another faith because most people take the phrase as it’s intended- a kind word intended to wish you well and not as a religious barb”</text>
