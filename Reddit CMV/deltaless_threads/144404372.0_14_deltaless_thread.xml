    <title>CMV: The release of the CCTV footage of Michael Brown is not character assassination, but a vital component of the incident that helps all parties understand the context of the shooting and the state of mind of the individuals involved.</title>

    <original_post>First off, let me clarify, I am not defending the actions of Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. I believe that he did use excessive force and the shooting should be thoroughly investigated. This CMV post is not to debate over whether or not Officer Wilson needs to be tried or whether the Ferguson Police is an example of police militarisation in the US. This post is solely to look at the decision to release the CCTV footage of Michael Brown robbing a convenience store.

Now that that's out of the way, I don't really understand why everyone was so angry at the release of the CCTV footage showing what appears to be Michael Brown robbing a convenience store. I see in multiple news sources where people have stated that the footage "'appeared to cast aspersions' on the dead man" or is a form of character assassination.*

Finding out that the shooting victim had just returned from robbing a store is critical information, because it provides context for the fact that a police officer confronted him (over something minor and unrelated like obstructing the street) and a violent altercation took place soon after. I see family members and other people saying that he wasn't "perfect," but it seems to me that they're dismissing the fact that he had just committed a crime.* The police officer may not have known of Michael Brown's actions, but it makes sense that Michael Brown would be more on-edge, scared, and impulsive after committing a crime and encountering a police officer so soon after. Thus, this footage provides a critical perspective into Michael Brown's state of mind and his subsequent mannerisms/behavior might have alerted Officer Wilson and escalated the encounter.

My view is that the CCTV footage was essential information that needed to be provided to the public. While it may have been misconstrued as character assassination, the footage is an invaluable part of the story that helps explain the context and actions of both Officer Wilson and Michael Brown. 

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your comments! I really appreciate it. My view hasn't really changed and while I still believe the footage to be relevant and needed to be shown to the public, the institution releasing the footage should have been more removed from the situation i.e. not FPD, but the FBI/DoJ/even the Prosecutor's Office. Additionally, the footage should have been released alongside other information which was excluded, providing a lop-sided view of the situation which served to inflame tensions rather than using information to allay them.

Edit: Thanks for the gold, stranger!

    <text>There's nothing necessarily wrong in releasing information that is absolutely relevant to the shooting. However, it can be problematic if you take an otherwise proper action for an inappropriate purpose. For example, you can fire an at-will employee for any reason or no reason, but you cannot fire an at-will employee because of their skin color, religion, or nationality. 

The release of the video smacked of an inappropriate purpose - that is, to paint this kid as a criminal to undermine public sympathy towards him (to defuse the riots), to paint him as someone more likely to attack a police officer given a criminal history or agitated mindset, etc etc. 

There are reasons why a person's past criminal history is regularly excluded from courtroom trials for different crimes, and it's because that information is HIGHLY PREJUDICIAL. Juries are much more likely to convict a person of a crime if they already perceive them as a criminal. Evidence of the robbery in this case would be admitted to any criminal/civil trial related to the shooting because it's certainly relevant. However, we're talking about press conferences here and not a courtroom - the cops' selective release of this information is highly prejudicial to Brown's support among in the public eye. This looked more like a tactic in a PR campaign than in a proper police investigation.</text>
