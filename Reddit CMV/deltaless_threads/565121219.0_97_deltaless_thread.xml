    <title>CMV: it is a jerk move to play music while camping within earshot of other campers.</title>

    <original_post>We put a tent up in a state park campground for about 4 weeks out of the summer. Most of the time you can just hear nature, people talking, kids playing, lots of birds and squirrels  . Every 5th day or so, there is someone who brings some Bluetooth speakers so they can listen to music , but loud  enough  that people in a half dozen sites nearby get to ‘enjoy’ whatever they are playing. 

Right now I’m cooking dinner and the guys next to me are playing U2, Dave Matthew Band and similar inoffensive crap.

This would be entirely normal in a backyard gathering, but once you reserve to be in a public campground, it becomes selfish, intrusive,  rude.

Am I wrong?

(I know it’s a known risk of car camping. I’m not really  mad. More rolling my eyes. I wish they’d shut that crap off.  )

    <text>I don’t think you I have any right to prevent people from doing this. You do not own the space and waves around you while camping just because you paid for a place to put your tent. If it’s 3 in the morning that’s a different story because they are interfering with people’s sleep, but if they’re cooking dinner and listening to music there’s nothing wrong with that. What if I decided that your voice is really annoying and I didn’t want to hear it while I am camping? Do you I think it would be okay for me to ask you to stop talking because I’m annoyed by the noise your voice makes? If you were yelling in the middle of the night that would be one thing, but if it’s day time and I would just rather hear the birds and trees than your shitty voice I would be be an asshole. 

It basically comes down to other people want to hear music in this situation, you don’t. Why would you just assume your opinion is the correct one? When you live in a free society that means dealing with other people’s freedom even if you don’t really like it. </text>
