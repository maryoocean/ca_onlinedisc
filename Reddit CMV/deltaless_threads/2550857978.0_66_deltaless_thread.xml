    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>I think one issue society has with cops is that they have a kind of “bro code” mentality about some issues. So yeah while Officer Smith didn’t use excessive force or shoot an unarmed suspect, he took his partner’s side to make the action sound justified. 

I’ve read articles about the cops who *do* report their coworkers end up resigning because the rest of the precinct no longer trusts them. This happens often enough that Blue Bloods did an episode with a similar plot line. 

I get it, in a cop’s line of work they often put their life in their partner’s hand so trust is essential.</text>
