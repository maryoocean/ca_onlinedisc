    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

What I find most fascinating about this discussion is when I have traveled, and I have been fortunate because if I ever have kids, I can tell them I have “seen” all the continents with my own eyes. Never been to Antarctica but I have seen it. 😥 barely. 
I setup that humble brag to say that **most of the people I have met that were from the U.S., rarely say “I’m American” or “I’m from the States”. Most of the ones I met traveling begin with a baseline of presumption. They usually say what state they are from. The bigger(size and/or population) the state, the greater the percentage that they will say the state. And you best believe more times than not -New Yorkers will just name the borough. It’s like mandatory. All ethnicities too. Like when you listen to the first 30 seconds of the great hip hop tracks from the ‘90s &amp; ‘00s.
