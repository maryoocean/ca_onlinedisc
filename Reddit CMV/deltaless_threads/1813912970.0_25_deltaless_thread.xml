    <original_post>Homosexuality is not natural, and neither is heterosexuality

There is no such thing as attraction in other mammal species, just the male raping the female and reproducing. 

Attraction in humans is a social construct. It's a way to soothe people or to bond similar to how bonobos do it.

Because us humans have “the instinctive need to produce offspring,” the sheer fact that men want to have PiV sex with women just for fun or without wanting kids, proves it's not a natural attraction.

Plus, most women don't care about being penetrated. It doesn't feel good for us, clitoral stimulation is a need for most. PiV sex has no purpose outside of getting pregnant. Sexual relationships are not necessary at all.</original_post>

You are not following the definition of "rape" our society has agreed to follow. You are extending it to an unreasonable degree.

&amp;gt;Attraction in humans is a social construct.

We can spot attraction in animals.

&amp;gt;Because us humans have “the instinctive need to produce offspring,” the sheer fact that men want to have PiV sex with women just for fun or without wanting kids, proves it's not a natural attraction.

Many biological functions have more than one "function". Many animals engage in non-reproductive sex. Sex specifically releases a tons of reward chemicals to make it worth while.

&amp;gt;Plus, most women don't care about being penetrated. It doesn't feel good for us, clitoral stimulation is a need for most. PiV sex has no purpose outside of getting pregnant. Sexual relationships are not necessary at all.

There are many women that would disagree with you. From the way you answer it is possible you are to an extent asexual, or you have a lower sex drive than most. Because if you don't experience "the need" for sex, or you don't enjoy it. Then I would agree that your question would seem reasonable.</text>
