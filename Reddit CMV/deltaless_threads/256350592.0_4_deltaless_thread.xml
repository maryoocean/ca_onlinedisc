    <title>CMV: Spotlight was a marginal movie that didn't deserve all of the accolades that it received [Obvious spoilers]</title>
    <original_poster>layze23</original_poster>
    <original_post>   Am I the only one in the world that thought this movie was just ok? I mean, I really don't see the appeal. I guess the acting was good, but seriously, I didn't find it entertaining at all. My wife loved it. It's not like it was poorly written, had bad cinematography, or anything like that, I just found it... boring. I guess to me it was just a boring subject. "Yeah, priests molest little boys on a large scale. Is that it?" You could have written that on a post-it note and handed it to me and I think I would have had about the same reaction, but saved me 2 hours of my life. I don't know why I'm so bothered by this movie. I guess it's because I heard so many good things about it, I was expecting a lot more. I just felt like it was a newspaper article about an unentertaining subject that was made into a movie and won a ton of awards and accolades. 

   In contrast, I thought The Martian was excellent and I typically find space in general pretty uninteresting (I know, space should be really interesting, but that's a discussion for another day). I thought the Martian was a million times better than Spotlight. Like I said, I just don't understand the appeal of Spotlight. It wasn't even like there was a mystery to solve. I guess the only thing I can see as even slightly interesting is that nobody understood the magnitude of the problem and it was only through persistent journalism that it was even discovered. But, meh, so what?

   I'm not trying to undermine anyone's opinion that enjoyed the movie or even the movie itself. There are a lot of movies that I know are good that I just don't enjoy much and that's fine. I'm just baffled that I seem to be one of the rare few that feels this way about the movie and it bothers me more than it probably should that I can't understand what about it appeals to people.

   Counterpoint from a friend: "I sort of equate movies like spotlight to documentaries. Some of my favorite documentaries are ones that contain subjects I have no interest in or don't think I'd find enjoyable (ex: journalism, catholic church scandal) and it succeeds in making it fascinating. I liked how the story and scandal unfolded. I don't particularly have an interest in the journalistic process and definitely didn't think I'd want to watch anything involving the church scandal but I found it intriguing."

   My response: "I know what you're saying. The subject itself doesn't have be interesting in a vacuum to be the focal point of a good movie. I agree with that. But I guess even the plot development wasn't interesting to me. I mean, everything happened exactly as I anticipated it would. Maybe it would have been more interesting if there was an unanticipated event or if something happened behind the journalistic scenes that nobody knew about or would have expected. But we already know the story and it unfolded exactly how I would have expected it to play out. 

   For example, of course the church was trying to keep the skeletons in the closet. That's what I would expect that organization to do in that situation, and furthermore, we already knew that's what they did."

   Please, guys and gals, CMV.

    <text>It is really hard to change your view on something this subjective, so I'll just raise one of the things I thought was really interesting about it.  It was very realistic about how journalism works - it showed competent professionals grinding out their job over the course of months, and it made that grind (to me) interesting.  None of the journalists were threatened or beaten up for trying to expose the truth, none of them were secretly working on the inside to sabotage the story, all of them pretty much agreed it was wrong and needed to be exposed.  There was no manufactured drama of the type you would normally get with a conspiracy/coverup movie - all the drama was intended to come from watching professionals do their work, be good at their job, and attempt to do so in a way that was careful about the need to tread lightly around the Catholic Church and be empathetic towards the victims of the Church's crimes.  

The thing it reminded me the most of was The Wire, particularly the first season.  There is something bold and unconventional about trying to capture what *really* makes these jobs interesting - most stories about cops and journalists aren't confident enough in their storytelling to do that.</text>
