    <title>CMV: Tipping makes no sense</title>
    <original_poster>adashofasshole</original_poster>
    <original_post>The general logic I hear behind tipping is because the driver or waiter does not make enough money. 

Well how is it the consumers fault that they are not making enough money? I can see the fault being placed on the employer for not paying enough, or even the company, but to place the responsibility on the consumer is completely lost to me. It would make more sense to me to even blame the employee for not working harder to find a better paying job (not the main point). 

The equivalent would be expecting kids to bring in money to give to underpaid teachers, which makes a lot more sense to me as students in public schools are not paying teachers for their service. 

Please, change my view. 

Edit: I still give my fair share of tips, also I understand it is not mandatory but it is highly frowned upon when someone doesnâ€™t tip. </original_post>

    <text>Tipping only makes sense in historical context. Much like encores at a concert, tips were not originally expected. They'd only be given out for extraordinary service, so as to encourage such service. But again much like encores, they began to simply be expected and now failing to do an encore or tip is seen as rude. It's a natural historical progression that's happened far more than you'd think. Things that represent the extraordinary become overused and then become much more mundane. The word "awesome" for example. Used to mean that something inspired awe, a very strong emotion. Now you can say it when your delivery order comes with an extra chicken wing. The extraordinary becomes the mundane. </text>

They make sense in a practical context as well. If a server would only make min. wage, then it's ALWAYS advantageous for them to work for tips. After all, it's better to make min. wage plus a chance of making more money than simply making min. wage.</text>

    <text>Well more the concept of giving tips. Obviously anyone would prefer to receive tips but why do people give them and why are they expected can only really be understood by looking at the history of tipping. </text>
