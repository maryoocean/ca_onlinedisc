    <title>CMV: I don't believe in punishment.</title>
    <original_poster>meur123</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't believe in punishment. I believe it's petty. I believe it does no good and only harm. As the old saying goes: "An eye for an eye makes the world blind." What does punishment actually achieve? If you kill somebody who killed somebody, it doesn't in any way bring them back. 

Look, I believe that we should have prisons, but not for punishment. The only reason to take away somebodies freedom is to prevent further harm to society. What has already been done is done. Prisons should focus instead on rehabilitation. If somebody is likely to cause harm to another, then it is necessary we take the means to prevent that. If they do not pose a danger, then it achieves nothing to take away their freedom.

**EDIT:** [I awarded a delta to someone that challenged the arguments of this final paragraph.](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/49fioa/cmv_i_dont_believe_in_punishment/d0regc3)

&amp;gt;Before you mention deterrence, I agree that we should aim to cut the problem out before it happens. Where I don't agree is that fear is an effective motivator. A much better solution would be to eliminate the conditions that coerce people into turning to crime.

Talking about deterrence was really tangential to the argument that I was actually making, and I was wrong to say that it is not in any way an effective tool.

But CMV, does punishment achieve anything for the greater good?

    <text>I'm guessing you don't have kids. You have to do some kind of punishment on your kids or they will run amok and make your life miserable (I find not letting them watch their favorite show is often good enough for small kids). Kids have to learn that acting up has consequences and they need to have empathy for others. As they grow older they begin to comprehend why you should respect others and how life is generally better for EVERYONE when you respect others, but at three and four that's a tough concept. If you never punish someone as a child then they don't really get that lesson and I personally believe they never learn empathy. You can find some of these kids at your local juvenile detention center. Or you can read about that affluenza kid, that's what happens without punishment. </text>

    <text>I dont think this kind of argument is an answer to OP's actual point, that punishment is only justified in so far as it keeps society safe, deters from further crimes (see his response to the top comment), and rehabilitates criminals, all in line with your point. What he doesnt believe in is that people truly deserve their punishment as a good in itself, meaning that if your actions would happen in a vacuum there would be no reason to punish anyone. Consequently questions about which kind and amount of punishment are justified become entirely scientific and independent from moral intuitions (other than consequentialism)</text>
