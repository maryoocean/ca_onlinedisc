    <title>CMV: The notion that the Democrats or Republicans "must" run Biden or Trump "because there are no other viable candidates" is ridiculous. There are thousands of people who would make better presidential candidates for 2024 than Biden or Trump.</title>

    <original_post>Every argument for Biden or Trump to run in 2024 boils down to some version of "status quo" or "inertia." We're told that the Ds and Rs have no choice but to run these super-old candidates because there's nobody else who could be suitable.

&amp;#x200B;

In a nation of 332,000,000 people, there are well over 100 million who are over the age of 35, American-born, and have resided in the United States for 14 years or more - in other words, are constitutionally eligible to run for president.

Out of those 100 million, surely at least half have a basic education, are mature, sensible, decent people, and have demonstrated solid character - and also be significantly younger than Trump or Biden.

Out of those 50 million, surely at least ten million would qualify as *highly* educated - the metrics of which can be tricky to figure out (is it a master's degree? or something else?) - but they would be significantly above average.

Out of those 10 million, surely at least one million would be quite exceptional - people who have substantially high IQ, have advanced quite far in life and a career - such as being a doctor, or having worked in public governmental service for decades, etc.

And out of those million, surely at least 10,000 would have the political know-how, the charisma, the political interest, maybe have spent significant time abroad in foreign countries or speak multiple languages, to be a suitable president.

In fact, even in Congress, state legislatures or governorships alone, there must be dozens of good, qualified, educated, experienced politicians who would be much younger than Trump or Biden, and who would make suitable presidential candidates. 

So, CMV on this one. I don't buy for one moment the notion that, in a nation of 332 million people, America somehow has no choice but to run Biden vs. Trump in 2024 because "we've got no one else who'd be a good candidate."  </original_post>

    <text>Anyone can choose to mount an effort if they desire. Many Republicans are doing so and Republican voters are indicating they overwhelmingly still want Trump.

On the Democratic side, it appears potential competitors prefer to sit this one out rather than challenge an incumbent president.

What exactly would you like to see happen? On one side, voters are making their preference quite clear. On the other, potential candidates don't want to run. As a result, we get a 2020 rematch.</text>

    <text>Just to nitpick: voters haven’t said anything yet as there hasn’t been an election, polling shows people want Trump.</text>

    <text>Voters have said to pollsters their likely future voting pattern. No one saying voters have voted, only that they’ve “indicated they overwhelmingly still want Trump.”</text>

    <text>Honestly, what I'd love to see would be for the D's and R's to **both** run totally fresh-name/fresh-face candidates in 2024.</text>

    <text>Republicans have said pretty vocally they don't want that. They want Trump. Democratic candidates don't want to run against a sitting president. It's not a matter of who is best qualified. It's simply a reflection of what voters and potential candidates want to do. If no one wants to run this is what happens.</text>
