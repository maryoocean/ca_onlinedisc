    <title>CMV: The NFL has every right to punish kneeling</title>
    <original_poster>Swaguuuu</original_poster>
    <original_post>The NFL is a private business. They should not be forced to yield their national platform and allow their employees to make political statements during work time that have nothing to do with football. This is not a free speech issue because it is not the government legislating the restrictions. They do not have to allow their employees, who agreed to follow their rules when they signed contracts, to use the NFL's access to millions of Americans to further their political agendas. And if you are going to say they must do this, then you better be okay with players displaying KKK hoods, swastika sleeves, #FreeHealthCareForAll signs, or whatever else they're feeling frisky about that day during the anthem too. 

If the players believe this is unreasonable, then stage a lockout or something because the NFL has every right to make rules and enforce them in their own workplace.

    <text>Should schools be allowed to punish for not standing for the pledge?</text>

    <text>To answer shortly, not if it's a government funded school. In completely private schools I imagine there will be more variables to the situation.</text>

    <text>Pledges and national anthems are political by their nature, players kneeling aren't starting the political conversation, they're responding to it. Why should they be forced to endorse something they don't believe in? Players should either be allowed to kneel or the anthem should be gotten rid of, not allowing kneeling is censorship of individual voices</text>
