    <title>The ends justify the means. CMV.</title>
    <original_poster>294116002</original_poster>
    <original_post>This was inspired by the "kill two people to save one" thread that was started a few days ago.

 This ideology is very often associated with terrible dictators and death and genocide, but I think that far more people actually hold it than let on. I very honestly believe that, if a result is favourable, the method used to reach it is very often irrelevant. A small note must be made here about probability: an action I take has a 1% chance of success, and succeeds, is *less* justified than if I had taken an action 
which had a 60% chance of success but failed. So I suppose my view could be refined as "in cases where the only variable of a set of actions or methods is the effect of said actions, unsavoury actions are justified ", so this is more of a philosophical CMV than a practical one. 

A few examples would be pertinent. **I AM WELL AWARE THAT SUCH SCENARIOS ARE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE AND AM MERELY USING THEM AS THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS, THANK YOU.**


* I believe that the Trolley Problem, that is, killing one person to save more than one person given that you know nothing of any of the participants, is justified in all it's forms. If I have to make a choice to kill 49% of the Earth's population to save 51%, the answer is the same.  There are only two actions to take, each have a 100% success rate, and the only variable is the result. Whether I am a passive observer or an active participant makes no real difference. 

* Rights and freedoms should be abolished if they demonstrably shown to have some net negative effect on society. If we created a controlled experiment to test the effect of freedom of the press on, say, the general happiness of the population, average IQ, life expectancy, and median household income, and find that a free press reduces every one of these things in the long run, than that particular freedom is unjustified and should be removed. 

* If it can be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that China's one-child policy will have a net-positive effect on society (say we create a parallel universe where the only difference is parallel-China does not create this policy), than the policy is justified, so long as the only thing we can change is whether or not to enact the policy. All future legislative policies *must* remain the same between the two Chinas.   </original_post>

    <text>Nothing gives you the right to end my life to save the lives of two people I don't know or don't care about. Morality is subjective and different for different individuals and with your hypothetical scenarios, you impose your sense of morality upon me. What decides that your moral system is correct?</text>

    <text>Nothing gives you the right to kill two other people to save yourself, which is in effect what you are saying. Whatever moral system you like to use, a life is a life is a life if no other information is given. This is simply a matter of arithmetic. </text>

    <text>&amp;gt;Nothing gives you the right to kill two other people to save yourself
Only according to your moral system, which is subjective in nature.

I'd kill hundreds of people if it would save me.</text>

    <text>So would I, but I make no presumption that my action is justifiable. </text>

    <text>Justifiable according to who? As I keep saying, every moral system is completely dependent on the person in question.

According to utilitarianism, sure, you're right. But how do we know that utilitarianism is the objectively correct system?</text>
