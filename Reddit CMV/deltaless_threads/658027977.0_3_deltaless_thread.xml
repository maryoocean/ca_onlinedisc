    <title>CMV: A person can express that they think another person is wrong without the discussion being "an argument"</title>
    <original_poster>IMArguin</original_poster>
    <original_post>My view is that two people can talk about differing opinions with the goal of coming to a closer alignment of their opinions without that discussion being an argument.

I further believe that saying that someone is not explaining themselves clearly, or is phrasing things in a way that isn't precise isnt a personal attack. People should be able to hear minor criticism of their ideas and their expression without feeling like the other person thinks they are dumb. Even the smartest people sometimes say things the wrong way or fail to look at something from every angle.

If a person is willing to change their opinion, then wanting to have a conversation where the other person might change their opinion as well or instead is not invalidating the other person's opinion or not letting them have their opinion.

Wanting to have a conversation stop at "here is my opinion", "here is my differing opinion" is not actually a conversation, and in some ways is more invalidating than wanting to talk about why each person holds their divergent opinion.

Outright saying "you are wrong" is rude, but implying that you think the other person is wrong by asking questions or giving counter examples is not rude.

Everyone has some soft spots and topics that are not open to conversation of any kind, but most topics should be open to some discussion. Especially if it is something that is not a core value, just something a person is interested in or learning.

Please explain to me how any/all of these views are wrong. Thank you.</original_post>

    <text>Argument means:

&amp;gt; an exchange of diverging or opposite views, typically a heated or angry one.

That means anytime you express that another person is wrong to them, it's an argument by definition. You are using the connotation that an argument is angry, and distinguishing it from a "discussion" that is calm and productive. But a calm, rational discussion is still technically an argument.</text>

    <text>You, /u/yyzjertl, and /u/poorfolkbows are basically saying tge same thing, so I'll just reply once. 


I recognize that you are correct, but part of the reason I put "argument" in quotes is because I mean it in the angry sense. I think that's how most people use the word.

For example, say the following conversation was over heard:


A:  Let's order a pizza.


B: I'd rather have KFC.


A: I'm not much of a KFC fan.


B:  I have a coupon, so it could be my treat.


A:  Okay, sounds good.


I think few people would say, "I overheard two people arguing about dinner", and I think B would be justifyably hurt if A said "why are you arguing with me?"</text>

    <text>The conversation you quoted is not an argument because there are no differing points of view here. One person says "I'd rather have KFC." The other says "I'm not much of a KFC fan." These statements are in no way contradictory: they can be (and are) both true simultaneously. Additionally, nobody in this conversation expressed that the other person is wrong, which is another indication that it is not an argument. For example, the following conversation would be an argument:

&amp;gt;A: Let's order a pizza.

&amp;gt;B: I'd rather have KFC.

&amp;gt;A: I'm not much of a KFC fan.

&amp;gt;B: You're wrong.

&amp;gt;A: What?

&amp;gt;B: You actually _are_ a KFC fan. You love KFC.

&amp;gt;A: No, I don't!

&amp;gt;B: Yes, you do.

This, I think you can agree, would be an argument.</text>

    <text>Implied in, "I'm not much of a KFC fan" is the statement "I don't think we should have KFC". I could have made this more clear by having A say, "No, I don't like KFC" or "I would rather not, I don't like KFC." I think if either of those statements were subbed in, most observers would still not say "I am watching an argument."


I agree that your example is an argument. As I said in my OP, saying "you're wrong" is rude, and B is suggesting A is lying, which is also inflammatory. As can be seen by your use of an exclamation point, the conversation is getting heated at the end. They are now no longer discussing "what is the best place to eat dinner" and having a difference of opinion, they are now discussing "does A like KFC" and having an argument.

Regardless, if you feel you deserve a delta for pointing out that most discussions are technically arguments (we even use the word "argument" to mean "statement" sometimes), I'll give you one. They're free, after all.</text>

    <text>So your CMV boils down to "It's possible to disagree without being angry"?

Because I don't think you're going to get a lot of pushback on that one.</text>

    <text>Not quite. My view is that two people disagreeing in a polite and respectful manner, while technically "making arguments" shouldn't be considered "arguing" or categorized the same way as an angry argument.

Plus all of the other details I wrote in my CMV. If the title is too broad to be srgued, then maybe something in the body of the post is faulty.</text>

    <text>This reminds me of my first post on this sub. 

You're refering to "arguing" as dominance-assertion, in which the loser is humiliated and the winner is proud. You're completely right that you can argue without giving into our more primitive instincts. 

Am I correct? </text>

    <text>You're using 'argument' to mean 'fight', while ignoring what 'argument' means.

No one is saying two people calmly disagreeing is a fight. But it is still an argument.</text>
