    <title>CMV: The Allies started WW2</title>
    <original_poster>SC2_BUSINESSMAN</original_poster>
    <original_post>First of all, the Treaty of Versailles was *way* too harsh, and everyone knew it. The hyperinflation that followed as a result of this Treaty was a huge factor that caused the German economy to collapse. In addition, events such as [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Ruhr) where France occupied Germany and killed civilians is basically what enabled Hitler to rise to power and garner enough support.

The [Polish Corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Corridor) was also a joke. Lots of ethnic germans were separated from East Germany, and there was no other option than for Germany to start invading or suffer from severe consequences such as economic collapse, overpopulation, and continuing to be bullied by the Allies. 

The only way out of this situation was to create infrastructure geared towards war, which would enable a lot of jobs to be created and for Germany to annex areas such as the Sedetenland and Rhineland which were important strategic areas, as well as reuniting scattered Germans. </original_post>

    <text>Primates caused ww2, as without primates there'd be no humans and no war.

The result of ww1 was the main reason for ww2, that doesnt change the fact it was the nazis that started the war. Saying war was the only choice for post ww1 pre ww2 Germany is not true</text>

    <text>That example doesn't really work. Germany had its back against the wall and had no other choice. Either decades long of recession + famine + overpopulation, or go to war. </text>

    <text>And how does a 6 year period of war that requires constant supplies to the frontline, causes bombings of major cities, gets the country ravaged by foreign armies and ends with the state split into two help the economic situation? </text>
