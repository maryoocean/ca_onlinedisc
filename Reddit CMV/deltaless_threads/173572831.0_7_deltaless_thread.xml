    <title>CMV: Twitter is nearly unreadable and people mostly only use it for posting</title>
    <original_poster>aurochs</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have tried many times to get into Twitter but I am always astounded by how visually unfriendly the experience is. 

Problems:

* There are so many out-of context sentences with people replying to each other but I can't see what they're replying to unless I click around for a while. Couldn't the replies be grouped with the original tweet without having to click on the name and then click 'details?'

* Some people are writing paragraphs spread out over multiple tweets so this leaves their rant broken up by unrelated tweets from other people. 

* I try to follow some comedians, but their tweets are usually something like "I'm in Chicago tonight, come my show. Now I'm in Minneapolis..."

* No categorization. Subjects are all over the place and common topics are not grouped together.

* Too many weird @symbols and #hashtags and http://links just creates a fatiguing reading experience.

I understand the reasons for all of these issues but they are all problems that have been solved by other platforms like reddit and Facebook. I can't understand why twitter is so popular despite all of these points. It could easily be so much better.

    <text>Twitter is only as good as you make it, which means you need to follow the right people. To me, Twitter is best used as a big comment section of my friends and some celebrities that I choose to follow. Twitter is good for things in the moment. People can comment on things like sports, or award shows, or news as it is happening and that is when it is best: as it is happening. 

* Did you think a ref made a bad call? tweet it. 
* Did you think of something clever to say about the award show? tweet it. 
* Did you just find out about a new awesome band in the local bar? tweet it. 
* Is your favorite author doing a surprise book signing at the mall? tweet it.
* Do you have a fun joke or moment to share? tweet it.
* Find an interesting and relevant news article? tweet a link.
* Do you want to share your trip to Europe? that's for your Facebook or your blog

tl;dr - like anything, you've got to use it correctly. twitter is for keeping up with the moment, so to use it properly you've got to follow users who use it that way.</text>
