    <title>Street Smart and Book Smart are two different types of intelligence. CMV.</title>
    <original_poster>frog_dog_outlaw</original_poster>
    <original_post>For the term "smart" I am referring to the combination of *knowledge - knowing something with familiarity gained through experience* and *intelligence - the ability to apply why you have learned*. (my own interpretations of the definitions) To me book smart refers to academic achievements and success or how well you did in school etc. Street smart is almost instinctive; its more than just common sense, it is being able to adapt and change with your environment. I am not saying you can't have both, but they are two different measures of intellect. Change my view.</original_post>

    <text>I think that it is wrong to look at them as two different things, but more as two different aspects of intelligence. 

For example; A kid who went to a good school and studied hard, got good grades, and became successful in their field applied what they learned effectively.

Also; A kid who grew up in a bad neighborhood, hustled and stole to survive, and lived past the age of 22.

I feel like these two people are both "smart" but, they are good at different stuff. Like someone who is good at painting, but not drawing. </text>
