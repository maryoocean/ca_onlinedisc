    <title>CMV:I believe torture to be perfectly ok if guilt is established beyond reasonable doubt.</title>
    <original_poster>Disgustingoldslob</original_poster>
    <original_post>Simple as the title, I believe that if someone is guilty of a serious crime against another (rape, murder, child abuse, etcetc) the victim or the family of the victim should be legally allowed to torture the guilty party as part of the punishment. I do not believe doing so lowers you to the level of the guilty, as you would be acting out violence on someone who harmed an innocent, while they were completely unjustified in their actions. I also do not believe the moral objections of others should interfere with the legal right of the family/victim.

Edit for clarification, I don't believe it should be mandatory, but I believe it should be an available option. I'm speaking of cases in which guilt is almost perfectly assured. (e.g sound witness testimony, DNA, caught in the act, admission of guilt, etc.)

    <text>Hurting people never made anyone apart from sadists feel good. Even if revenge feels justified and righteous in the moment, you will likely eventually come to regret inflicting that much pain on another human, and it certainly won't make you feel better. 

I think to get to the heart of this, we need to talk about what you hope to gain from this. The stated goal of the criminal justice system in developed nations is to deter crime and rehabilitate criminals. Whether or not it does this effectively is up for debate, but torture doesn't do that. Why should I show any loyalty or respect to a justice system that is just going to inflict pain to try and keep me in line? Whether or not I'm ever sentenced to torture, why should I respect them as a moral authority at all? Why should I follow any law of this society? If police and judges can hand out torturing as sentences, why on earth shouldn't I shoot them on sight?

I understand that people like to dehumanize criminals, but no man, no matter how heinous his crime, was born a monster. Monsters are made by society, and our goal can't be to punish our creations, but to do our best to make them better, and to find out why they are created and how to stop them from happening as well as we can. Or, as a very last resort, stop them from hurting innocents through incarceration.</text>

Have you asked everyone? I'm able to admit that many (if not a majority) of people would likely not benefit from or be able to harm another person in such a way, but it's also very likely some would. I don't think it's wrong to take some pleasure in showing a monster what it feels like to be helpless.

I'm aware of supposed function of the justice system, but I don't believe people who have ruined lives deserve rehabilitation. As I stated in previous comments, why should Joe get to receive treatment and reconnect with society if Joe killed someone who will never get to experience life, and their families will be forever scarred?  I don't believe that's justice, and I don't believe Joe should have that right. We cater to the needs of people like Joe with taxpayer money every day when the Joes of the world have done nothing but cause harm.

If someone needs the fear of punishment (torture, jail-time, a slap on the wrist, etc) to avoid causing lasting harm to another individual, then that person likely shouldn't be a member of civilized society to begin with. There's also no obligation to respect anyone as a moral authority as long as their stance is rational and sound. If the laws have a logical reason for being in place, we tow the line regardless of personal opinion on the matter.

What society did to him is not my concern. Everyone is responsible for their own actions, and unless I wronged him in some way I'm not accountable. I can't punch someone because I have a bad day and get sympathy. Shit happens, and we are responsible for dealing with it the best way possible. No one is forcing the hand of serious offenders.

You aren't the justice system. The justice system is an instrument of society, not your personal revenge instrument. Therefore, what society did to him is *very much* the concern of the justice system.

I know from experience. It doesn't help, and it takes a certain type of sadism to actually enjoy that long term, because you know in your heart, in your subconscious, that you are absolutely no better than they were.

&amp;gt;As I stated in previous comments, why should Joe get to receive treatment and reconnect with society if Joe killed someone who will never get to experience life, and their families will be forever scarred?

Why should Joe be punished for not having the same access to a stable home, good mental care, or proper development that could've prevented him from ever killing someone in the first place? Why not rage against the society that created him. Right now, all the evidence is in the court of the brain being deterministic in that giving certain input will result in the same output. Not universally, but for each brain. 

EDIT: I used the wrong word for a thing, and added clarification in the first response.</text>

You aren't everyone, and I know in my heart I would never take joy in harming someone for no reason. I'm typically very much non confrontational and enjoy the company of people. I don't feel as though causing harm to someone who goes out of their way to ruin the lives of another is on the same level.

Joe should not be punished for being less fortunate. I grew up less fortunate. Millions grow up less fortunate, abused, in horrible neighborhoods with little opportunities, etc. That isn't the issue. How you handle it is the issue. So many people could use the excuse of "if life was fair I wouldn't have done it". Life is not fair, but that doesn't give you carte blanche to ruin the life of another human being. Being bitter is fine, being resentful is fine, but the second you allow your own hardships to cause harm to someone else it's a problem. Now if I never met Joe and Joe decides to break into my house and hurt my family, should I give Joe sympathy for his plight? I don't think so. Had he turned to someone before that, I would have.</text>

    <text>Less fortunate is relative. You grew up less fortunate, I grew up less fortunate, but there are others who didn't. You should have some feeling of what I mean here: for people like us who grew up less fortunate, were abused, etc; there was someone who showed us compassion, or who showed us that we could rise above. They are our more-fortunate; some people don't get that either.

You don't think it is on the same level. Neither did I. I've talked to other people who have been there, and the consensus is overwhelming. For reasons, I'm not going to go into too many of their details for obvious reasons, but I know people for whom revenge seemed like a good solution for the things that certain people had done... and while remorse wasn't a constant, it was very very common, and even in the cases where remorse wasn't there, there was unanimously no sense of feeling any less angry. It was either no change or even more. 

It seemed like a good idea for me when my girlfriend was violated by her friend. I beat him down to a bloody pulp for it, and all it did was make me more angry and fracture a knuckle. The thing is, in the *vast* majority of these cases (minus sociopaths), they know they did something wrong, and they aren't evil monsters. He didn't raise a hand in his own defense at all. And he could have, I wasn't being very smart about my attack style, and I was wide open for counters. Something was wrong with him, but it wasn't full blown sociopathy either. He was seriously disturbed, but knew something was wrong.

Most murders that aren't gang-related are crimes of passion. Murder recidivism is really low, and most murderers don't go on to do it a second time. I can understand the want for vengeance, but it isn't something that makes it better, in any case I've encountered. It isn't everyone, but even a couple dozen is a decent sample size for something like this, I feel.</text>
