    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>ACAB is justified bc all cops enforce unjust laws that are inherently flawed, and much like Rosa parks on the bus, if law is unjust you are obligated to break it. Cops today have more in common with military in mindset and ammo. By participating in upping the violence anti you are a traitor against the people of your nation in exchange for a paycheck and you are a bastard.
Every nazi was a criminal and if you think that's black and white thinking I fear for your virtues.</text>
