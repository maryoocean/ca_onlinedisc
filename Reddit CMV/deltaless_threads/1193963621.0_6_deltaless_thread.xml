    <title>CMV: Self hate is not something bad.</title>
    <original_poster>NasZ1</original_poster>
    <original_post>All the popular self help information points, that we must not hate ourself, and try to love ourself. However hating yourself is a part of you. And trying to stop hating yourself will only backfire. Self hate is just as important as self love, and you can't have one without the other. The problem with self hate is not the self hate itself, but the huge amount of energy we spend, trying not to hate ourselves. You don't need to stop hating yourself, but to accept that it is a part of you, and like all emotions it is there for a reason, and it has valuable knowledge.</original_post>

    <text>If you hate yourself, you don't hate YOU. 

You hate the projections of other people on you, which you could not fulfill. Either you do things, they don't like or you don't do things, they would like you to do.

If you dismiss all the people which could bother you one way or the other, there would be no more reasons left for self-directed hate. You would just do, what you think is the best for you.</text>
