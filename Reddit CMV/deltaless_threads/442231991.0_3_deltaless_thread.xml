    <title>CMV: Christianity is held together through fear</title>
    <original_poster>M1STER_B0NES</original_poster>
    <original_post>My opinion is that if the fear of going to Hell was not present in the Christian ideology, then most of the followers of the religion would not be there.

Before I decided I was agnostic, that was my only reason for continuing to identify with the religion. Then, I decided I wasn't going to let fear control me. 

All in all, I don't see how this is any different than blackmailing a person to do what you want. You present your instruction, then tell them how you will completely devastate their life if they do not follow through.</original_post>

    <text>Sadly, this is the case. I'm interested to know how many folks, Rob Bell being a de facto leader of the cause, can justify this based on the teachings of Jesus as well as a quick glance at Revelation. Though I recognize this is probably not the place to have that discussion.</text>
