    <original_post>I believe everyone is racist just some people are more racist than others.

No matter how tolerant we try to be we are all ignorant to certain group(s) and because of that ignorance we make assumptions about certain groups of people.


As human beings we still have the primitive instinct to attack or run away from anything that looks different than us and in this case people who look different from us.

We all make assumptions.  For example, if you live in a predominately white neighborhood and you happen to see a group of black people hanging out you will notice something is a bit off.  These black people might be law biding citizens who isn't doing anything wrong but you don't know that.  You can say the same for any race but the point is if you see something "different" it will stick out to you and everyone else.  The same example can be the other way around and there can be a group of whites in a black neighborhood and that will stick out and you'll still make assumptions.

    <text>Racism is institutionalized discrimination against others.

I believe you mean that everyone to some degree is prejudiced, not racist.

I fully admit to being prejudiced in some ways, but I'd never intentionally or willingly participate in institutionalized oppression of any race. Furthermore, I would never actively or purposefully discriminate against a person of another race. That doesn't mean that I don't think  things about people that are based upon their race.
