    <title>CMV: The Republican party could guarantee a victory in the next election if they would reach out to labor unions.</title>
    <original_poster>humbleprotector</original_poster>
    <original_post>While Ronald Reagan was a very anti-union president, the Democratic party championed for labor. But in recent history Bill Clinton drafted NAFTA. With the Democratic support of Outsourcing USA Jobs and now open borders they lost a tremendous amount of loyal supporters. The AFL-CIO is a massive lobby group with one of the largest voter support of any but they saw their support fractured in the last election because of policies pushed by the Democratic Party, and the effects of the democratic economy. Forcing an American worker to compete with illegal wages, and with third world wages is not Labour friendly and loyal Democratic voters are leaving because they haven't seen a return for all their loyal support. Change my view.....</original_post>

    <text>At the moment Republicans have some labor unions interest at heart but, not because they are trying to reach out to labor unions. On top of that, its more of a Trump thing than a Republican party thing. Sure he leads it but, once hes gone its unclear if anyone takes up the mantle.

Republicans are still actively trying to take on public sector unions because of the damage they do to any given state.</text>
