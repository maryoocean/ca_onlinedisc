    <title>CMV: The only difference between AI (digital) life and human (physical) life is the material which sustains it</title>
    <original_poster>CarpeBedlam</original_poster>
    <original_post>To be clear, I’m talking about a theoretical AI which is designed specifically to be indistinguishable from a human, and accomplishes that goal. Also, I don’t necessarily mean an android that is physically equivalent (e.g. Ash from “Alien”), but just a digital consciousness living in a computer which is capable of replicating human behavior. At that point, I’m struggling to find a difference between the two that isn’t solely about the material required to sustain the life (blood, tissue, etc. for human life, silicon, copper, etc. for AI life).</original_post>

    <text>I just don't think we're at their yet. I don't disagree but I still think we're light ears away from making it so AI can replicate the millions of years of an uncaring universe building a computer made of meat that's not total uncanny valley. 

I mean some of us can be fooled, but not everyone.</text>

    <text>Yeah, I’d have to agree with that. My premise is unreasonable, even if my my “view” of its ramifications is sound.</text>
