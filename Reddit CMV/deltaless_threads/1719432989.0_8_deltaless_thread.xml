    <title>CMV: Adding rape as a legal punishment would be good for society.</title>
    <original_poster>kimagical</original_poster>
    <original_post>This started off as a showerthought but I couldn't find any reason this isn't legit, so here we go.

We need to add rape to the legal system as a viable additional punishment for heinous crimes.

I know what you're thinking. But it's not an unsually cruel punishment.

We already have the death sentence, and if not that, then life sentences of solitary confinement, which virtually all experts-- including official statements from the United Nations-- agree is torture.

And if you're a prisoner today, sometimes you are *already* getting raped. Other times you go "gay for the stay".

So don't tell me adding rape as a legal punishment is anything unusually cruel or sinking lower morally.

If anything, this would help guards regulate "safer" condom-provided prison rape, like how weed became regulated and safer after it was legalized in Canada.

So it's not much of a negative. But why is it a positive?

Here's why: there's a rapidly rising population of involuntary celibates. In the last 10 years alone, the population of these "incels" doubled from 12% of the young male population to 24%.

This is 45,000 incels ballooning to over 100,000. These incels have been behind an alarming number of mass murder sprees.

Every day incels on the dark web discuss organizing terrorism.

There's no fancy peer-reviewed study on that last bit yet-- but I've seen this happening with my own eyes by digging around social media years ago.

I found massive and highly active online communities who worship Elliot Roger and egg each other on to muster up the courage to flatten people with trucks. Buy automatic weapons and kill.

If the population is given free license on their own time to rape any inmates who have been handed the punishment of rape, this could solve some of the incel problem.

It *may* not help; obviously there's no proof in this area. It would be a moral wild west, but there's no time to wait. Innocent people are being shot to death.

It would be far more immoral to not at least try this preventative measure when there are innocents being murdered.

This availability of prison sex slaves with no bodily rights would also directly compete with street prostitution, lowering the demand for a dangerous and morally questionable industry, at best saving two birds with one nest.

At worst, we realize it's not helping and we revert the program. My view is that there is enough reason to try it.</original_post>

    <text>Prostitution already exists and it doesn't "fix" the incel problem because incels don't believe that prostitution counts. I'm fairly certain they wouldn't be satisfied with raping prisoners either. They reject prostitution because they view it as pitiful, and not changing the "fact" that they are doomed to never experience true intimacy due to predetermined factors. I don't see how the opportunity to rape prisoners fixes that issue for them</text>

    <text>This is exactly the answer.  Not only is the proposal suggested by the OP terrible on its face and flagrantly unlawful under any sane legal code, but it wouldn't even actually solve the problem it is being proposed to remedy.</text>

    <text>Incels don't actually want sex (Indeed, many incels are in relationships and have sex but still see themselves as incels because they're not having the type of sex or sex partners they think they need). The sex is just a proxy for their actual desire, which is power. They want to be so powerful that people want to (or have to) have sex with them on demand, because that validates their power.

That's also why they idolise chads to a borderline homoerotic level - they want to have the level of social power that they perceive chads as having.</text>

    <text>Can you give me a source showing that many incels are in relationships and have sex? That was not my impression of incels.</text>
