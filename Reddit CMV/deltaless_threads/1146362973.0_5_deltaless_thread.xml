    <title>CMV: Aaron Burr gets a bad rap</title>
    <original_poster>HotSauce2910</original_poster>
    <original_post>I feel like a lot of people have a really negative view of Burr, in large part because of Hamilton (which I do love btw : /). I think I mean this specifically that his reputation/legacy is negative relative to Hamilton's, at least from a progressive point of view.   


* He tried to abolish slavery in the 1780s as a NY Assemblyman and worked with the Manumission Society. He was admittedly hypocritical here, being a slaveowner himself (so fuck that). But Hamilton's relationship with slavery was also [pretty complicated](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a33023827/was-hamilton-a-slave-owner/). Despite that, I think there is a perception out there that was clearly anti-slavery while Burr was clearly pro-slavery. 
* Burr was a feminist. He was a big fan of Mary Wollstonecraft, believe that women were intellectually equal to men (which was rather radical at the time), and wanted equal education opportunities. Apparently Hamilton attacked Burr over this opinion. 
   * Wikipedia also says he submitted a proposal to give women the right to vote, but w/ no citation and I couldn't find a source that confirms it. 
* He started the first bank that extended credit to small businessmen instead of just the aristocracy. His methods/motives were dubious, but the result were meaningful. Hamilton, as I understand it, was rather elitist and wanted a strong aristocracy.
* Burr supported the rights of naturalized citizens and opposed a constitutional amendment (that the Fedarlist party was pushing) to bar naturalized foreigners from holding office. 
* He was accused of ["'revolutionizing the state,' because in the state legislature he backed progressive policies for funding internal improvements such as roads and bridges, debtor relief, and establishing a more democratic method of electing state senators."](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/03/30/liberals-love-alexander-hamilton-but-aaron-burr-was-a-real-progressive-hero/)     


I am curious about if I'm just missing something, if I just drank some counterculture kool aid, or if there's something actually here.   


Also, I noticed after typing out the title that it almost counts a pun... was not intended...</original_post>

    <text>I see you already gave out deltas, so I won't be too long here. Also I'm not an expert on Burr. So maybe I'm missing some context of your admittedly positive points you put here. Let's examine one of those points.

&amp;gt;Burr  was a feminist. He was a big fan of Mary Wollstonecraft, believe that  women were intellectually equal to men (which was rather radical at the  time), and wanted equal education opportunities. Apparently Hamilton  attacked Burr over this opinion.  
  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;Wikipedia  also says he submitted a proposal to give women the right to vote, but  w/ no citation and I couldn't find a source that confirms it.

There's nothing truly concrete here. I don't know much about the extents of Burr's so called feminism, but all you've described is exactly the kind of position I'd expect Burr to take: a feigned progressive stance. Was there any specific outcome that could be attributable to Burr's feminism? Or is it more likely that this was something he openly said because he wanted to appear favorable to a certain voting block? Like he did when he switched parties, because all he wanted was to be important/have power.

I can basically make the same version of this argument for most of your points. All these things are ideas he espoused, but built nothing concrete around. I don't even mean legislative. That's not the only way to enact beliefs. Ultimately, these are just words on a page. While the words Hamilton put on the page changed the formation of the United States. And Burr killed him.

Also, HA! I didn't notice your pun in the title either. Good one.</text>

    <text>He introduced legislation to give women the right to vote.  It’s hardly Burr’s fault it didn’t pass given the climate at the time.  He also gave his daughter the same education an male would have received, a very radical proposition.  And his letters to his daughter show the respect he had for her mind and opinions and advice.</text>
