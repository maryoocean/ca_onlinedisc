    <title>CMV: it's problematic when Americans claim other national identities as their own, purely due to their ancestors country of origin.</title>
    <original_poster>liltooter</original_poster>
    <original_post>Trying to understand the American tendancy to say they are Italian/ Irish/ Scottish, even if they've never been there. How much of this is culture, how much of this is upholding damaging stereotypes of other nationalities?

So I know this could be a potentially touchy subject for some, but it's a topic that invokes a lot of different emotions from me, so I'd like to hear some genuine American opinions on this.

As a Scottish person, when I meet Americans that tell me that they are also Scottish I can sometimes find it a but frustrating. Context is key of course, but I've had someone tell me that they are Scottish "too" because an ancestor way back when came from here to America. Its then often met with the American spouting off dated and offensive stereotypes to show me how Scottish they are. 

I don't know how many times I've come across people talking about being from this Clan or the great great great great grandson of a Clan chief. Or people proudly perpetrating redundant perceptions of Scottish people, and feel entitled to do so because they are "Scottish". I just don't like it. Clan history is Scotland is one ancient part of it. God there's so much I can say on that but I'll move on.

I've got a few Irish friends and this seems to be an even bigger phenomenon for them. I think with the troubles and Irish suppression there seems to be more 'cause' to get behind, as well as the identity.

Now don't get me wrong, I can appreciate that America is a melting pot/ salad bowl culture. Your country isn't as old as mine, infact we have universities that outdate your nation. So I guess in that sense communities can retain identities in different ways. Plus a lot of immigrant communities from the old world have grown round where the ships would dock. People settled together with the people they left with. So purely down to those historical/ geographical facts, I get why there is no 'one' American identity.

I know that A LOT of immigrant communities experienced hardship, racism, otherism and were left to live in squalor. These immigrant communities worked hard to build sustainable lives for themselves. Forged careers and businesses that became iconic within America ie Italian food. Irish pubs etc.

I can totally see the relevance to identifying as Scottish American, Italian American or Irish American. Unique communities, with unique identities that are deserving of their own American label. I guess this would make 'American' an umbrella term? 

However, I genuinely find it problematic when Americans equate their ancestral identity as meaning they are entitled to identifying with the stereotypes of the homeland.

To use Scotland as an example. We are a very socialist nation. We have a very complicated national identity within the landscape of the UK. We face serious, and I really do mean serious, issues relating to drug and alcohol abuse. We have contributed to colonialism and we have also been suppressed. What it means to be Scottish changes drastically between the East end of Glasgow and the West End of Edinburgh. I believe my countries issues are often over simplified and over commodified on the international level. I just don't like it when people misinterpret what it means to be Scottish because they are viewing it through the rose tinted glasses of ancestral love.

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate it when Americans take part in our culture. We love that yous love us. I can't speak for other communities but I know across Europe, its widely accepted that its rude when Americans expect to be accepted as a part of the old countries communities. That we are expected to act excited when yous "come home", welcomed "back" so it were. It almost comes across entitled, that you assume you know us so well, when what you know has been passed down to you from generations.

This obviously excludes people who are dual nationality. Or are raised in 1st/2nd and in some cases 3rd gen immigrant households.

I'd also like to note that there IS a distinction between journeying to view the land of your ancestors, and coming to a country and expecting to be viewed as part of that community without little to no assimilation.

So enlighten me, is there more to this I'm missing?</original_post>

    <text>I see you've never been to the states and as a Scot who emigrated here I wish there was something I could say to CYV, but I can't, I can only commiserate.  When I was still home I witnessed much of what you describe and thought, over here, it would be different.  Melting pot, aye?

Pffft!  It's a hundred times worse.  The moment I open my mouth and my native accent appears I get bombarded with the same shopworn stereotypes that you get.  Someone's umpty-ump great-grand-auntie was a &lt;insert clan name here&gt; so they assume that they somehow understand MODERN Scotland through their DNA.  Or worse, someone claims kinship to me because one of their distant relatives married one of my distant relatives in the 1700s.  I get asked about haggis, kilts, bagpipes continually and can see the disillusionment when I say I'm not particularly enamoured with any of them.

I now use RP consistently instead of my normal Doric cadence and as a result, tend to be mistaken for either English or South African.  Both errors are an improvement over being correctly identified as a Scot.

Your view doesn't need to be changed, sadly, it's correct.</text>

    <text>Aye I'm glad you get me. I'm getting named a bigot for refusing to make sweeping statements on behalf of communities I have no part in.

I'm sorry you've had this experience. Please don't lose touch of your Scottish culture. Don't let the Americans dominate it either. We are not a commodity, we are a very proud people.</text>

    <text>I can halfway understand it, although I don't condone it...this is the land of generalisations, after all.  And I think it's difficult for Americans, so many don't travel overseas and are only familiar with their own, and ONLY their own, culture to be able to understand the TEMPORAL stereotypes most Scots labour under.  

Many assume they know us based on what's depicted in media, Braveheart. Outlander, even Star Trek, but none of those depictions are set in current day Scotland.  No one would expect an American to live in accordance with Revolutionary War standards.  But Scots, and our Keltic cousins the Irish, are supposed to be culturally extant to the "glory days" of 1314 (hot and cold running leprosy and plague, whee!)     

Doesn't help that we voluntarily promulgate the stereotypes in the name of commerce either.  Princes Street...the Royal Mile...even Rose Street ffs...all pander to tourists.  You can't even escape it in Aberdeen, do YOU need a "fit like?" fridge magnet?  I sure don't.  

You post resonates loudly with me, but it's owing to shared experience, I'm not certain people who don't share it and haven't experienced life as a characterture can approach the problem from a position of understanding though.</text>
