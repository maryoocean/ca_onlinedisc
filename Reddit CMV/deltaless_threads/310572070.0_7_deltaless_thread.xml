    <title>CMV: Every straight girl out there secretly wants to date a rich guy</title>
    <original_poster>windmill230</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let's be honest here. Some girls say that they have no desire to date rich guys as they are looking for true love but really they are just lying. And as for girls who don't pursue rich guys, they secretly want to do this and the only reason why they did not do this is because they know that rich guys are out of their league.

Some people say that money is not a priority but really it is. Who doesn't want a rich husband who treats you nicely? "Money cannot buy happiness" is just a myth propagated by not-so-well-off people with a sour grapes mindset. The truth is deep down, everyone values money and secretly desires to be rich. I don't believe it when a girl says that she has no particular desire to date rich guys.

    <text>Really the only way you'll be forced to realize otherwise is by meeting someone who truly doesn't care about being rich. Those people do exist, because let's face it - not everybody thinks that having money is the primary goal in life. 

Money is merely a means to an end, and having a lot of it makes it very easy to forget what really matters. People with a lot of money typically forget about those things, therefore making them unattractive, depending on the person. 

I can just speak from personal experience - I grew up in a rich, white area, and afterwards moved into a more urban environment. I cannot stand many of the people I know from home, because of how insincere and cold they usually are, without even realizing it.

Is money a perk? Sure! But it typically brings with it other characteristics that you have to weigh in. Some think it's worth it, others don't. But people of both persuasions *do* exist.</text>
