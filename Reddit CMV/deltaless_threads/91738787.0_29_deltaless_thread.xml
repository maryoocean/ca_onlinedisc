    <title>Women are the inferior gender. CMV</title>
    <original_poster>TyKillsTyGoT</original_poster>
    <original_post>This is an issue I have really struggled with since adolescence and would love to have my views changed. I'm sexist. No bones about it. I know that I should think women are equal and holding these views makes me less civilized, but I haven't been able to find any evidence that would change my mind. 

The smartest people are men. The strongest people are men. It seems like women are average while men can excel or fail spectacularly. Harvard president Larry Summers agrees that men are better suited for certain difficult tasks.

I really want to be able to look at women as people but whenever I see a pretty woman in a nice car, I automatically assume someone bought it for her. When I see a woman out shopping, I wonder what her spouse does to afford her these priveledges. 

The women in my life seem to support this hypothesis. I know some girls who are very smart, but they're not on the level of the smartest guys I know. I also know some girls who are very physically fit but once again they cant compare to the fit men I know and research agrees with both of these points. 

I want to get over this beleif because I feel like it is tainting all my interactions with women and as a result the view is being reinforced more and more each day. 

So please reddit, CMV.</original_post>

    <text>Larry Summers is the one famous graduate of my high school and me and a few friends had one very serious 1 am conversation about what you said. For half of this I'll assume what you think about women having a lower standard deviation is true and why that doesn't necessarily mean inferior, then I'll explain why I don't think it's true. I would also mention that your sample size to support the hypothesis is way to small, and I'd also be willing to be that you know more women than men. 

First there was actually a study done where they interviewd people with the question (paraphrasing because I don't remember the exact quote) you have a kid, there iq is along a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of your choice (large or small). An overwhelming number of people chose the small standard deviation. So if you think the inferior option is the one that was chosen by most people, that'd mean most people disagree with you in whats superior vs inferior.

Second and most importantly, there's no evidence to support your (or Larry's) conclusion that it is a genetic difference. No relationship has been found between y chromosome and brain function [source](http://www.benthamscience.com/open/toneuroej/articles/V002/20TONEUROEJ.pdf) . In fact, there are genetic reasons to believe than men are actually **inferior** (in a very loose sense of the word) because having only 1 x chromosome makes men much more likely to get x linked diseases like me being colorblind or more serious conditions like hemophilia. Evolutionary having 2 chromosomes is hugely beneficial and men don't have that in sex chromosomes. </text>
