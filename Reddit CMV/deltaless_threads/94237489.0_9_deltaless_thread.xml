    <original_post>I believe everyone is racist just some people are more racist than others.

No matter how tolerant we try to be we are all ignorant to certain group(s) and because of that ignorance we make assumptions about certain groups of people.


As human beings we still have the primitive instinct to attack or run away from anything that looks different than us and in this case people who look different from us.

We all make assumptions.  For example, if you live in a predominately white neighborhood and you happen to see a group of black people hanging out you will notice something is a bit off.  These black people might be law biding citizens who isn't doing anything wrong but you don't know that.  You can say the same for any race but the point is if you see something "different" it will stick out to you and everyone else.  The same example can be the other way around and there can be a group of whites in a black neighborhood and that will stick out and you'll still make assumptions.

    <text>I think you're confusing race and culture. In your scenario, you only mentioned the fact that they were black. If I were to guess, I would assume you were imagining them with sagged pants, wife beaters, tattoos, etc. Am I right?

Now, in this scenario, it would not be racist to judge them. You're making a judgement on them based on their behavior and the way they're dressed (I'm assuming). This is a judgment of their culture (specifically inner-city black culture), not their race. Judging them based on their culture would be like assuming a group of men wearing suits and ties in the city are probably financially successful and contribute positively to society.

Obviously, if you made this negative judgement on a group of black men who presented themselves positively, that would be racist. But hey, everyone's a little bit racist:
