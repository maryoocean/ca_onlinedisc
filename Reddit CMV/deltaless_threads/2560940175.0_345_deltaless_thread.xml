    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>Bringing this kind of regional politics to classrooms in Europe on part of a professor is inappropriate. The professor is in a position of authority over a student. Here they used that to critique a student unfoundedly.

People from USA are called Americans across all Europe. There are no exceptions as there no other words for these people. Except from calling them Yankees sometimes, perhaps.

Everyone knows that American refers to people from the geographic area of the USA. There are no implications whatsoever that this would impinge on sovereignity of othet American states. I am well aware of the colonial feelings of South American states, but generally in Europe these are viewed as fully independent. There are no imperial perceptions to correct, as people are usually not so aware of what the US has been up to in the region.</text>
