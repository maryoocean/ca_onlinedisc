    <original_post>Every now and then, I see the odd post, "If the top 1% gave up their profits, we could cure world hunger" or something ridiculous like that. I dont know why people that have less expect people that have more to help them. Why should they? 

Edit: better example. 

Edit: my C got Ved, /u/amemut explained it in a very pragmatic manner that I could agree with. </original_post>

    <text>Because they have more to give. If you are carrying a heavy load the strongest guy would presumably take the biggest share.</text>

    <text>I agree, but what if the only reason that guy is strong is due to the fact that he carries more loads than you everyday. He keeps getting stronger. Until he's carrying such a load, that not everyone even has to carry anything. Then the others get weak. And eventually he says, fuck it, I'm not carrying your shit.</text>
