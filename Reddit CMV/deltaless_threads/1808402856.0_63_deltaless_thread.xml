    <title>CMV: Fredom of speech is far more important than a few people being offended</title>

    <original_post>Freedom of speech should be protected and kept, there shouldn't be people arrested for anti trans comments or insulting a soldier/soldiers, or for nazi jokes, or racist remarks or jokes.

Those should all be handled between people, if someone says stuff you dont like you handle it, simply block them or avoid them, theres a whole world you can be in and that persons in a very tiny part of it. 

It makes me nervous seeing people arrested and charged for saying things. It's only leading us to a place where we can be arrested for saying whatever the government doesnt like. And they shouldn't be in that much power to effect our communication with eachother. 

I live in scotland and dont feel I have freedom of speech anymore. 

(For the record I'm a white woman who's bi and have trans thoughts ig for those folks who say it never has been about me, it has sometimes, and in more ways than just those)

Edit: No it's not just anti trans people, Yes I believe crimes other than hate crimes involving speech should be illegal (threatening violence, doxing, defamation) but I also believe insults, jokes and bad takes or thoughts should not be.

Edit 2: Consequences for what is said like losing a job, getting insulted, losing friends ect is totally fine I just dont think the Government should be in charge of what can get you arrested in this sence.

Edit 3: I live in SCOTLAND in the UNITED KINGDOM or in BRITAIN depending what you say, I'm not american, im also not here advocating for my right to be a dick, im just saying the government arent the ones I want saying what I cant say, I mean twitter can destroy lives without them anyway.</original_post>

    <text>The problem with Freedom of speech is that it is contingent on good faith discussion for it to achieve its goal (to allow different points of view to shape the world for the better). Unfortunately, this is not always the case.

To take a non-controversial example, a person who is willing to falsify data to achieve a political aim (say, to claim that black people are inherently less intelligent than whites) should probably be excluded from academic discussion, not merely because they are wrong, or even because they are dishonest, but because they are working to make it harder for black people to contribute their own point of view.

The same might go for verbal harassment. Disagreement is necessary, but harassment can work to limit people's ability to contribute their ideas for reasons other than the quality of those ideas.

Now the problem is, it's not always clear whether a statement is passionate disagreement or harassment, and the truth of the matter is often less of a decider than who has to power to silence one party (and of course, who they agree with).

However, that is the rationale at play here. Offensive language has the power to effectively silence people without refuting their ideas or engaging in good faith, and therefore it can be necessary to remove it from the conversation in order to reap the true benefits of free speech.</text>
