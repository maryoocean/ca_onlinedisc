    <title>CMV: If gender is a social construct, then so is race</title>
    <original_poster>BoppeBoye</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let us take, as a given, that gender is divorced from the circumstances of your birth, that it is not a mental illness, and that there is no biological basis for what gender identity someone should express. Have I phrased that effectively? I'm trying to be concise, but I want to portray that premise correctly.

Why, then, should race be different than gender? If race carries with it "shared experience" and "lived experience", etc - that assumes that the only way you could understand what it's like to be a minority is to have lived your entire life as that particular minority. I'm not arguing against that, I agree that there are certain experiences that I could not comprehend - for instance, overbearing &amp;amp; strict Asian parents with exceedingly high expectations. 

But, if someone can change their gender or decide (?) that they identify as a different gender without having the prior lived experience of said gender, then why can't someone identify as a different race?

I'm not able to encompass all the variables which could lead someone to identify as another gender, but is it not possible for someone to come to the same conclusion with their race? What if an Indian man grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood, saw or experienced the same (or similar) discrimination as them, had minimal exposure to Indian culture; and this led him to conclude that he identifies more closely as a black man, rather than Indian? 

I would also like to cite Rachel Dolezal, who was uniformly mocked for being (afaik) the first trans-black woman in the public eye. It seems similar to transgender discrimination to me, assuming that there is something wrong with her mentally for deciding to become a black woman... Anyway, I'm not really defending her because that's not really in line with what I described in the previous paragraph (she grew up privileged IIRC), but the public reaction of mockery goes against the leftist belief of acceptance, by my perspective.

So, in short, why can there be no such thing as trans-racial people, the same way there are transgender?

    <text>You're logically consistent. **Assuming** gender is socially constructed, it should **imply** that race is socially constructed. Under the **assumption** that both identities are equivalent. This is to say, "Gender identity and racial identity" are no more than just "identities". Identities being, "things you mentally perceive based solely on societal norms."

But here lies the issue with your argument. 

&amp;gt; "things you mentally perceive based solely on societal norms."

Can you really argue that race is constructed purely from societal norms? 

When put in society, do we really see a difference between the actions of Black people compared to Asian people (treated on an individual bases)? Not really. People act like people for the most part. There might be a few differences, but it's usually based in tradition, not because society **forced** them into some sort of role. 

When put in society, do we see a difference between men and women? Yes. We see a clear difference in roles. Men are breadwinners, women are care-takers (in general).

Now if we isolate two people from society, can you argue that anything will change? The usual argument is that two people, 1 man 1 woman isolated from society, they would act the same, hence society defined their differences. If you isolate two people, 1 Black, 1 Asian, would there be a change? Did society really shape them? I think they'll act the same, and concluding that their mental state was not really changed from being in society or not.

That is where (I think) the premise falls apart.</text>
