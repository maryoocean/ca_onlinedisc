    <title>CMV: The question of "do we live in a simulation" doesn't matter</title>
    <original_poster>mix_420</original_poster>
    <original_post>I say this for two reasons:

1. You can't prove it. Can't really think of anything you can't explain with common sense that proves that we live in a simulation.
2. There's no point in it. I don't see how life changes in any way if you were to know you were in a simulation. I understand that knowledge is a great thing and we should try to get knowledge even if it doesn't matter, but because of #1 it makes it pointless.

Basically what I'm saying here is there's no point in asking this question if you will never have the answer to it, considering the only reason to ask the question is for the knowledge of it, as you'll never achieve it.</original_post>

    <text>We don't know whether it matters or not and it depends on the type of simulation.

This is really far out there, but if the sim was pulling feedback for our universe and was feeding it data, you may be able to find bugs that can be exploited.

Imagine finding a buffer overflow exploit in the universe that allows you to execute random simulation code. Imagine in the "real world" you're actually a real person who has been forced into the simulation, and you could physically "hack" your way back to reality.</text>
