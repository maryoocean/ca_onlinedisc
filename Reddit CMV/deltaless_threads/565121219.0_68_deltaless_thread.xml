    <title>CMV: it is a jerk move to play music while camping within earshot of other campers.</title>

    <original_post>We put a tent up in a state park campground for about 4 weeks out of the summer. Most of the time you can just hear nature, people talking, kids playing, lots of birds and squirrels  . Every 5th day or so, there is someone who brings some Bluetooth speakers so they can listen to music , but loud  enough  that people in a half dozen sites nearby get to ‘enjoy’ whatever they are playing. 

Right now I’m cooking dinner and the guys next to me are playing U2, Dave Matthew Band and similar inoffensive crap.

This would be entirely normal in a backyard gathering, but once you reserve to be in a public campground, it becomes selfish, intrusive,  rude.

Am I wrong?

(I know it’s a known risk of car camping. I’m not really  mad. More rolling my eyes. I wish they’d shut that crap off.  )

    <text>I would say that it is unreasonable for you to expect to have a quiet experience communing with nature in a public campground. I don't think anyone goes camping there and assumes that they will be getting away from the pollution of other people including loud music. Maybe there was a time once when people had some common decency and consideration for other people, but that isn't how it works now. Everything is now "fuck you, got mine." 

If you're looking to camp, I highly suggest going onto BLM land. It's not a state park, but you'll have a much better experience. </text>
