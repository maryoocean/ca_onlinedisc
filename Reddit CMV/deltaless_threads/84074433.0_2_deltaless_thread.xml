    <title>I believe real Christians died out centuries ago, CMV.</title>

    <original_post>That is to say, if real Christians ever existed in the first place. If you are a Christian, you must follow the teachings of the bible. You must follow the teachings of Christ. A real follower of any religion should follow that religion, not pick and choose what bits interest them. As soon as you can say "this works" and "this doesn't", you're not following the rules!

I believe anyone who works on the Sabbath, has piercings or tattoos, wears cotton/polyester blends, has a same-sex relationship, allows a woman to teach, or allows a woman to speak in church, etc. And says they're a Christian is lying.

I am certainly not saying that anyone should actually follow these rules, but I am convinced you are simply being dishonest if you call yourself a Christian, or a member of any religion, without following the rules that were clearly put out to you under that religion. Anyone that chooses to nit-pick the parts of their religion that they choose to follow is nothing more than a deist with a book they like. You are not a follower unless you are a follower!

Update: Between /u/TheophilusOmega and /u/Ausfall my view has changed. I feel the easiest way for me to word this is my analogy that the Bible is not a rulebook to Christians, but a textbook. They don't follow it to a T because they don't have to. Jesus' teachings is the lesson, and the Bible is the textbook in which his teachings and the Biblical historical relevance is told. Assuming that a Christian must follow the rules of the Bible exactly, else they are not a 'true' believer, is fallacious reasoning as shown by /u/ausfall, and between the two of them I've learned what actually separates following the Holy Book to following the Religion itself. I feel the points were put across strongest and clearest by these two Redditors, but thank you to everyone else who contributed.</original_post>

    <text>Religions evolve, and they are defined by what those who self-identify with that religion define it as. I doubt any sizable group of christians has ever said that they follow every law in the bible to the letter and without hesitation, but this doesn't mean they don't follow the book. 

For a different example, look at the American Republican Party. It has been around for over 150 years, but its values and goals are now completely different from its foundations. Does this mean that no modern republican is a true republican? I would argue that if you conform (to the best of your abilities) to the group consensus on the meaning of your organization, then you are a true member. 

Now if we were to be discussing whether modern christianity is true christianity, then your argument would be valid, but holding modern christians to the original standards of chistianity is... challenging.

For a more extreme example, consider humanity as a whole. Anatomically modern humans have only been around for a short period of time. But other humans were around before the most modern sub-species. Does this mean no living person is a true human, because we do not match up with the definition of the first homo sapien? </text>

In this case, I personally believe that no, we're not the same as a "true human", only carry the name. Although I would change it around that we are the "humans" and the ancestors were simply "homo sapiens", but that's a preference.

As for the American Republican Party, that's a political party. Any religious group that claims to conform to an ultimate, divine third-party, should be following the rules of that divine third-party, not their own rules. The whole point of religion (read: Abrahamic monotheism) is to adhere to the rules of your "one true god". If an ultimate creator exists, public opinion should be meaningless. Because of this, I don't think it's right to compare a political party to a religious group. A political party is allowed to form and change views over time whether it keeps the same name or not. A religious group is governed by something "holy" and "divine" that is superior to humans. Humans should not be allowed to pick and choose what they like about the rules of their superior ultimate being. Especially if they don't want to risk being called out on whether they take their religion seriously. </text>
