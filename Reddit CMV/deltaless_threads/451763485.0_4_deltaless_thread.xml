    <title>CMV:Moral objection to infidelity is probably only superficial</title>

    <original_post>EDIT-Infidelity isn't really an appropriate word to use here, so to avoid confusion I will clarify that it is more a question of the act of polygamy than of going behind someones back necessarily. 

 I'd like to preface this by saying I don't especially condone anything that will upset or destroy a relationship, nor have I experienced infidelity from either end (though I have seen family go through it.) but from a practical point of view, I don't really understand what is 'wrong' about. Firstly, Monogamy and promiscuity are fairly widespread in society. They are supposedly linked to testosterone levels in both men and women, because of this scientists often debate that it is to difficult to classify humans into monogamy or promiscuity. However they also agree that monogamy is a recent occurrence (Within a few thousand years). This suggests that it is driven by the emergence of society and changing views of religion. (Though as we know even the 'devoutly religious' could get away with promiscuity. King Henry eight is an unfortunate example.)

Of course, monogamy has obvious benefits, that is, two parents are better than one for raising a child, and compared to r select animals, humans are very helpless when they are born and take a lot of energy to raise, definitely k select. However I use the word infidelity in the title because I'm not referring to those who would have children then move on to a new sexual partner. More the secret act people take in of sleeping with another partner, hidden because of the moral view against it.

Humans for one, don't actually value children as the prime goal of sex anywhere near as much as they used to, but more importantly I think is that promiscuity in human relationships doesn't seem to constitute moving on or 'breaking up' by any necessary means. There's even examples of families quite honest and accepting of polygamy, or just relationships. These are of course uncommon and I am not promoting them, simply pointing out that they are quite possible.

 So what is the harm done then by sleeping outside of a relationship? Pride is the clearest answer, people feel as though it means they are less loved or aren't providing for their partner. But that's not a particularly good reason to think your partner doesn't love you if this behavior is natural to some and not to others.In fact it's also suggested that promiscuity can be inherited from a parent. So in that case, it's not so much a matter of values and not loving ones partner as a natural urge. It would be better if this was discussed with openness instead of men or women going behind their partners backs. This would erase a lot of the dishonesty paired with it, and with a shift in views might actually save a lot of relationships. So my question is, why do we view infidelity as amoral? Would it not be better to accept it as natural and discuss it properly with a partner? After all if someone still felt uncomfortable even without the weight of pride, society, or religion they would simply know sooner than if their partner had lied.


(I hope this isn't to sensitive for anyone and clarify that it's only a theoretical discussion.)

    <text>Infidelity is immoral because it is a breach of an agreement between you and your partner. If you agree to be exclusive to one another, then it is objectively dishonest to breach that agreement.

Now, polyamorous relationships or open relationships are not examples of infidelity, because the people in those relationships *know* what they're getting into from the beginning. They enter these relationships with the understanding that their partner will date other people, so there's no moral problem in this case.</text>
