    <text>the problem is that the aboriginals didn't get a say in the matter.

if an alien civilization colonized us, decimated our population and pushed us into the least fertile and least hospitable regions in our planet we would not be thaking them

if, overall, 1 in ten of us got the benefit of alien advanced tech, medicine and what not, but 9/10 of us got fucked would we be saying that "it was good for us?"

some of us, no doubt, but not really
