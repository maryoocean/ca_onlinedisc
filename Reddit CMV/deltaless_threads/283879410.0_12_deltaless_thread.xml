    <title>CMV: 'Jump scares' are a cheap party trick, and movies that are full of them shouldn't be considered horror</title>

Lately I've noticed that most horror movies rely on jump scares. Something will unexpectedly pop out at the audience, a loud noise will startle everyone, you know the works. Sometimes the movie tries to trick people into believing that a certain scene will have a jump scare, to make the viewer feel safe, and then do a jump scare in the next scene.

I think that movies like Paranormal Activity, The Conjuring and The Darkness do not do their best to scare the audience in a creative way.

Jump scares do something physical to your body. Sometimes my mom jumps out at the me when I walk through the door, to elicit a scream or a 'fear' reaction from me. However, a second later I'm just laughing because it's silly and not at all scary.

When I go see a movie at the theater that has a lot of jump scares, most of the audience members just seem to be laughing. You may hear a collective gasp or a scream, but that's just a reflex. 

Most movies riddled with jump scares do not leave an impression on me. I find them annoying.

Jump scares do not tell a story that sends shivers down your spine and causes you to lay awake at night. Jump scares do not show you a gruesome scene that will be burned into your mind for the weeks to come.

Jump scares are cheap party tricks. They are annoying and do not elicit any feelings of terror. 

Change my view.

    <text>Let me frame this answer by giving an example of what I think is a good use of jump scares in a horror film. Stanley Kubrick does this a few times in The Shining, but the first thing that pops into my mind is the scene where little Danny is riding his bike around the hotel, and there is a quick cut to the Twins appearing down the hallway. This scene is a master class in tension and how the score of the film adds to this tension. 

Horror, more than almost any other genre, relies on the effective use of music and a composer who can translate the voice of their director into the movie score. When jump scares are done right, the audience is already a little on-edge because the music is ratcheting up the tension, slowly but steadily you start thinking "oh shit, something bad is about to happen to this character" or "that shadow seems to be approaching them awfully fast..."

A good director won't have to show the audience all the gruesome stuff that happens to the characters in a horror movie. The audience doesn't need to be shown the Devil for them to believe the Devil exists, but a good composer will illuminate the afterglow of evil that is very much a part of this film world. Jump scares, when used properly, actually serve as an outlet to *relieve* this tension. If you're just tense the whole movie, it's going to be a rough ride. 

tl;dr: A good director uses jump scares to periodically relieve the tension in a horror movie, not add to it.</text>
