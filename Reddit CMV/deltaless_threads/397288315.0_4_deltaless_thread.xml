    <title>CMV: The ESRB rating system is frivolous and inaccurate</title>
    <original_poster>Aid2Fade</original_poster>
    <original_post>My parents prevented me from playing games rated above the ESRB required age. I don't think this was helpful or necessary, and in fact I experienced a short period afterwards where I specifically sought out games like CoD for the novelty of it. I understand that people may find the concept of violence grotesque, but video game violence is incredibly cartoonish. Not many people, or children I'd think, would belabor under the illusion that the silly video game blood on-screen has anything to do with what a realistic analogue would entail. I've even heard from people that it helps get aggression out of their system. Additionally, things like innuendo, violence, and 'bad language' are lumped together without any real way to differentiate. Even if I accept that there's benefit in controlling content, there doesn't seem to be a way for a parent that would want to pick one or two factors to actually choose. But beyond the value to isolated households, even if you tell your kids to not play M games, someone else's parent isn't going to care and will probably just let your kid play one at their house. Plus, if the concern is language and innuendo, they run into those at school anyway. And instagram is hardly sparing either. I just feel like the ESRB wasn't that useful at first and is now even more of a dinosaur.

    <text>I'm going to speak to the lady part of your post about parenting.

As a parent, I have games, behaviors, etc. that I do not condone. I am fully aware that outside of my watch, my kids may be engaging in things I do not approve of. However, the real part about not condoning it is that I am trying to influence the values of my children.

Example: I allow violent video games, but I do not allow GTA. When my kids have complained, I have explained to them that I cannot support a celebration of hoodlum-ism.

I know they have probably played it elsewhere, but the issue for me is not that they've played it. The issue is that I want them to know I don't condone the whole gist of the game-winning through criminal behavior.

I think it bears one more repetition: For me, it is not about making my kids follow rules. I want to teach my kids what I feel are important values. They will certainly challenge those values-which is natural-but I give them a foundation to consider as they learn about the world.</text>
