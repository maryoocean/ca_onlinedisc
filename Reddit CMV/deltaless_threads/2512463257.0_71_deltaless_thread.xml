    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>Prayer rooms cost more tax dollars to maintain for the school when the rooms could be used for education.

However, cross necklaces, hijabs, turbans, and jewish caps (i have no idea what they're called either) are all articles of clothing, and some religions require them. They are personal choices that apply to literally nobody else. To ban them is to discriminate based on religion, which is why most people disagree with things like prayer rooms.</text>

    <text>At my school the prayer room is just a regular classroom that happens to be free during prayer time. I imagine this is the same for most places but correct me if i am wrong.</text>
