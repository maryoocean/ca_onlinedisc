    <title>CMV: It is illogical to not believe in Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>LAMARR__44</original_poster>
    <original_post>Many people either believe in Hard Determinism or Compatibilism. I will argue that both are illogical.

Both argue that human actions are extensions of factors we do not have a choice over. Compatibilism seems to say we are still free but just redefines free will to the internal factors behind a decision, but the decision is still decided by a chain of events outside of our control.

My argument is a sort of wager argument. Either libertarian free will exists or it doesn’t. If it exists and we believe in it, we have made a free decision where we are right. If libertarian free will doesn’t exist, the decision to believe in libertarian free will was out of our control.

So either we have a choice and we can make the right choice, or we don’t have a choice and were determined to be wrong.

Thus it makes more sense to believe in libertarian free will since it’s potentially the only one where we have a chance to make a right choice, if determinism is true there is no choice, so there’s no value in being right.</original_post>

    <text>i'd go even further and say that there isn't anyone alive who genuinely doesn't believe in free will, because of how human beings operate.  we are born and raised as sentient beings with the power to affect our surroundings.  as a result, we assume that free will is the norm anyway.  determinism comes only from our lack of knowledge about something and the anxiety that that produces; that something we don't understand must have some reason behind it, therefore perhaps everything has some reason behind it that we can't understand. or, perhaps everything has some higher, supernatural, religious meaning behind it, that we do make ourselves then "understand". but no one really genuinely believes that.  because we all will things to be constantly.  we pick and choose when to use determinism based on when things are understandable at any given moment in time.    


it has value to believe in free will not because there's some silly psych study that proves it, but because it conforms to our inherent understanding of the world anyway.  our human brain has limits, and this is one of the limits that it places on us.  believing in ourselves as mechanical beings following a program contradicts the way our brain perceives the world.  so we subconsciously reject it.</text>

    <text>I genuinely do not think I could live without believing in free will. The amount of comments saying I should “choose” the logical choice just seems paradoxical. How can I choose without a free will? The whole concept of being a conscious agent goes out of the window. It’s more like you just have some weird awareness that isn’t actually you but a robot.</text>

    <text>Of course you could live without believing in the concept of libertarian free will. This thread is full of living people who are making compelling arguments that run counter to your POV.</text>
