    <title>CMV: Qu√©bec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Qu√©bec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>Forcing kids to take their crosses or hijabs off is just as bad as forcing an atheist to pray. The point if freedom, if a student wants to express their religion they should have the freedom to do so, just as an atheist should have the freedom to not follow anything that has to do with religion.</text>

    <text>We literally don‚Äôt have **unlimited freedom** in the exact way you‚Äôre pretending we do though.

Most high schools have a *no hats* policy. Judges can‚Äôt put on a Black Sabbath t-shirt before they go to bang the gavel. 

In order to be consistent with this incredibly arbitrary standard of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù you‚Äôve presented, why the hell would we allow companies and government agencies to enforce a *professional dress code* at all? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</text>

    <text>Because religious freedom is in almost every western constitution.</text>

    <text>Not every western country has the same arbitrary protections across the board.

In France, for instance, they have religious freedom enshrined in their constitution but they don‚Äôt consider being fully masked in public to be any more an ‚Äúexpression of religious freedom‚Äù as wearing a ski mask in a bank.

Suffice it to say, the idea of *religious freedom* doesn‚Äôt mean you get every chaotic permissibility you want just because you claim it‚Äôs ‚Äúof your religion.‚Äù</text>
