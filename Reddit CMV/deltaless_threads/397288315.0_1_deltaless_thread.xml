    <title>CMV: The ESRB rating system is frivolous and inaccurate</title>
    <original_poster>Aid2Fade</original_poster>
    <original_post>My parents prevented me from playing games rated above the ESRB required age. I don't think this was helpful or necessary, and in fact I experienced a short period afterwards where I specifically sought out games like CoD for the novelty of it. I understand that people may find the concept of violence grotesque, but video game violence is incredibly cartoonish. Not many people, or children I'd think, would belabor under the illusion that the silly video game blood on-screen has anything to do with what a realistic analogue would entail. I've even heard from people that it helps get aggression out of their system. Additionally, things like innuendo, violence, and 'bad language' are lumped together without any real way to differentiate. Even if I accept that there's benefit in controlling content, there doesn't seem to be a way for a parent that would want to pick one or two factors to actually choose. But beyond the value to isolated households, even if you tell your kids to not play M games, someone else's parent isn't going to care and will probably just let your kid play one at their house. Plus, if the concern is language and innuendo, they run into those at school anyway. And instagram is hardly sparing either. I just feel like the ESRB wasn't that useful at first and is now even more of a dinosaur.

    <text>Before criticizing the ESRB ratings, it's important to understand where they come from. Back in the SNES and Genesis days in the 90's, games like Mortal Kombat were being released and making a lot of legislators uncomfortable. There were calls to ban certain games. Companies like Nintendo would require games released on their systems to conform to certain restrictions because they were very worried about their image and didn't want the government to step in and start regulating them.

The ESRB was created by the major publishers as a voluntary system to rate games. They did this to cover their own asses, not to provide a valuable service. This allowed companies like Nintendo and Sega to stop censoring games on their systems because now they could defer to the ratings system rather than take heat for letting obscene things on their platform. It also helped prevent federal regulations from stepping in and taking control of their platform.

The rating system is terrible. The way games get rated is terrible. It exists because it was needed to defuse the threat of federal legislation. It was a token gesture and was totally the lesser of two evils.</text>
