    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

1. People are too sensitive. Yes, technically everyone from either North or South America is an American. And yes, people usually mean US citizens when they use that word because over time that association became the most prominent. It doesn't mean people are being racist, they're speaking the way they know how because of what they were taught and what everyone else says. It's annoying, but no harm is meant. 

2. The United States of America is a stupid, inconvenient name for a country, and our founding fathers should have come up with something less idealistic/grandiose and more suitable for language.</text>
