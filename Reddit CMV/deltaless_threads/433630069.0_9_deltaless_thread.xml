    <title>CMV: I should be able to sell my organs</title>
    <original_poster>stupidrobots</original_poster>
    <original_post>In short I should receive adequate compensation during life for use of my organs after my death.  The goal of this is to provide a financial incentive to increase the supply (and thus reduce cost) of organs required for transplant.  The benefits I see are as follows:

1) it gives the poor and disadvantaged a way to make money and get on their feet without requiring higher education or years of experience, relieving debts.

2) The financial incentive gives people reason to donate organs who might otherwise not.  This increases supply and drives down cost, and reduces time on waiting lists.  

3) A profitable program of organ collection would allow advertising for agencies that do this service and write up contracts, increasing the visibility of the needs of people who require organ transplants.

4) The argument that this creates a black market for organs is silly.  If someone wanted to kill you and take your organs, laws against it won't really help because now we're talking about maniacs.  

Furthermore my organs are my property, and I get to say what happens to my property during my lifetime and at the time of my death.  To deny this is to deny that individuals have the right to their own bodies.

    <text>I don’t think a one time payment of any amount would work as a business model. Let use some real numbers.
There are about 2.5 million deaths in the us per year. And about 45% of  the population are organ donors. That’s 1.1 million potential donors who die per year. However only about 25,000 transplants from deceased people per year (when one person donated 2 organs it counts twice) . Which suggests only 2% if potential donors are actually able to donate an organ.  Assuming average price per organ is 20,000 and they want 50% of that to pay for operations that leaves them with only $211 per average person. That is less than the cost of screening people. Befor you say $211 is a lot of money to a homeless person, that $211 would be for an averagely heathy person who is unlikely to take up drinking or smoking, not someone for which that would be a lot of money. </text>
