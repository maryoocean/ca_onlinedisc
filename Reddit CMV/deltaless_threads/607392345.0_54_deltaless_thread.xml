    <title>CMV: Legislative bodies should be required to explain, in formal writing, why they voted a certain way when it comes to legislation.</title>

    <original_post>I think publicly elected officials responsible for driving policy and legislation should be required to explain why they vote certain ways in writing. Voting along party lines is reprehensible regardless of the side. Politics shouldn't be a game about which side wins, but rather which fact-based opinions win regardless of sides. If the legislative bodies have no reasonable explanation for why they voted a certain way besides voting along party lines, they should not be allowed to vote because we have no reason to believe that they're not voting out of self-interest. If, for example, someone in Congress voted against what seems to be reasonable gun law without explanation, but you can see in their financial disclosure that the NRA contributes a lot of money and support for them, how are we to know that their vote was not influenced by the NRA without them explicitly citing so and explaining what other reason compelled them not to vote for said reasonable legislation? I'm not even asking for a long written response from them. A short paragraph or page summary with sources they're using to base their vote on is good enough. </original_post>

    <text>You really do not know how much the government publishes for the general public. For this, you want congress.gov and their Congressional Record. Here is [November 28](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record). If you really want to get into the nitty-gritty call your representative and ask. Please do be polite when doing this a poor intern in usually managing the phone and they will read you the statement on the issue.

The Supreme Court does something like this too its called a slip. Here is an example.

[WEYERHAEUSER CO. v. UNITED STATES FISH AND
WILDLIFE SERVICE ET AL. ](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-71_omjp.pdf)

Really utilize the information available to you by the government. It is not a secret. [GPO.gov](https://www.gpo.gov/) is a great tool and pretty much every agency will have a publications page.

Go to think tanks too. Yes, they do have a bias and some are better than others. Brookings Inst and AEI are your big guys. CATO, Heritage, Hudson, Carnegie Endowment for Peace, NDI, CSIS, RAND, Atlantic Council, Eurasia Inst, CFR are all very credible
