    <title>cmv: K-12 Educators push a false narrative that all college degrees are good investments</title>
    <original_poster>Suitable-Ad-8598</original_poster>
    <original_post>Students in high school are bombarded with pressure to go to college by educators, with high emphasis on the ranking of the schools they are accepted into and no emphasis on the majors that they choose.

Nobody is warning students that picking liberal arts majors (unless they go to an ivy league school or something like it), will probably make them financially worse off then not even getting a degree in the first place. I know a girl that did gender studies at Columbia and is working as a barista several years out of college and is in about $400,000 in debt. I went to a way worse school than Columbia and nearly all of my friends with liberal arts degrees are stuck working as cashiers and in food service. I know a ton of people who went to community colleges (which was highly frowned upon in my high school culture) who are making six figures a couple years out of school (STEM and sales).

Why are we not being honest with these kids about the consequences of incurring student debt in unusable majors? I am not saying people shouldn't have the right to make their own major choices, but this is like handing children a pack of cigarettes and not telling them it causes cancer.

Edit: I probably exaggerated when I said worse than no degree if we are talking about long-term in their lives—I kind of meant in place of certifications or bootcamps.  What I should have said is that the lack of jobs in liberal arts fields seems to not be communicated to kids, which has significant negative financial consequences.

    <text>The 2022-2023 estimated cost to attend Columbia University WITH room and board with ZERO scholarships of any kind is $85K a year. Your friend managed to spend $60K more than the current costs of going to Columbia for 4 years. Additionally I believe this is far more than they could take out as a student loan themselves as you can only get tuition costs so they would have needed a Parent Plus loan so this $400K tab is partly the fault of the parent. On top of all that - the average salary of a Columbia graduate is $89K. Your friend is a spectacularly outstanding extreme anecdote that is not in any way representative of the average case. (Gender studies is surprisingly a pretty decent career. I have no idea what they do but a few Google searches says there are only about 2,000 degrees conferred per year and they made an average of $55K per year). 

Meanwhile your other extreme example of community college graduates earning over $100K/ year after “just a few years” - again while possible is an amazing best-case scenario. 

A more accurate explanation is that your success is more tied to personal grit, drive, focus and your families socioeconomic status. (Family wealth doesn’t guarantee success but it gives you a much better chance).</text>

    <text>You do understand that $90k a year is basically the bare minimum to survive today, right? Assuming a $2000/ month rent, you can save $800 a month after expenses if you have no car loan, no going out, no sudden expenses, etc. It's actually quite depressing. With a $400k debt and let's say magically a 0% APR, it would take a little over 41 years to pay off that loan putting $800 into it a month. Literally the rest of what should have been your working life. I mean then you have no savings because all of it went to the loan. Did I mention only 15% of Americans make over 90k?</text>

    <text>$90K a year is bare minimum to survive??  Where the hell do you live, because median **household** income (which is usually two earners) is like $67K, which means at least 50% of the entire USA lives on way less than that.</text>

    <text>On a $2000 a month rent. Many places in America are cheaper than that, but on a $2000 rent it is indeed that much.</text>

    <text>That's only 24K a year.  Someone making 90K a year has probably 75K after taxes.  So the other 50K ($4,166 a month) after housing is paid for is just scraping by, huh?</text>
