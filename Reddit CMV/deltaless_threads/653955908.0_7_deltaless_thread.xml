    <title>CMV: Equastrian sports should not be part of the Olympics.</title>
    <original_poster>LarryAndBarry</original_poster>
    <original_post>The Olympics in my opinion, is to challenge the boundaries of a humans physical abilities and see who is the best of the best. Its amazing what the human body is capable of when pushed to it limits.

I understand the same level of commitment goes into being a horse rider, but I feel as though equastrian sports is more a test for the horses. In theory, a javelin thrower can use any type of javelin but still throw a winning shot, but a rider can't really do the same with which horse he/she will use, therefore relying heavily on the horses ability to perform as well as their own. In the same vein, why not include the traditional horse racing with jockeys into the Olympics. </original_post>

    <text>It takes a lot of skill and strength to ride an Olympic level horse. One of the top dressage horses in the world a few years ago was sold for an insane amount of money to a new owner who was unable to compete competitively on him. It's not just the horse doing the work out there. Humans use many objects to showcase their skills such as bows and javelins how is horse riding any less of a sport than others which utilize things outside of the human body? Sports are not entirely about strength and speed they are about skill and technique although i will add that it does really take strength to ride. Cross country events in particular are extremely exhausting for both horse and rider </text>
