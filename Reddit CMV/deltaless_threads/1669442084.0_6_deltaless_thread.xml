    <title>CMV: Kim Potter is guilty of 2nd degree manslaughter</title>
    <original_poster>StoopSign</original_poster>
    <original_post>The facts of the case aren't really disputed. She thought she grabbed her taser but grabbed her gun instead and shot Daunte Wright while he attempted to flee. Potter knew that it wasn't a lethal force scenario by *intending* to grab her taser and yelling "taser." If her years of experience taught her to use lethal force she would have not attempted to draw the taser, and she wouldn't have cried on the ground knowing she'd made a mistake. That's what it was. A mistake. A deadly mistake. 

"A person who causes the death of another by any of the following means is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than ten years or to payment of a fine of not more than $20,000, or both:

(1) by the person's culpable negligence whereby the person creates an unreasonable risk, and consciously takes chances of causing death or great bodily harm to another;"

Culpable negligence includes mistakes. Even honest mistakes. She's not charged with murder. She didn't need have to have criminal intent to commit 2nd degree manslaughter by way of culpable negligence.

Explained online:

"Examples of culpable negligence might include a healthcare professional giving a patient a medication that they are allergic to; a teacher leaving a class unsupervised, resulting in a child getting hurt; a car driver injuring someone in an accident that occurred while the driver was texting â€“ the list goes on, but the most infamous example of culpable negligence concerns firearms."

Edit: Just wanna point out how I'm totally part of a new stereotype of liberals/civil libertarians, who remember the incident, then get all confused by media portrayals of events and the possible mistrial. MSM is indeed bullshit. They never get down in the weeds. CourtTV is a bit better. I've amended my view to have some doubt on the jurisprudence side. I dunno if its a reasonable doubt. Some quantify reasonable doubt as a 10% doubt but every legal professional I've met says that's bs.

I do think everyone in that room except the jury has a pro-police bias. I think DAs were a bit eager to overcharge both Rittenhouse and Potter. This muddies the waters for jurors. I suppose there's something to be said for complaints about "actavist DAs." I want them to focus more on releasing non-violent offenders and not bow to public pressure and end up charging the woman with two crimes that are substantially similar. The key difference is whether she recklessly intended to injure and didn't care if he died (man 1) or whether she acted with disregard for any possible injury he could sustain (man 2). These states of mind are contradictory. Even though they are substantially similar. So the defense can easily assert a state of mind that falls short of culpability

I don't believe in lengthy sentences. 3yrs on the protective cop n snitch block is enough if convicted</original_post>

    <text>It could also be said that if she was so mistaken as to which weapon she was firing that she obviously didn't pay attention during her training. That training is specifically designed to prevent the very mistake she made and prevent unnecessary harm. By not insuring that she was proficient and blowing off her training she was negligent.</text>

    <text>The evidence in the case presented is that she's never missed a single class of training in her police career. Trainers have testified to her being active and attentive during lessons. No evidence was brought forth implying anything to the contrary.</text>

    <text>So, the first time she has to use it (according to  her own testimony this was the first time she wanted to draw her taser other than in training) she messes up. Must be something wrong with the training. I still have trouble figuring out how she could have been confused when the taser was on her LEFT side and had a different weight and shape from her service weapon. Bottom line, if someone is this nerve racked that they screw up that bad in the field when under duress, they shouldn't be on the force - time to retire.</text>
