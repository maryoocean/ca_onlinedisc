    <title>CMV: The Idea that Anyone Criticizing the Ghostbusters remake will be branded a misogynist is a fabrication, motivated by people's desire to feel persecuted by feminists.</title>
    <original_poster>MisandryOMGguize</original_poster>
    <original_post>So, as you may be aware, the new remake of Ghostbusters, a movie surrounded by controversy, has been released to critics, and reviews are beginning to come in. The reviews are decidedly mixed, the top critics catalogued by RottenTomatoes.com are split 6 to 7 on whether it's fresh or rotten, with the rest of the critics generally being more positive. 

Reddit of course has an interesting history with this movie, which largely consists of a circlejerk every time it's brought up about feminism, SJWs and political correctness. This has not changed since the movie was released, with people in every review thread talking about how anyone that positively reviews the film must be a feminist, or be terrified of the feminist backlash for being critical of it. [This](http://imgur.com/a/fKRXP) is currently one of the top posts on the ghostbusters sub.

I've not seen any actual feminists claiming any and all criticism must be rooted in sexism. I've seen feminists saying that the immediate backlash to a female cast, dismissing it as political correctness, etc is sexism, but never the idea that any criticism is sexist. In fact, most of the feminists I've seen are fairly mixed, thinking the trailers weren't that funny, and that the black character's position in the crew plays on racial stereotypes.

So, I'm pretty sure that most of this is just reddit being reddit and jerking itself off about how edgy it is to go against the "feminist agenda," but I'd kind of like to believe I'm wrong, and that I ought to have more faith in people, so CMV. Have there been people being slandered just for not liking the film? Is there some vast feminist conspiracy to censor people who don't like the movie, and have any of the people writing the negative reviews faced this? Since I'm sure this topic has been discussed before, I'm also interested if anything has changed since the actual reviews were released.

    <text>There are plenty of people saying a lot of people who are attacking the new Ghostbusters film are sexist. The thing is, they also happen to be right.

Of course, not everyone who thinks the new film looks terrible are sexist, but there is definitely a sizeable, vocal minority who definitely are.</text>

    <text>It's terrible. And not because it's women playing the roles. </text>

    <text>Didn't say it was good or bad.

Just said that regardless of it's quality, a significant portion of the vocal backlash has come from sexists.</text>

    <text>Did they say they were sexist? Was there any indication of their disgust towards women?</text>

    <text>&amp;gt;Full Definition of sexism. 1 : prejudice or discrimination based on sex; especially : discrimination against women.

Plenty of this.</text>

    <text>Expressing dislike over a movie doesn't mean they are sexist. Now if they said " this movie is going to suck because they are all women" I would agree but until then how did you know they are sexist</text>
