    <title>CMV: it is a jerk move to play music while camping within earshot of other campers.</title>
    <original_poster>estheredna</original_poster>
    <original_post>We put a tent up in a state park campground for about 4 weeks out of the summer. Most of the time you can just hear nature, people talking, kids playing, lots of birds and squirrels  . Every 5th day or so, there is someone who brings some Bluetooth speakers so they can listen to music , but loud  enough  that people in a half dozen sites nearby get to ‘enjoy’ whatever they are playing. 

Right now I’m cooking dinner and the guys next to me are playing U2, Dave Matthew Band and similar inoffensive crap.

This would be entirely normal in a backyard gathering, but once you reserve to be in a public campground, it becomes selfish, intrusive,  rude.

Am I wrong?

(I know it’s a known risk of car camping. I’m not really  mad. More rolling my eyes. I wish they’d shut that crap off.  )

I WOULD LOOSE IT. The 2 worst bands. 

But as far as whether it’s a jerk move I think is totally dependent on context, the vibe of the campground, what weekend it is, etc. 

Personally I don’t bring tunes to just chill at the campground. But I mostly motorcycle camp, so at most I’ve got a small Bluetooth speaker. Also, I understand that the music I most want to hear when I’m drinking by a fire is probably not everyone’s thing. Unless we are camping at a metal festival or something. 

I am involved in amateur motor sports and I’ve always thought it was weird when some people blast music from their paddock space. 

Listen to the podcast Your Favorite Band Sucks, because to many others around you, it probably does. 

Now excuse me while I wake the neighborhood with Reign In Blood</text>
