    <title>CMV:13 Reasons Why is a terrible show</title>
    <original_poster>Schnippernyc</original_poster>
    <original_post>Despite all its acclaim, 13 reasons why is absolutely awful. Here is why I think so. 

1. Everyone praises the TV Show for its originality,  how original can it be if it's based on a book?

2. Far to many of the characters are two-dimensional. Hannah's the stereotypical drama queen, Bryce, Zac, Marcus... are the stereotypical popular boys. Tyler's the weird outcast. Justin's the troubled kid, and Jessica is the bad influence that drinks, smokes, and has underage sex that is perceived as an angel. They only tried to give depth to 6 characters. This sounds like a lot, but a show with such complicated social webs and so many characters should have them with more depth. That said here is a list of the characters they tried to  make dynamic.
   
  
     A. Tyler. Like I mentioned before, they failed at Tyler. They tried to make him troubled and worthy of sympathy. Instead, they made him a creep.
    
 
     B Courtney. When Courtney breaks down into tears in the cemetery, we are supposed to feel sorry for her. However, her insistence of acting like an asshole causes the viewer to think of her as a mean girl in sheep's clothing, not someone with complex emotions.
    
 
     C. Sherri, Alex, Clay, and Tony. This is an odd group but I am putting them together because they actually did have emotions. You may think that 4 characters with complex emotions is enough. It isn't for one interesting reason. Although the 4 character arcs are complex, they are all virtually identical. They all have human characteristics shown based on one thing, regret because of Hannah. They are all shown as human by this one trait. Their responses to regret are also similar. Two commit suicide or try to. As much as I try, I can not relate to the show's human-looking robots.
3. The entire plot is revolved around sympathizing with an asshole hungry for revenge. I know what I said before about Hannah being a drama queen, but she is also a terrible human being. Not only does she commit suicide, leaving all the people who care about her feeling guilty, she makes sure everyone who contributed knows about it. This is supposed to haunt everybody for the rest of their lives. Worst of all, this was done for no reason other than revenge. She clearly did not want anyone to know what happened to them, and for god-knows-how-long, they had to go to school with this over their heads, unable to tell anyone, "I helped kill Hannah Baker".

I am hesitant to chime in here as I haven't watched the series, but this thread seems quiet enough. From your comment I would challenge this criticism in particular. Recently there has been more of a trend in dramas to allow the protagonists to be more overtly terrible people we sympathize with which often leads to better television (feels more authentic/less pandering/wishful/idealistic), for a recent example Breaking Bad is often heralded as one of the best TV shows of recent times, its protagonist Walter White is a terrible person.</text>

    <text>It is true, but the difference between Walter White and Hannah Baker, is that Walter White is written to be an anti-hero, he is not meant to be a good person. Hannah was supposed to be given sympathy by the viewer. She was supposed to be a sweet, innocent girl, who was just out of touch with her emotions. However, the writers messed up and if you don't have sympathy for Hannah, the show falls apart, because you are supposed to be angry at the one-dimensional life-forms in the show. I almost felt sympathy for someone who has literally no characteristics other than being a bitch.</text>

    <text>I guess the question is how are you determining that Hannah isn't an anti-hero?</text>
