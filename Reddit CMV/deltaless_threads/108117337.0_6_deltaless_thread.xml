    <title>I believe anti-depressants change who you are as a person rather than fix you to the way you should be. CMV.</title>

I've taken anti-depressants before, but I don't feel like they made my brain work the way it's 'supposed' to. I think however my brain works naturally, without the use of medications, is its REAL natural state.

When I took anti-depressants, it changed the way I looked at the people in my life, the way I see how things work, even some of my opinions! I didn't feel like the ME I've been my whole life. But when I went off again, though I was depressed, I felt like myself again.

Since this experience, I've been unable to believe that depressants make you the way you're SUPPOSED to be. I feel that your natural state is acquired without the use of any medications. I'm a little old fashioned I suppose. Change my vieeeew?

How are you "supposed" to be? What makes the "natural" way your personality became assembled better or worse than any other? I feel two things are being assumed here that make it an illogical statement.

1) Beyond a certain degree to which you become not detrimental to society both small and large, the field of personality types is actually quite large and encompassing. Saying that you've actually changed your stance on a few things suggests that these beliefs are formed upon a base of that depression, and in a more logical mindset, will cease to make sense.

2) "Supposed" to be. You're making an assumption that something's natural state is the state best meant for it to be in. When the dice fall where they may, you don't have to accept snake-eyes as your result if nothing stops you from changing the dice.

People have assumed that "natural" is better in a universe full of things that only have meaning because we assign it to them. The only thing that matters is what makes you happy filtered through the realm of possibility. 

i.e.: It is likely you are happier on the anti-depressants, but feel guilty due to the concept of "natural is better". If you are happier, and no one is hurt or harmed, then do as ye will.</text>
