    <title>CMV: Every Disney Princess could be reasonably interpreted as a metaphor for mental illness or diagnosed as having one</title>
    <original_poster>DaisyChained23</original_poster>
    <original_post>Examples:

Belle- Stockholm Syndrome. Also maybe NPD (the scene where the villages are singing about how beautiful and special she is could be seen as a grandiose delusion).

Rapunzel - Anxiety (her "tower" is a mental one) and PTSD from an abusive mother.

Elsa and Anna- BPD. Anna is impulsive and reckless and doesn't really have a clear sense of identity. Elsa is impulsive in a different way and cold. They could be seen as two sides of "splitting".

Ariel- body dysphoria. She literally changes the entire lower half of her body.</original_post>

    <text>You *could* interpret what you see in Disney movies as metaphors for or behavior diagnosable as mental illness, but not any more reasonably than for literally any other human.

If you observe anyone long enough, you'll see behaviors that match DSM descriptions of mental illness, because mental illnesses aren't abnormal behaviors; they're normal behaviors taken to such an extreme that it significantly impacts the person's health. Seeing random snippets of behavior that matches a DSM description of a mental illness is not enough to reasonably assert mental illness is present.

Also, realize that personalities in movies are exaggerated so audiences can quickly and easily understand the character, and that metaphors are in the eye of the beholder - what you interpret may not be what the creator intended.</text>
