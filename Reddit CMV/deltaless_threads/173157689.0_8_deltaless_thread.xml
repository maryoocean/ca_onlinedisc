    <title>CMV:The media turns us into what we consume</title>
    <original_poster>ExploreMeDora</original_poster>
    <original_post>Marshall McLuhan coined the term "the medium is the message." This means that the form of a medium (cell phone vs newspaper) embeds itself in the message, creating a symbiotic relationship by which the medium influences how the message is perceived. McLuhan proposes that a medium itself, not the content it carries, should be the focus of study. He said that a medium affects the society in which it plays a role not only by the content delivered over the medium, but also by the characteristics of the medium itself.


With this concept in mind I ask that you challenge these statements:


1. Reading print media makes us more educated, as opposed to the digital media we revel in today.
2. Playing violent video games and watching violent films makes us more violent.
3. Watching television makes us less social.
4. Life online gives us popcorn brain.


Popcorn brain can be defined as a brain so accustomed to the constant stimulation of electronic multitasking that it becomes unfit for life offline, where things pop at a slower pace.


I welcome you to come up with other statements to challenge or to develop other counterarguments. Essentially, I believe that our media consumption strongly affects our identity.

To the contrary, I've learned a lot from since I've used the internet.

* Through tools like khan academy and wolfram alpha, I've learned calculus without taking college classes.
* With wikipedia, I've learned more about history than I did in my sociology and world history classes.
* With reddit, I've learned quite a bit from different subs like /r/compsci, /r/everymanshouldknow, and /r/IWantToLearn.
* There are so many crafting tutorials on youtube that I've learned to knit and crochet without an actual teacher.</text>
