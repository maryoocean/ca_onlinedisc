    <title>CMV: Life is meaningless, and there's no point to trying to prolong it as much as possible.</title>

    <original_post>Whatever we do, ultimately, has no meaning. In the grand scheme of things, we are but a tiny speck of dust on a meaningless planet.

That's why i say that trying to prolong life is absolutely useless. This includes tries to reanimate dying people, trying to find a special formula for immortality, and similar medical/engineering advances.

Instead of finding ways to prolong life, we could better spend resources to make the life we've got more pleasurable. This would be a much better way to spend our time and resources, by actively trying to become a better and happier society, where death is just part of the cycle, with no taboos attached to it.</original_post>

    <text>I agree that life is meaningless but to me, that makes it great. I live for no reason at all and can enjoy it. Prolonging life can help prolong such enjoyment for an individual, increase joy of life in other individuals who care for the one in question, plus methods for prolonging life also often improve quality of life and our general condition so we can enjoy it more.</text>
