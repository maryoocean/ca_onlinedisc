    <title>CMV:Freedom of speech should not be limited</title>
    <original_poster>shad0w-fax</original_poster>
    <original_post>I strongly believe that freedom of speech and expression must have no limits. Even in case if the speech is offensive to people. One can choose not to listen but not to take away my right to say it. Before someone suggest the "fire in a theatre",I recently came across with this speech of Christopher Hitchens and would recommend you to watch it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z2uzEM0ugY)
One big question is-who will be the one deciding that what is and isn't right to say? Who would you give authority to decide for you what is and isn't right to think and say?
Obviously, it is not an ideal case. Of course the best way is to have a perfect individual to make these decisions but, have we not seen that at last it always ends badly. That kind of authority would be tyrannical.
I would like to give analogy of democracy being imperfect as compared to a benevolent dictator BUT we know dictatorship always end badly. No one person should be given so much power.

That kind of authority would be tyrannical. 

We already give people the authority to imprison or kill people who break the community's rules. 

We give them authority to forcibly take away parts of our property as taxes.

We give them the authority to regulate what kinds of businesses we are allowed to run, with health, environmental, safety, and civil right regulations, and shut down the offending ones. 

Modern society already runs on a careful compromise between private freedoms and public concerns. You can call that tyrannical, but if we would only pursue personal liberty, the whole thing would crash and burn. 

The same applies to speech. Yes, freedom of speech is *a concern*. We should generally pay attention to allow an open discourse, and to give some options for the political minority to change minds. 

But at the same time, we have good practical reasons to prioritize public concerns over hiring hitmen, and making fraudulent ads, and committing plagiarism, and distributing lolicon porn in the park, even if all of these are technically forms of "speech". Striking a right balance is no more inherently tyrannical with speech, as with any other action, we still manage to regulate the excesses of those too.
