    <title>CMV: If gender is a social construct, then so is race</title>
    <original_poster>BoppeBoye</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let us take, as a given, that gender is divorced from the circumstances of your birth, that it is not a mental illness, and that there is no biological basis for what gender identity someone should express. Have I phrased that effectively? I'm trying to be concise, but I want to portray that premise correctly.

Why, then, should race be different than gender? If race carries with it "shared experience" and "lived experience", etc - that assumes that the only way you could understand what it's like to be a minority is to have lived your entire life as that particular minority. I'm not arguing against that, I agree that there are certain experiences that I could not comprehend - for instance, overbearing &amp;amp; strict Asian parents with exceedingly high expectations. 

But, if someone can change their gender or decide (?) that they identify as a different gender without having the prior lived experience of said gender, then why can't someone identify as a different race?

I'm not able to encompass all the variables which could lead someone to identify as another gender, but is it not possible for someone to come to the same conclusion with their race? What if an Indian man grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood, saw or experienced the same (or similar) discrimination as them, had minimal exposure to Indian culture; and this led him to conclude that he identifies more closely as a black man, rather than Indian? 

I would also like to cite Rachel Dolezal, who was uniformly mocked for being (afaik) the first trans-black woman in the public eye. It seems similar to transgender discrimination to me, assuming that there is something wrong with her mentally for deciding to become a black woman... Anyway, I'm not really defending her because that's not really in line with what I described in the previous paragraph (she grew up privileged IIRC), but the public reaction of mockery goes against the leftist belief of acceptance, by my perspective.

So, in short, why can there be no such thing as trans-racial people, the same way there are transgender?

    <text>Yes *gender has socially defined aspects (gender roles and gender stereotypes) but it arises from biology.* **Transgender is biological, hon. That's why. There are studies showing how transgender occurs at birth because of hormones, there's a heritability factor at play (that I'm too stupid to fully understand), and you can literally see on brain scans how trans peoples brains don't look like or work like the brains of cis people who share the same sex.**

"Transracial" is just some bullshit a disturbed white girl made up when she got caught in her lie. She can try to adopt an ethnicity but she cannot fully change her race unless she goes back in time and lives the childhood out a black girl. Even white passing people are adopting an ethnicity as non "natives" and not changing their racial background. 

**"Race" is a social construct, however, because we craft meaning around "racial"bgroups, which we also define arbitrarily, based on strange rules about physical appearance/phenotype and heritage. If you look at genotype data on "race" you'll see "races" have less commonality within a group than the do with members of ornery "racial" groups.** Ponder that hard now, cuz it is a *fact* which fairly effectively destroys every argument a white supremacist will try.</text>

    <text>Is it your view that only trans people who can pass a brain scan for transgenderism should be considered real trans people? 

Also... *everything* that makes us who were are takes place due to chemical reactions in the brain. J-roc from Trailer Park Boys, were he real, had some different shit - chemical shit that we could likely trace if we knew the first thing about how the brain really works - going on in his brain that made him think he was really black. </text>

    <text>Technically then everything is both. The genes are not social constructs. Men develop prostate cancer, women develop breast cancer, black individuals develop sickle cell at higher rates, and transgender individuals are born that way. This needs to be measured for scientific purposes and the genetic details are not constructs but biological factors. 

However some people choose to be transgender that are not, some women develop autism or prostate cancer , shades of color range highly in individuals and change all the time through reproduction and evolution. There is a spectrum of sexualities, colors, orientations etc. and these words we use in society can't begin to accurately portray what are DNA is fully comprised of. But our job is to do the best we can. To distinguish as much as possible what is based in studies, what might be slightly biased, and what is down right ignorant. </text>
