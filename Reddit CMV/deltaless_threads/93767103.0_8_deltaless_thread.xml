    <original_post>This is something I've believed for a while. As a species, humans are self-destructive. We procreate too much and consume too many resources. I believe that something like China's one-child policy should be instituted in as many countries as possible to curb population growth. ~~I think currency should be done away with and governments should provide housing and necessities while the population works for the betterment and survival of humanity as a whole rather than for monetary compensation.~~

Am I crazy to think this is how the world should be? 

EDIT: Perhaps eliminating currency would be more problematic than keeping it.</original_post>

    <text>The only......well the primary problem with this approach is who gets to decide what is best for society?  I can guarantee that i would disagree with you on some points at least.  Who decides who's opinion goes?  Democracy, that won't work, tyranny of the majority would quickly escalate.  What about great minds?  That won't work either because who decides who's mind is great?  Sooner or later, given your approach, it will be you that is eliminated for the common good.</text>
