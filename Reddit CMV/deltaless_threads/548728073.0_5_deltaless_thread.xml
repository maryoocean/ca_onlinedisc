    <title>CMV: There is no reasonable or practical way to actually enforce an abortion ban</title>
    <original_poster>captainporcupine3</original_poster>
    <original_post>My apologies if I'm hopelessly naive about U.S. law. A better title for this post might be, "I can't think of any reasonable or practical way to enforce an abortion ban, please enlighten me."

I often hear people arguing the merits of an abortion ban without grappling with the real and practical challenges of actually enforcing the ban. It seems to me that there are some pretty glaring issues that would arise if we tried to actually enforce a ban. I'm starting from the premise that we all agree that it's permissible to terminate a pregnancy if necessary to save the life of the mother. So here are some potential issues I am wondering about:

1) How does the state determine that you had an abortion in the first place? It's my understanding that the government can legally subpoena your medical records by obtaining a search warrant if necessary for a criminal investigation. But on what grounds could the state receive such a warrant in the first place? How would the state know that you as an individual were ever pregnant in the first place, let alone suspect that the pregnancy was terminated? I'm not aware of any registry of individual pregnant women that could be checked over. 

2) If the state did have some suspicion that a specific pregnancy was terminated, on what grounds would it suspect that the termination was unlawful? Particularly if abortion is lawful when necessary to save the life of the mother. Not to mention the fact that pregnancies are terminated when the fetus has died in the womb. Assuming the state had some mechanism for determining what pregnancies were terminated, would it be given carte blanche to review to the medical records of any individual who fell into that category in order to determine if each individual case was legal? Is it reasonable or practical for the state to launch an investigation into the private medical history of every woman whose pregnancy is lawfully terminated to root out the individuals whose pregnancies were terminated unlawfully? 

3) Assuming you granted the state those rights and were willing to support the bureaucracy necessary to enact them, what next? When reviewing individual medical histories, what criteria does the state use to determine that an individual termination was unlawful? Surely there are plenty of borderline decisions where the mother's life is at substantial and even imminent risk but she still has the right to continue the pregnancy if she chooses? What metric does the state use to determine that a specific pregnancy was risky enough that termination is deemed legal or illegal in that instance? Isn't it true that in many cases different doctors would reasonably disagree on the risk to the mother's life?

4) Once the state determines that a particular termination is deemed unlawful, how do you prosecute? Does the state pursue murder charges in a jury trial? Are the individual's private medical records made available to a jury so that they can make the ultimate ruling on whether the termination was indeed unlawful? And based on what -- the reasonable person metric? Can non experts make a reasonable determination on the merits of a medical diagnosis like the need to terminate a pregnancy?

Again, my apologies if some of these questions are naive. From my humble position these seem like reasonable questions, but if I am wrong that they are serious or noteworthy issues then please change my view.

    <text>As has been stated by others the main stratagey to enforce an abortibon ban would be to crack down on any medical professional that perform abortions. This is eaily done by stings and informers. Plus in most of the states that are most likely to ban abortion there are so few clincis that offer them already I doubt it would be difficult to ferret out any doctors or nurses that would break the law. That leaves the "back alley abortions" which of which we know from pre roe v. Wade history result in complications such as excessive bleeding with require emergency room visit. Any suspicious visit could be investigated and result on further proscutions. The actually just in Indiana in 2013. https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/indiana-has-now-charged-two-asian-american-women-feticide-n332761
But there would still be plenty of abortions. Wealthy people would be able to travel across state lines or internationally to place that allow abortions and it's highly unlikely that they will be caught. Effectivly a ban would only apply to the poor.</text>

    <text>Good information. Thanks. The interesting thing is that I'm not convinced it's possible to ensure that patients have access to medically necessary abortions, especially in borderline cases, if the state has the discretion and incentive to jail providers. </text>

    <text>That could be possible. But I believe an abortion is the same procedure that's sometimes required after a miscarriage. And as people will still miscarry one would hope the procedure would still be available.</text>

    <text>It wouldn't necessarily prevent abortions though, just abortions performed in the US. It doesn't stop anyone from border hopping</text>

    <text>It doesn't necessarily need to be wealthy people only though. Currently, poor elderly people take buses to Canada to get more affordable prescriptions</text>

    <text>I was speaking in generalities. Yes some poor people that have easy access to the boarders by coincidence of where they live would be less effected but overall the the ban would most likely effect poor people more much more than rich people.

    <text>I mean, even people in the south go to Canada for that reason. Megabus basically runs it's business around the idea</text>
