    <title>I believe that the 40-hour workweek is unnecessary on any level. CMV</title>

    <original_post>I believe that working 40 hours a week is entirely unnecessary for even (and perhaps especially for) technologically advanced first-world countries to thrive.  I feel that it isn't even possible for the majority of people to stay engaged for 8 or 9 hours a day, and that the 80/20 principle applies beautifully here (80 percent of work gets done during 20 percent of the time).

Our technological productivity has outpace our wants and needs to such a vast degree that it seems there are only to reasons justifying such a long work-week:

1-The economic machine needs people to be occupied so that they fall into the consumer mentality and fill up their few remaining hours with purchased items to entertain and fulfill themselves.  If people worked less, even if they were as productive, our economic growth would slow (which ecologically needs to happen, but I suppose can be seen as a negative).

2-Certain endeavors demand 40 hours or more a week.  Athletics, science, writing...but these are passion-based, rather than need-based.

I believe we could live happily in a world where everyone worked 20 hours each week.  CMV

edit: An awesome article that sums up my points much better than I can (thanks /u/WishingForBadThings)

    <text>There are jobs that are simply inneficient to be split up by more and more people. As an example, consider medicine. Work hour restrictions for residents were made more stringent. As a result, there were more hand offs of patient information. More mistakes were made due to missed events. It is simply not possible to do the work required to take care of patients in 20 hours in a week. My job as an anesthesiologist requires that I be in the hospital 40-50 hours a week, and on call more than that. Is it possible to hire three times as many anesthesiologists? maybe, but the supply of anesthesiologists simply isn't large enough.  
As another example, consider law. My sister works as a lawyer at a large firm. There simply aren't enough lawyers to go around for her to cut her work hours to 20 hours a week.  
While there are many jobs that could conceivably be done more efficiently, there are many professions where that simply is not possible, and where there are unintended consequences to changing the structure of work hours so dramatically.</text>
