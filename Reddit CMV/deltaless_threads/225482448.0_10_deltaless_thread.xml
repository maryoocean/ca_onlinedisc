    <title>CMV: Going to the gym is wasteful and selfish.</title>

    <original_post>Most people in developed countries, thanks to modern technology, are no longer required to exert themselves physically to earn a living, so they go the gym for various reasons to be able to exert themselves physically. I think that the people who do this would serve society far, far better by doing something constructive with this energy. For thousands of years (at the least) there has been a dearth of physical labor. This gave rise to slavery as a way to force people to do physical work, something most societies did for thousands of years, until very recently, which demonstrates just how incredibly valuable human physical labor is. So why are people squandering this invaluable resource doing completely trivial things? If every person who went to the gym every day volunteered doing something constructive with their energy, they would get the work out they want, but at the end of the day instead of lifting and lowering a piece of metal they would have helped build a house or helped a farmer harvest their crop. People are wasting their energy to accomplish literally nothing in the world, except for the changes that take place in your own body. If ending hunger and homelessness are more important to people than working out your muscle groups in the exact right order, then this should not be a problem. If the tens of millions of people who went to the gym used all of that energy to a constructive end instead of to literally no end, then we could probably fix many of the problems facing our society today.

    <text>I've thought about this a lot too, but the strangest thing about modern society is that it has turned conventional wisdom on it's head. Say a person operates a machine for 8 hours a day and lifts weights for 1 hour a day. They could build much more than if they were doing direct physical labor the entire time. The alternative is that people build things directly, but they would be losing time on a less efficient means of production. Plus you'd have to spend a lot of time and energy on logistics, transporting people to the build site, and training people to do work.

Modern society has created a world where it's much more energy efficient to allow a tiny number of farmers to farm many acres and ship their food across the country or even world, than to have local farmers grow things directly. In the same way, it's much more efficient to have everyone do their desk jobs, and then get a concentrated workout at a gym. You might work all your muscles slightly over the course of a day, but in an hour at the gym, you can push all your muscles to their limit. 

The same thing happens with regards to volunteer work. Volunteers are so inefficient that it's actually much cheaper to hire people to build a school or whatever than to get volunteers, especially in developing countries. The main reason why charities take on volunteers is that those volunteers are much more likely to donate money afterwards. If an investment banker or lawyer makes $100/hour at work, or does $8/hour worth of volunteer work, it makes much more sense to have them do their day job and donate the extra cash to charity.

People who weight lift are not generally people who have real physical jobs. They are much more efficient spending their time at their day jobs, and spending a little bit of time maintaining their bodies for the sake of their health.</text>
