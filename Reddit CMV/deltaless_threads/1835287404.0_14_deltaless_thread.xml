    <title>CMV: Twitter will be transformed into a right-wing hellscape</title>
    <original_poster>newleafsauce</original_poster>
    <original_post>I fear Twitter will become yet another fringe, conspiracy-fuelled and bigoted platform like all the sites that don't moderate for misinformation or hate speech. User enjoyability will plummet and the loudest and most active sect will be those who ordinarily would be banned under the pre-Musk terms &amp;amp; conditions. 

Musk has expressed his intentions today to transform Twitter into a site that allows all free speech under the law. What does this mean? This means white supremacists, incels, misogynists, conspiracy theorists, science denialists, and anti-LGBT zealots, among other far-right groups will be able to promote the most repugnant content and disinformation, and grow their respective movements, which will inevitably spill over into the real world. They will be allowed to brigade and hate on any Twitter user who belongs to the identities they despise. And their victims can't do anything meaningful about it except to spend hours blocking harrasing accounts / DMs or to leave the platform entirely.  

The toxicity will get so bad that the  most socially-progressive people and people with non-fringe views will likely leave. Twitter will skew heavily right-wing and far-right fast under Musk. 

If you can say anything to alleviate my fears and predictions, I would be open to hearing it so I can have my mind changed on this.</original_post>

    <text>So basically the exact opposite of what it is now?</text>

    <text>If by exact opposite you mean a diverse place with many opposing viewpoints, except where hate speech and misinformation is not allowed, then yes.</text>

    <text>Is that really how you see Reddit? I suppose Twitter doesn't favor liberalism either does it? CNN is a reliable news source right? The old guard.</text>

    <text>Twitter isn't as diverse as you think, twitter literally admitted to having a bias in algorithm for rightwing politicians and news outlets. There's plenty of examples where left leaning commentators have promoted hate speech and misinformation, but you don't seem to have a problem with that even though left wing extremism is on the rise</text>
