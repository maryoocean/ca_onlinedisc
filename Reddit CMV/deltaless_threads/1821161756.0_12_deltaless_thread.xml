    <title>CMV: It’s extremely stupid to ask celebrities to condemn their fans when they make threats to another celebrity (or other people, in general).</title>

    <original_post>Recently, I looked up Perez Hilton because I had no idea who he was and I kept hearing his name, and I was annoyed right off the bat. Looks like he tried to fling mud on Ariana Grande (alleging that she took coke at a party) which lead to nasty comments and threats by fans of her towards Hilton. After a while, she complied with his request and told her fans to chill out.

It drives me nuts that this sort of shit happens as though people that like a certain celebrity are dogs that can be called off of their attack when the center of their infatuation says they want it to end.

It insulates evasive pussy conduct like that of Hilton, and makes celebrities look like the bad guys if they refuse to call the fans off, making it look like the celebrity sicced the fans on them in the first place.

We’re left in this surreal area where celebrity targets are making efforts to protect their shit-talkers, which they should have no obligation to do. Grande sings songs, it’s not like she’s a mob boss.

But this is just a case study, there are probably thousands of examples similar to this.</original_post>

    <text>I don’t think it’s stupid, and it can get dangerous. 

When the columbine kids shot up a school, the media came after Marilyn Manson. Manson was incredibly well spoken and intelligent. His interview on the O’Reilly show really shows that and is a good watch if you’ve never seen it. 

While Manson had no obligation to disavow the attack, him putting out a statement was a morally good thing to do. If Manson’s fans thought this was “cool” for some reason and more shootings happened because of it, that would be problematic for society and Manson. 

Telling crazed fans to back off isn’t necessarily asking them to condemn their fan base, but silence can mean that it’s something they don’t disagree with or perhaps even silently approve of. 

The celebrity didn’t ask someone to harass Perez Hilton; however, due to the nature of how this just works, by remaining silent and not making a statement, they are making a statement (if they are made aware of the behavior). 

I hope that makes sense.</text>
