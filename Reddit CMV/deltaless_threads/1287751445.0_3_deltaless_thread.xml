    <title>CMV: American right wingers should support Russia/China/Iran against their own country.</title>
    <original_poster>Ion_12</original_poster>
    <original_post>I should start off by saying, I don’t really lump libertarians or NeoConservatives into the “right wing”.

When it comes to social “degeneracy” (LGBT rights, interracial relationship legality, feminism, etc), America is light years ahead of the rest of the world. Even America’s “right” party voted in support of these things. But, in countries like Russia, China, and Iran, these things are either illegal, or heavily frowned upon. 

The way America is set up, it is essentially impossible to turn the country into a right wing authoritarian state. If one wants something like that, they should support the other world powers to weaken America on the world stage, or support them to overthrow the American government, and promise full support if those countries are willing to put them in power.

It makes no sense for American “nationalists” to support their country at all.</original_post>

    <text>This country already is a right wing authoritarian state. The Democratic Party has established a permanent military occupation of the capital and is talking about purging the (even further right-wing!) Republican party from the Congress. Citizens have no rights to be free of surveillance or brutality and no method to hold the security state accountable. Oh! And also the President claims the authority to murder anyone on the planet with a sky robot with no oversight.</text>
