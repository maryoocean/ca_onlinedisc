    <title>CMV: Life is meaningless, and there's no point to trying to prolong it as much as possible.</title>

    <original_post>Whatever we do, ultimately, has no meaning. In the grand scheme of things, we are but a tiny speck of dust on a meaningless planet.

That's why i say that trying to prolong life is absolutely useless. This includes tries to reanimate dying people, trying to find a special formula for immortality, and similar medical/engineering advances.

Instead of finding ways to prolong life, we could better spend resources to make the life we've got more pleasurable. This would be a much better way to spend our time and resources, by actively trying to become a better and happier society, where death is just part of the cycle, with no taboos attached to it.</original_post>

    <text>You seem to value pleasure, as you regard increasing it a worthwhile aim. Increasing someone's lifespan increases the total amount of pleasure they experience, a good thing. Why do you not consider this a good thing?</text>
