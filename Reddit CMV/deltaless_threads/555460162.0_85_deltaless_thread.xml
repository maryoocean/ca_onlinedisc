    <title>CMV: Most people are not well read enough to reasonably advocate for political or economic change</title>
    <original_poster>I_am_Norwegian</original_poster>
    <original_post>**Edit: "Well read" was a poor choice of words. I think "have done their due diligence" might be more accurate.**

I'm writing this because I want to be proven wrong, because people saying political things, especially as if obvious has started to annoy and anger me more. Especially if they're making fun of someone for their political views, even if I disagree with those views. I hate feeling angry, so hopefully writing my thoughts out will help.

In trying to figure out my own political views, I've come to realize that I can't reasonably hold the views I held, or any other views. I studied economics, mainly the school of thought that appealed to me. But then more and more I came to realize that I couldn't say if the Keynesian or post-keynesian or the Chicago school or MMT etc. were correct, and that even people who devote their lives to the study of economics struggle with the same thing. The same thing happened in philosophy, especially as I came to realize the importance of epistemology and ontology.

And you can't reasonably expect people to put in the effort and time that it takes to sort through these fields. And that there is still such debate among the experts that even if you become and expert, the truth will not be obvious. I've come to understand what Socrates meant when he said something like "I only know that I know nothing".

I've also come to believe that people hold the beliefs they do more for social reasons. Less for the truth of the beliefs, but more because their reaffirm their identity, and their social bonds.

I can't blame them for that, or for not spending thousands of hours sorting through political thought, philosophy and economics. But a part of me still believes that they haven't done their due diligence, and I get angry that they can affirm themselves and their beliefs, while I sit here uncertain, unable to succinctly articulate why, or how to get this across properly.</original_post>

    <text>Most people have a need to fit in that overrides all other aspects of life, we are, after all social creatures; copying the beliefs of those in your immediate family and community fosters instant friendships. 


More important further are those opinions and stances heard first, that is those heard in early childhood, as most people believe the first thing they hear on a topic, this is called the "halo effect" in that regardless of additional data, the information learned first is grossly overweighted.


*-"The tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person [or event/idea] - is known as the halo effect. The term has been in use in psychology for a century, but it has not come into wide use in everyday language. This is a pity, because the halo effect is a good name for a common bias that plays a large role in shaping our view of people and situations." 


*-Thinking, Fast and Slow - by Daniel Khaneman pg 82 - A Machine For Jumping To Conclusions


Most people don't know and don't want to know the "truth", their brains have simply made it trivial to assert their first impressions and made a lot of cognitive ease in defending those beliefs whether based on truth or not


Tl;dr: the truth or efficacy of some policy/idea is unimportant when it comes to creating and asserting one's opinion, most people's opinions are simply copy/pastes of their first impressions/upbringing due to the "halo effect"
