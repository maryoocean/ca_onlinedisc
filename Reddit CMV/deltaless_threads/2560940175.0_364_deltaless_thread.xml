    <title>cmv: There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as an “American”</title>

    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>It's not too hard, you're north-american or yanquee. "American" include the entire contintent so wouldn't be so accurate. I don't mind the empire thing, just the fact we're very different (I'm from Argentina) and like I'm american but nothing to do in cultural terms with the US, so I think it's like making the rest invisible by saying that you're America when we have tons of countries that have nothing to do with the US in America.</text>
