    <title>CMV: Local suburban detective police are pointless</title>
    <original_poster>jeffunity</original_poster>
    <original_post>I will admit i live in a low crime area of a low crime nation. However I recently interacted with the police on several occasions and each time left feeling like our tax dollars are wasted. Please note i am not talking about having detectives on call for a wide area (I would suggest one or two teams in my city of 3 million people spread widely), i admit that *some* detectives will always be necessary for murders and the like. Nor am i talking about traffic police/highway patrol, or general law and order uniformed police. These are all necessary as part of a normal society. But normal robberies seem to be a fact of life and are never solved, nor are any goods recovered.

In the past 3 months i have had the following occur:

\- I rented a forklift to a customer. I have previously rented to this customer, we require all renters to carry insurance for the forklift. The forklift was stolen because the customer didn't secure the site well. the police response was "check ebay and auction sites, you know forklifts better than i do." After 2 weeks he asked if i had found it, then said there wasn't anything else he could do.

\- the business next to me was robbed. The police asked for my security footage. I went through it, couldn't see anything and told them that. They didn't have any further follow ups after that.

\- My employers car was stolen. using local contacts he managed to get the names of some people who might be involved. he also tracked the use of a credit card from the car and located a shopping centre they were buying products in. The police refused to follow up on those leads provided.

I am not commenting on police brutality or discrimination. But I feel these police detectives that are dealing with local crime are not doing their job, or their job is no longer possible.</original_post>

    <text>Do you understand why the police detectives have interacted with you in the way they have? 

They have no leads on the forklift theft because there was probably no security footage at the customer site. They *should* tell you that there was no footage. EBay or some other marketplace would be the most likely place for a stolen item, and forklifts are somewhat uncommon, so a forklift on a site like that would raise some suspicion.

When the business next door was robbed, they were only looking for security footage and not having any did not warrant a further follow up.

The stolen car is actually concerning because of the level of detail your employer is able to give (in addition to the fact that it's a higher level of theft plus credit card fraud). When you say the police refused to follow up on leads, what do you mean? Did they state that outright or is that your employer's opinion?</text>
