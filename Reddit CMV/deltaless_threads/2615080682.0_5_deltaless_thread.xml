    <title>CMV: Taylor Swift is the best artist of the 21st century and is on track to become the best artist of all time.</title>
    <original_poster>DesperateForYourDick</original_poster>
    <original_post>Note that here, “best” means most popular, most successful, most famous, etc. I am in no way saying that her music is the objective best music to listen to or anything like that.

Taylor Swift is a cultural phenomenon. Yes, her music is stereotypical “basic white girl music” (which is a problematic belief that many hold that I won’t get into here), but way too many people deny that she’s an all-time great just to be controversial, quirky, different, etc.

[Here is a quick list of her awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Taylor_Swift)

In addition to those, she has been on top of Billboard Artist 100 for **81 weeks**. She is the only artist to take up **every single spot** on the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time. She has multiple songs (Love Story, You Belong With Me, Shake it Off, We Are Never Getting Back Together) that have stood the test of time for a decade and will likely be classics at least on the level of songs like Hey Jude, or even We Will Rock You.

Furthermore, the Eras Tour is arguably already the most famous concert tour ever. Going by current numbers it will absolutely demolish the record for highest grossing concert tour, which was set by Elton John’s Farewell Yellow Brick Road. And it’ll do so with just 1/3 the number of concerts.

Just look at the NFL. Their Twitter account changed their profile picture, bio, and banner just because Taylor Swift showed up to a Chiefs game. To have that level of influence over the most popular sports league in the United States is insane.

Yes, I’m a big fan of her work. But even objectively speaking, I don’t see how anyone can deny that, when she does retire, she will be one of the greatest artists to ever live, just in terms of objective popularity.

And just to directly address the claims made in my title—I for one cannot name any artist with more name recognition in the 20th century. “Taylor Swift” is, at this point, used as the default name-drop for “stereotypically popular singer”. And her current level of popularity/fame is on par with any great artist (say, for example, the Beatles or Michael Jackson) at their peak, which is why I think she has a shot at becoming #1 all time.</original_post>

    <text>I don't really understand why you keep using the term "best" when you specifically state that by that, you mean highest grossing or most successful.

Obviously music is subjective, so best in any other context wouldn't make sense. And her success is easily measured against other artists.

I guess I don't understand what view you want changed?</text>

    <text>As stated, by “best” I mean “most successful, most popular, most famous, etc”. I just don’t want to type that out every time.

I guess I only posted because most of my friends call me delusional for thinking this. This sub is for discovering arguments against your beliefs, which I’m looking to do here.</text>

    <text>Perhaps you should stop saying she's the best artist? Say she's the most successful at the record business.</text>

    <text>If your argument is purely sales and accolades aren’t those all public record? Like aren’t you arguing objective stuff that can just be googled?</text>

    <text>i think you have really good arguments, where "really good" is instead defined as "dumb and a waste of everyone's time"</text>

Maybe you should edit your post then? Because we will keep getting these comments rightfully calling you out on a bad argument. I’m also confused, because you concede but also argue against that fact, by trying to justify that what you consider to be the definition of “best” to be when no one agrees with you</text>

    <text>that word is 'successful'. is she one of the most successful artists of all time? maybe, but nowhere near the top few hundreds. and certainly not even close to the top several thousands of 'best' artists.</text>

    <text>I love Taylor, but imo your argument doesn’t hold up simply because you can’t predict the future. The world is becoming more and more globalized and we may very well have technology that revolutionizes music in a way we can’t imagine. You can’t say someone *will* be the best of all time.</text>
