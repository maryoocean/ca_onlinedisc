    <title>CMV: Legislative bodies should be required to explain, in formal writing, why they voted a certain way when it comes to legislation.</title>

    <original_post>I think publicly elected officials responsible for driving policy and legislation should be required to explain why they vote certain ways in writing. Voting along party lines is reprehensible regardless of the side. Politics shouldn't be a game about which side wins, but rather which fact-based opinions win regardless of sides. If the legislative bodies have no reasonable explanation for why they voted a certain way besides voting along party lines, they should not be allowed to vote because we have no reason to believe that they're not voting out of self-interest. If, for example, someone in Congress voted against what seems to be reasonable gun law without explanation, but you can see in their financial disclosure that the NRA contributes a lot of money and support for them, how are we to know that their vote was not influenced by the NRA without them explicitly citing so and explaining what other reason compelled them not to vote for said reasonable legislation? I'm not even asking for a long written response from them. A short paragraph or page summary with sources they're using to base their vote on is good enough. </original_post>

    <text>The 109th Tennessee General Assembly adjourned on April 22nd, 2016 to become a part of Tennessee history with passage of major legislation to reduce crime, cut tax burdens, spur job growth, accelerate the stateâ€™s success in K-12 education, boost the number of college graduates, curb drug abuse and curtail drunk driving.

State lawmakers also passed significant legislation to ease traffic congestion, reduce child abuse, aid farmers, increase access to healthcare and medication, increase voter participation and provide a safer environment for the elderly.</text>
