    <title>CMV: The fact there are certain weapons that I as a private citizen can't own is inconsistent logic of the use of the Second Amendment.</title>
    <original_poster>quixoticromantic</original_poster>
    <original_post>The second amendment: A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

Arms: Weapons and ammunition; armaments

As you can see, the second amendment doesn't define what arms really mean, so I also provided Oxford dictionary's definition of arms. 

As a private citizen, there are certain weapons and ammunition that I can't own. To me this suggests that there is a certain definition of what constitutes arms and it's up to our current society and current legislature to define what that means. With the logic I am using, this means that guns aren't inherently arms or fall within the second amendment. It would not be unconstitutional to outlaw guns if society decides to do so. Guns aren't inherently protected under the second amendment in other words. It is only this current society and legislature that does include it.

So basically to sum up my argument and, at least to me, keep the logic consistent, I should be able to own any and all weapons available or guns aren't inherently part of the Second amendment.

Change my view!

Edit: Two redditors have succesfully convinced me that the second amendment does limit the owning of certain weapons. However this doesn't mean that my other view point has changed. Guns aren't inherently part of the Second amendment, and the outlawing of guns could still be possible without getting rid of the Second amendment

Second Edit: to clarify how to now change my view, you have to convince me that the limitations that aleady exist in the second amendment can't somehow be extended to any and all guns.</original_post>

    <text>The argument that you want to make here is that the only arms that need be permitted are those that are necessary to the security of the free state.

Presumably this can be something debated by society? What level of armament is necessary to preserve the free nature of the state? Which enemies must we protect against? Foreign invaders? How about the state itself?

Regardless of what kind of society we'd like to live in, it is hard to argue that defense against those forces would be very effective without guns. Of course, tanks may also be necessary. And anti-aircraft guns as well.</text>

    <text>We currently live in the most peaceful time in human history. As a country, we are surrounded by two oceans and two friendly countries. We have the largest standing navy in the world. Is it to far fetch to say that citizens will be safe without the private ownership of guns?</text>

    <text>To that point, we have the largest standing Navy, the most powerful and technologicalally advanced army, and incredibly over powered air force, as well as the CIA ,FBI, NSA, and so on. How in the hell are you going to tell me that citizens are safe without the private ownership of guns. And are we really safe even with guns. 

I also don't want you to think that I think those organizations are abusing powers or will at any point in my lifetime. But the second amendment was unquestionably written with the purpose of revolution in kind.</text>

    <text>So now I'll go in the opposite direction. With all these armies, how are we safe with only pistols and hunting rifles? How are we to fight naval warships and drones with those? Are you suggesting we need to match their firepower?</text>

    <text>Is say we aren't really. But guns do give us the best reasonable chance of fighting back. 

Until we started dealing with ISIS. Most of the groups we were fighting were armed basically with small arms + RPGs. Look at how effective our ridiculously OPed military has been at stomping them out. I believe that a major reason for this is that the combatants are mixed with non-combatants, and we are unwilling to just go in an bomb the hell out of both groups. Which I think is right. 

If a revolution attempt were to be made in the US it would not be the south rising up like in the civil war which allowed for total war along a clear border. It would much more likely be some rebels in some cities/regions in some states. The military would have a target acquisition problem because the rebels look just like the citizens. This gives the rebels a comparative advantage because their targets would likely be government/military buildings. The military still has an absolute advantage, don't  get me wrong, but there have been many instances where a comparative advantage has defeated an absolute advantage. Basically any successful revolution. </text>
