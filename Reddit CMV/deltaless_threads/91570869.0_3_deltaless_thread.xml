    <title>CMV: Why isn't Wonder Woman sexist?</title>
    <original_poster>BottomOfTheNinth</original_poster>
    <original_post>Most of what I hear and see about Wonder Woman leads me to believe she's sexist. In the depictions I've seen of her she comes from a society that banished men, she seems to be surprised when men are good (and on the opposite side of things, surprised when women are evil) and generally can't go five minutes without calling men dicks because her dad was an asshole.

To clarify, this isn't some men's rights post. I don't care on some kind of personal level if she is or isn't sexist, I just kind of want it clarified for me because a lot of people say she isn't sexist - yet in the examples I've seen of her (the Justice League cartoon, the animated Wonder Woman film, the Flashpoint comic book series...) she pretty much just hates men in general. A lot of people have also told me that while Wonder Woman herself isn't sexist, the Amazons are, so I could kind of do with that being explained too.</original_post>

    <text>Isms are complicated. 

Sexism isn't a straight-forward, black and white issue. It is about patterns of behavior more than it is about instances (though instances can be blatant). 

When Wonder Woman was created, she was part of a different era in which she was *perceived* as a strong feminist symbol. Superheros were predominately male and because she was female (with kick-ass powers) she is seen as breaking a pattern and thus becomes a symbol of female empowerment. 

But we're now past that kind of thinking. The whole sexy outfit and the Amazonian background story will strike some modern audiences as highly sexist. 

**So which is it**? 

It is what you want it to be. If you want to look at her as a stepping stone towards redefining images of female power then she is not a sexist figure. She's a figure of progress even if that progress was en media res when it happened. If you want to take a modern perspective you will see her as clich√© and off the point. At a certain point, there is no pulling apart that nostalgia from a modern eye because you can never really appreciate her reception for the time (nor can I) because you can't divorce yourself from the moment in history you occupy. So we're all stuck negotiating how to read her.

    <text>I seem to remember reading somewhere that Wonder Woman was initially conceived as some kind of dominatrix fetish superhero. If memory serves me right, around the same time there were a lot of non-official comic books popping up about females dominating male superheroes - the most popular among these being Lois Lane dominating Superman. DC Comics had profited on this to some degree (I think there's quite a famous issue of Superman where Lois Lane has him tied up on the front cover) but decided to go the whole nine yards and just create a dominatrix superhero. That kind of supports your idea that what she was conceived as and what she is now are two completely separate characters.</text>

    <text>Wonder Woman was conceived and introduced in early 1940's. I don't know any comics of some sort female supremacy/misandry/dominatrix themes especially in the 1940s, let alone it being a "popular" theme. 

There was a big bondage theme going on that was later dropped, but it doesn't seem to be gendered/sexist or dominating males to me. If anything you see Wonder Woman being chained a lot just as much as her restraining her enemies.  

Here's some interesting history on them

Anyways, a character as big as Wonder Woman is not a single entity as dozens of writers have written her in many variations. If you want to make the claim that she's sexist, you should at least find specific examples, but if you do scrutinize characters like this, there's probably way more examples of her a sexist representation against women. </text>

    <text>By dominatrix stuff, I did actually mean bondage. I should have been clearer about that. I don't know of many examples of women being bound and tied, but Superman specifically had a lot of covers dealing with him being tied up: http://io9.com/5972297/superman-in-bondage-the-kinkiest-kryptonian-comics-covers-ever-published

I can't find the original blog I remember reading in relation to the bondage stuff being popular in relation to men, but I can do one better. The co-creator of Superman, Joe Shuster, made a lot of money writing bondage comic books before Superman became popular: http://www.trendhunter.com/trends/naughty-superman

The "themes" section of Wonder Woman's creator also has a lot to say about it being popular at the time, but again, nothing in relation to men: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Moulton_Marston#Themes</text>
