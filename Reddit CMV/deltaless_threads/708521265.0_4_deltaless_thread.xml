    <title>CMV: Chromium should be the reference web browser implementation and maintained by an independent, non-profit organization.</title>
    <original_poster>vincentofearth</original_poster>
    <original_post>Warning: this is a bit technical and long-winded and you may not actually care.

&amp;lt;background&amp;gt;

The [web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) is built on a set of [standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_standards) that determine how web sites &amp;amp; apps are created, how they should be displayed, and how they should behave. Several organizations maintain and create these standards, like the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/), [Ecma International](https://www.ecma-international.org/default.htm), and many more (mostly with terrible websites).

The basic idea is that through these standards bodies, companies (Google, Microsoft, Apple), non-profits (Mozilla), and other internet stakeholders can come together and agree on some rules, recommendations, and conventions. Developers follow these standards when creating apps and websites. In turn, browsers agree to honor the standards. This is how you can create an app once and know that it's the same on all the latest browsers.

Except that last statement **isn't true**. Even a casual person on the web will know that [certain sites](https://twitter.com/AirbnbHelp/status/752829250198245376) just look weird on certain browsers. Weird bugs will pop up or some apps just don't work on browsers with a smaller market share. Some websites will even block specific browsers.

A lot of websites today are [built only for Chrome](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards), and Firefox/Edge/Safari users can count themselves lucky if, by sheer luck, a website also works on their obscure browser. Google Chrome's [dominance](http://gs.statcounter.com/) (63% market share) and [other](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/about) [factors](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdge/blob/master/README.md) mean that this will probably only grow worse in the future. Many [feel that this threatens](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/12/06/goodbye-edge/) the open standards that the web is built on, as Google builds its own set of standards and becomes the ultimate gatekeeper to our online lives.

Standards can never cover all the bases. Each [browser engine](https://gizmodo.com/which-browser-engine-powers-your-web-browsing-and-why-d-1833935288) implements standards [differently](https://caniuse.com/), with just enough minor differences to matter. They don't always do it at the same pace, their users don't update at the same pace, and they sometimes add features that aren't even standard yet. So developers are left to adapt--to patch the gaps and create workarounds, or (as more and more are doing) just give up and assume their users are using Chromium (Chrome's engine) or block those that aren't.

&amp;lt;/background&amp;gt;

Many feel that the solution is for more browsers--or actually, more browser *engines*, with a healthier market share for each (basically, *more competition*). This will force developers to build for the whole internet, not just for Chrome. I think this is a pipe dream at this point.

My position: there should be a **reference implementation** of a web browser that is actively maintained by a single independent, non-profit organization with members from many different stakeholders. Developers should test their sites on this reference. Actual browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) can add their own specific app features like a Download Manager, Extensions, Reading mode--anything that's not rendering the page. They can even deviate from the reference, but they must do so knowing that the reference stays the reference.

As things currently stand, the standards leave too much for browser vendors to decide. There are entire libraries devoted to solving the issue of incompatibility between browsers, and they haven't succeeded. This should not be the case. Competition is good, but it should be based on merit, not on how entrenched something is. As a user, I want to choose my browser based on its **features**, and I should just be able to assume that it can do the basic job of rendering a web page correctly, and (perhaps more important) consistently.

Edit: Added a final section I left out earlier, plus some additional clarification.</original_post>

    <text>Even non-profits need some source(s) of funding because people need a living.

Whatever nonprofit would take on this responsibility would have to do *a lot* of other things too. Entities that throw their money at this org typically have some level of power... at which point, can we really say that this nonprofit is independent? It's unlikely that such a nonprofit would last very long on random user donations. (Though Wikipedia resorts to user donations infrequently, fact of the matter remains that it must resort to them.)

Realistically such a nonprofit could be threatened by its funders, unless it has such a wide array of funders that such a threat has no real consequence (especially if this nonprofit saves money for the future, for uncertain times).

What guarantee is there anyway that a nonprofit is able to produce a better standard, or one that actually manages to garner support, let alone both?</text>

    <text>But the current standards organizations are already controlled by members that include private companies. Just take a look at the [list of W3C members](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List). It will be as independent as the current standard bodies. Which, I guess, is to say "not at all", but by virtue of being controlled by so many stakeholders it will be unlikely for one company/entity to dominate the standards process.

This can really only work this way, I think. There will never be a decree from God about which standards to follow, so standards can only emerge when all the right players come together despite their differences and agree on something.</text>

    <text>&amp;gt; It will be as independent as the current standard bodies. 

I presumed that when you included "independent" in the title, it was as opposed to the idea you express with this sentence (including "less independent" bodies). Am I wrong? I thought you wanted something more.

Even beyond that, "by virtue of being controlled by so many stakeholders it will be unlikely for one company/entity to dominate the standards process"... surely you can see that it happens easily enough that sides are built up no matter what? Does this oppose your idea of independence or is this entirely depend on what demands are laid out? In case of the latter, how could you hope to distinguish independent interests from private ones? How do you even identify whatever is supposed to come from independents specifically?

From your OP:

&amp;gt; Competition is good, but it should be based on merit, not on how entrenched something is. 

When someone makes a sufficiently good product it may easily drown the competition and establish itself firmly --- for good reason. I'm not sure Chrome really is entrenched rather than actually having that merit you speak of, because as you say:

&amp;gt; There will never be a decree from God about which standards to follow

And who is to say that some compromise is the best anyway, when it is all subjective still? At some point we'll just have to settle for what is available. *Is it really worth the effort for whatever more there is to gain?*</text>
