    <title>CMV: I think Mike Tyson is insanely over rated, and over hyped. And is not even a top 10 fighter of all time.</title>
    <original_poster>YesIamaWizard</original_poster>
    <original_post>Ring magazine has Tyson ranked 72 of the last 80 years. There are much more amazing fighters that have come and gone, and I think specifically the most damning part to Tyson's mystique is that he fought a bunch of tomato cans and didn't fight anyone of real quality during his prime.

When Tyson did fight quality opponents he lost or had his ass handed to him by Lewis and Holyfield.
A huge portion of the mystique is Mike Tyson's punch out. Many people who know fighting know Tyson was over rated. But a vast majority don't know, and only know how "great" he was because of his video game.

I think currently there are a couple active fighters that are better pound for pound guys. And I think Lennox Lewis was even a better champ than Tyson with a far better skill set.

So convince me that Tyson is the greatest ever, and not Ali,Frazier,Foreman,Louis, or Robinson. I could continue on with the list. I really think Tyson is over hyped, and was more of a sideshow with mental and personal problems than great fighter.</original_post>

    <text>Tyson never fought any real competition. So naturally, a highlight reel is going to look really good, him knocking out bums like they're tomato cans. This is why people think Tyson is the GOAT. However, anyone can look great against unskilled opponents. The fact that anyone else *thinks* he would stand a chance against Ali is absolutely absurd.</text>
