    <title>CMV: Municipalities should not hold easily politicized elections for apolitical positions like sheriff.</title>

    <original_post>I see a lot about sheriffs being appointed through local elections, even seeing people wearing tshirts that say "Re-elect [sheriff's name] for [county name] county sheriff". But to me that seems to politicize a position that is one of considerable power to enforce the law in the area. By politicizing that, a sheriff is able to impose a political agenda to the point where it is literally able to be enforced at gunpoint, and can appoint deputies that align with them. While it makes towns essentially an absolute in terms of political alignment, it also insulates them to changes going on around them, including in surrounding towns or cities, and ultimately stifles progress and lets them get away with things that regular public officials wouldn't get away with because they are essentially their own oversight committee, like we saw with Joe Arpaio.</original_post>

    <text>It isn't politicizing the police, because the police are inherently political to begin with; they're the people who will come kick down your door if you offend other people's notions too much, after all.

What it does is give some level of control and accountability to the populace.

Sheriffs and police come from somewhere.  There has to be some mechanism for choosing them and empowering them.  If you eschew direct election, then you're essentially saying that other officials, elected or unelected, make the selection.  A truly staggering number of abuses lie in this direction.  You're giving existing politicians the right to buttress their power with hand-picked, completely insulated police, and there is no mechanism whatsoever for removing one that offends the community besides removing the politicians who support them.  If that politician is not local, but statewide or nationwide, then your attempt to change the system is pretty much doomed.

The police are a conservative institution, and they should be.  You really don't want the police suddenly changing their minds about what laws to enforce and what ones to leave alone.  A certain amount of predictability there is essential for civic function, not just for you, but for everyone.  The police should change slowly, and at the local level, and local police should always be primarily beholden to the city that they inhabit.  The people who are being policed should be the ones with the loudest voice in how that policing is done, and there's no better way to achieve that than free, open, local elections.</text>
