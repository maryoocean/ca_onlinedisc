    <title>CMV: Customer service sucks</title>
    <original_poster>comeandgetsome30</original_poster>
    <original_post>I know this is a broad generalization, but holy hell, I remember a time when I'd walk up to a counter and not be met with someone who would just stare at me until I initiated interaction. I know life sucks, but geeze, try just a smidge to be kind to those who aren't actively f*cking you. The problem seems to be ubiquitous, whether on the phone or in person. People seem disenfranchised, and with good reason, however this negative attitude just spreads like a contagious bug. 

I know this is subjective. For those who are old enough to compare times, I wonder if there isn't anyone who doesn't share this opinion. For those who aren't, I feel pity if this is your normal.</original_post>

    <text>Question 1: Do you work in customer service? 

If not, then you don't understand what it is like to be on the other end of the counter. 

I am betting that back when you remember customer service being nicer, the customers were probably also nicer. 

I worked in retail for 1 year at a hardware store, and 1.5 years at a petrol station. The cruelest customers were ironically the older people who would have "remembered" the days of nicer customer service.    

The customers are what makes customer service people not as helpful. I bet if you are nicer to them, they will be nicer to you.  (9 time out of 10) The final 1 time out 10 is the customer service representative is being a jerk.</text>
