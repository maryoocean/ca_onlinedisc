    <title>CMV: I think masturbation is bad for you.</title>
    <original_poster>TextingWhileDriving</original_poster>
    <original_post>I used to be part of the /r/NoFap community and felt good about it. I had a sense of pride when a day passed without masturbation squeezed in there. However, I never went longer than 2 weeks without masturbating. Each time I masturbated I felt a sense of dread and depression, knowing I would just masturbate again sometime later. 

Today I broke my 4 day streak. I feel depressed and stressed. This basically confirms how I felt about masturbation in the beginning. It's bad for you. You could change my view with study's or from experience yourself. Go ahead and try changing my view. </original_post>

    <text>A lot of people, including myself, don't feel bad when they, or just after they, masturbate. I think it would be more accurate to say, "I feel bad when I masturbate." It's your choice how you feel about masturbation and it's your choice to do it. There isn't really anything to debate here. </text>

    <text>He said downvote?  I'm going to have to see a citation for that.
