    <title>CMV: Public transportation should run 24/7.</title>
    <original_poster>Keep-reefer-illegal</original_poster>
    <original_post>We live in a world that is no longer 9-5. Businesses stay open later, friends can reach us with a portable device simply by typing on a mini keyboard. It doesn't make sense that public transportation isn't 24/7. Here are some reasons why it should be 24/7:

1. Very few buses run at 2 am for last call, I feel like if nothing else, running buses later let's responsible drunk people take public transit instead of driving home. 

2. It would benefit the working poor who may work night shift 

3. As mentioned before our world is now 24/7 

Those are my arguments. 

I encourage you all to change my view 

Edit: by transit I am including trains, buses, all forms of public transportation, not just buses.

    <text>Hey something I know about!  
I don't disagree with you per se; I think public transit *should* be 247.  But as many others said - funding is a big problem here.  But not necessarily whether or not the fixed route is solvent as many are talking about.  

According to the ADA, a public transit line must offer demand response service (door to door service) for all hours that their fixed route service is operating.

As you can imagine, the cost of demand response service is more expensive than fixed route (per ride) by orders of magnitude.

This probably isn't a huge issue in dense areas like NYC.  But in smaller cities of populations less than, say 300K, it's a huge roadblock.  

In order for a public transit line's fixed route service to stay open 247 in Des Moines IA for example, they would also need to offer door to door service for those who need it.  That means keeping more expensive drivers and smaller capacity buses on call and ready to go in the even that an eligible person needed a ride.

This is very expensive.  Should we invest in it?  Sure.  It's actually a big problem when a person is discharged from the hospital late at night and has no ride.  They're kind of screwed.  They usually can't do a cab since it you have to be able to get yourself into a cab for them to take you.  They typically pay out the ass for a private service.  And when you have a debilitating disability that prevents from being able to not only drive, buteven getting into an automobile, you're usually not rolling in money.

Anyway, to address your concern, this is usually why public transit doesn't expand its hours of service.  Because they're expanding not just the fixed route but also the much more costly demand response.

A private company doesn't have to follow this rule - since they don't necessarily have to serve the entire public.  That's how you end up with drunk buses and stuff around college campuses.  Those buses are usually funded differently.</text>
