    <title>CMV: Countries like Canada and the UK have a more illogical system of units then the US</title>
    <original_poster>Tommyblockhead20</original_poster>
    <original_post>Foreigners and even many Americans like to criticize or make fun of the United States for being one of the few countries to not adopt the metric system de facto, and talk about how illogical their system is. However I see little to no criticism aimed at countries like Canada or the UK that I find to have much more illogical systems of units. 

These countries use a mix of both metric and imperial. While the US may learn a worse system then metric, at least it is consistent in its usage (yes there are a number of specific areas metric is used but a vast majority of Americans don’t know the metric system because they don’t need to). But in Canada and the UK, they have to learn 2 completely different systems and switch between the two based on the context and usage. [There’s this popular post](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/e1hx4f/how_to_choose_measuring_units_in_canada/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=mweb) on r/coolguides about all the different times when metric or imperial is used, this is the only time I have really seen either of these countries be made fun of.

Now I’m not surprised and I don’t blame the citizens, it is inevitable old systems stick around when they are so ingrained in a culture. But I think that’s one of the reasons it’s best the US doesn’t try to switch systems, we’ve already seen what will happen, but that’s a whole nother discussion.

Is having 2 systems not more illogical then 1? Why does the US receive the most criticism for its system of units?</original_post>

    <text>I don't think 2 systems is the right wording. Because if so: we have multiple number system that are way more arbitrary. For my social circle it is common to talk about 2 dozen instead of 24. It's just our head using, what fits best in the situation, while an universal industry measurement helps global trade. The European buying 15 pounds and 3 ounces from China has much more problems than the one buying 8kg</text>

    <text>Ya I initially thought about changed it to sets of measures but I decided against going back and changing it. I think people understand what I mean though. Like ya, other words for exist, but they are mostly one-offs, not entire systems of measurements. Also I don’t think dozen is the best example, that’s not a unit of measurement, it’s just another number.  You can say a dozen meters, a dozen feet, a dozen grams, etc. I liked another example I saw of a car length. But that’s clearly not an entire set/system of measures.</text>
