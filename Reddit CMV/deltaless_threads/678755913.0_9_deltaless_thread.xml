    <title>CMV: Immigration is a good thing</title>
    <original_poster>dabbin_z</original_poster>
    <original_post>I think we run into more problems trying to keep our borders closed than we do open.  Diversity in population is a good thing and it’s what drives innovation.  I think what keeps us from progressing is bigotry and hatred towards other cultures. 

Think about how fast and easy it is for people to travel in the world.  We should encourage people to move around and explore new places not segregate communities.  There’s nothing worse in my opinion than trying to keep cultures the same.  

Western civilization has always been about immigration and new settlers.  With our civil right and strong economy, it’s no secret to why people want to leave their countries and come to America.  

I guess we already have open borders so thats not really my argument.  My opinion is rather that immigration is good for everyone and we should encourage it. </original_post>

Like higher wages, lower crime, better social cohesion, smaller welfare state, better health, Higher IQ?

&amp;gt;  Diversity in population is a good thing and it’s what drives innovation.

USA FBI statistics says you pulled that from your bum. Innovation is a Caucasoid characteristic.

&amp;gt; Think about how fast and easy it is for people to travel in the world. We should encourage people to move around and explore new places not segregate communities. 

If you want to go to South America or Africa to experience the culture, be my guest. I don't want them in America as they're inferior. The IQ is representative of their culture. All that happens with diversity is that you pull down the superior to accommodate the inferior. 

&amp;gt; Western civilization has always been about immigration and new settlers. With our civil right and strong economy, it’s no secret to why people want to leave their countries and come to America. 

Western civilization encourages the immigration of other westerners, not the third world. The third world is incompatible. 

&amp;gt; I guess we already have open borders so thats not really my argument. My opinion is rather that immigration is good for everyone and we should encourage it. 

Except that you are 180 degrees wrong. Heavily regulated immigration is beneficial. I want immigration to be such a pain in the ass, that only people that really want to immigrate come through.
