    <title>CMV: The recent Atlantic shootings was not an anti-Asian event.</title>
    <original_poster>MacV_writes</original_poster>
    <original_post>A white man shot six Asian women along with two others in Atlanta. The narrative that has been that this is directly caused by anti-Asian sentiment driven by racist white supremacists stoking bigotry against Asians. To solve this problem, America must truly commit to not being racist, to listen to those in the Asian community, and to teach young white men in particular the privilege they have as well as the deadly effects of toxic masculinity. 

However, there are details that do not fit the narrative. 

A. The shooter said that this was not racially motivated. 

B. The shooter killed a white woman and white man. 

C. While the shooter had shared a post critical of China https://twitter.com/yellokeith/status/1372202427584192513?s=09 it never rose beyond the national condemnation -- and the victims were Korean.

D. White nationalists in particular are well known for their love of Asian peoples and Asian culture, due to their valuation of ethnostates. 

E. Intentionally racist shootings usually come with racist manifestos, shamelessly racist worldviews, racist narratives about how white people are facing oppression. 

F. The #1 systemic discrimination Asian people face is from Progressives championing 'meritocracy is racist' and 'Asians are white-adjacent' inflammatory racial rhetoric, resulting in concrete discriminatory politics targeting Asian people specifically by their race. https://www.newsweek.com/asian-americans-emerging-strong-voice-against-critical-race-theory-opinion-1574503 

G. Criticism of China as a global, hegemonic, communist power is mainstream and not founded on race or xenophobia. 

It is my view Progressivism is a system which converts Trauma into capital. It seems as though these current narratives are forcing an anti-Asian narrative as a politically motivated strategy to appeal to build on this system. People like Trevor Noah believe killing six Asian people necessarily is a racist attack. But that strikes me as intentionally crude analysis. Isn't it racist for us to project all Asians onto China? Aren't we racistly manipulating the narrative when we selectively emphasize race to push politics, especially when said politics advocates for formally discriminating against Asians as "white-adjacent?"</original_post>

    <text>Obviously we don't have all the details yet. But one thing that strikes me is your reliance on a convoluted set of criteria to determine whether the shooter was a capital *R* Racist or not. None of that is relevant. 

If the shooter targeted Asians then it was a racist attack. It's that simple. We don't have to prove he is anti-China or a white nationalist or anything. We just have to prove he set out to kill Asians. He decided to go on a shooting rampage and it appears he was targeting Asian victims. So while not proof (I mean, sure it could have been all a coincidence) there are some strong indications that he targeted Asians and Asian businesses. It's pretty clear this isn't just your average random act of violence, he targeted specific places. 

Of course there is a chance that there was some other motivation that has nothing to do with race, like maybe these spa's ripped him off or something. But that seems pretty unlikely. The simplest explanation with the least amount of assumptions (Occam's razor) is that he was targeting Asians or Asian spas for some reason, which suggest racial motivations.

I think maybe your view rests pretty heavily on what you perceive as a liberal media narrative to tie this to conservatives or China or whatever. Proving that the media is wrong is not the same as proving that attack was not racially motivated. Even if the media is wrong about his motivations it can still be a hate crime. Like, at the end of the day this could just be a regular old racist dude that has no affiliation with Trump or white supremacy.</text>

    <text>I not arguing with your overall point but just curious not being even in the country. Is it *possible* that if he was targeting massage parlours  - that it’s possible that in that area or the parlour he knew they were all Asian. That he could have targeted them because he had a ‘problem’ with the job rather than the ethnicity? That it’s a misogynistic , violent crime against prostitutes in the parlours he knew?</text>

    <text>From the reports I’ve seen he was familiar with and maybe even frequented these places. I’m also not sure what the utility is in splitting hairs this finely.</text>

    <text>I guess I would have thought killing people because they are prostitutes who just happen to be Asian, is a significant difference from killing people because they are Asian who happen to also be prostitutes considering the significance of accusations of racism.</text>

    <text>My point was that it’s probably a factor of both rather than an exclusive either/or situation. 

He wasn’t targeting sex workers in general. He was targeting these women specifically.</text>

    <text>That may very well be true.</text>
