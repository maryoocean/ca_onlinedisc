    <title>Cmv: Psychology is fucked up</title>

Any major psychological study done mostly has involved unethical and morally questionable expirements behind it. Sure many good expirements have been done without harming any organism but that doesn't cause leaps in this department of science.


Things such as fear, isolation etc have only been studied by torturing and abusing many animals and humans in the past. The breakthroughs made then make psychology research today seem slow and less conclusive.


Take for example, Harlowâ€™s Pit of Despair or Stanford Prison Expirement or The Trolley Problem  or Milgrim's shocking obidence expirement.


Most will probably know these famous expirements because of their cruelty and discoveries unlike many good and positive expirements. 



It's ironical that the feild of study which needs to understand how the brain works needs a sacrifice of morals to progress quickly.</original_post>

    <text>What's fucked up is the pathology of our profit driven society that weaponizes mind control on its own citizens so these studies are the ones that get the most attention. Instead of say in a mentally health society that isn't profit driven would do an experiment of couples doing mdma together and seeing how many soul orgasms they can achieve in one session.</text>
