    <title>CMV: While the GME squeeze is a powerful display of retail trader’s power, there is no endgame that doesn’t result in them losing massive amount of money.</title>

    <original_post>The GameStop squeeze carried out by r/wsb and others demonstrated the power of retail traders and seems like a fair punishment on market makers and hedge funds that have taken advantage of the stock market for ages, but there is no way that it will end well for them. Sure, a lot of stock brokers have lost millions on shorts because retail traders refuse to sell and are still buying, but they can afford to do so because they have enormous amounts of cash to rest on and because GME is clearly overvalued. GME’s market cap is several times its revenue, and the only reason it is that high is because of the artificial demand created by internet communities. At some point, sellers are going to fold and GME is going to collapse, and everybody that purchased it when it was overvalued is going to lose massive amounts of money, while Wall Street short sellers laugh their way to the bank.</original_post>

But it ended long time ago for them. What WTB were planning already took place, it's over. Shorts were closed weren't they? That was the plan - to make hedge funds pump the stock by the way of short squeeze.

All we see now is emotional reaction to volatility, at least we saw that until some companies stopped making the stocks available for public. And we see this all the time, emotional buying fucks over people. Now, some buyers don't care and just want see hedge fund short sellers bleed, but those stupid enough to put money they cannot lose will be burned severely, as they always do. Just look at dogecoin...

Stock trading is zero sum game, if shorters on WS lost 70 bln some of it ended up in WTB pockets. And maybe they even held their positions after cashing out reasonable profits, just to say "f u". But if not all then most people who started this are covered with stop loss orders or even heavily in profit. Everything else happening is emotional market as usual. And  people are accountable for their own stupidity. What is different this time is that people with a lot of money were held accountable too by the retail traders and that has never happened before.</text>
