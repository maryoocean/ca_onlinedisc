    <title>CMV: French is the ugliest language on the planet.</title>
    <original_poster>Crayshack</original_poster>
    <original_post>When making a aesthetic assessment of anyone group of things, it is not that strange for one to end up on the bottom.  For languages, French occupies that position for me.  I would just accept this and not give it more thought, except for the fact that I will hear many people claiming french as one of, or possibly *the*, best sounding language on the planet.  I don't understand what they see in the language that makes it that appealing to them, and feel like I am missing something.

For perspective, to me French sounds like someone is trying not to vomit as they speak, and I can't think of anything appealing about how it sounds.  The best sounding languages in my mind is German, but there are a few others that are close enough to be effectively considered my favorite (including but not limited to: Swedish, Hawaiian, Russian, and Gaelic).

To get a delta, either find me a language that sounds worse than French, or give me reason to think that French sounds distinctly better than another language even if that language is not distinctly worse than some others.  I am discounting English and probably Spanish from consideration.  English is my native language, so it is difficult for me to make an assessment on how it sounds without considering the meaning of the words being used in the example.  Spanish is the most common second language where I grew up, so I learned some of it growing up and my opinion on it may be a bit clouded by experiences with communication difficulties between myself and people who spoke Spanish but not enough English.  I might be able to properly assess Spanish given the correct examples or perspective, but I would not count on it.

I will not accept a counter argument that my stance is not objective, because I think that aesthetics can only be assessed subjectively.  If you can argue for there being objective criteria, I will give you a delta.</original_post>

    <text>I would like to post one of my favorite french songs from a legendary musical play Notre Dame de Paris [Ces diamants-la](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxD-sJIQpxk)

There is a reason why many people all across the world call French the language of love. In songs and in speech it can sound absolutely beautiful and pleasing to the ear. I don't know how you can call it the ugliest language on the planet when it can produce such amazing works of art as Notre Dame de Paris.</text>

    <text>I got a few seconds in before I couldn't stand it anymore.  It honestly sounds like vomit is bubbling out of her mouth as she sings and I can't stand it.  For a counter argument, I would like to post some [Mozart in German](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2ODfuMMyss).</text>
