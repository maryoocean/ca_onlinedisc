    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>The problem is that while there are nearly 1 million cops in the US and 300 million civilians resulting in hundreds of millions of interactions per day between cops and civilians we are shown only the 1 or 2 worst interactions that happen each day. And for good reason. It's manufactured public outrage.

For weeks, months, years. We are conditioned through media. Everything we know is the result of what they have selected for us to see what they have chosen for us to bicker about.</text>
