    <original_post>I'm sorry but as an artist and painter it grinds my gears when I see all these tik toks with artist wasting paint. I understand splatter painting to a degree. A few droplets aren't going to kill anybody but when it is just people throwing paint cans and it ect it's ridiculous. It's pretentious and honestly your not really making art. Your making just a mess and it's incredibly wasteful. 

In the age of environmental destruction paint is one of the worst and most toxic things you can emit into the world. There's been multiple articles and studies on how it facilitates climate change and all manner of other issues! If you're going to use a resource like paint use it efficiently!

If you don't you're kind of an ass.

Shit my link wasn't saved. What I mean by wast is this art trend https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRM7gN4y/?k=1</original_post>

    <text>They are as wasteful as someone like Banksy making his art self shred, or someone making an ice sculpture that will just melt. Or someone putting gold leaf on a cake. Art is not a necessity of life. It is by definition a waste, apart from  to those who enjoy it.

They are all forms of art. All are less wasteful than a formula one driver spaffing fuel and rubber to spin around a track several times as fast as possible.</text>
