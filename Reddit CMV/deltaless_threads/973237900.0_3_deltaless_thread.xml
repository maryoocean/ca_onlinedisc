    <title>CMV: It makes sense that police would be more violent on average than other people because the job naturally appeals to control freaks.</title>

    <original_post>(Disclaimer:This isn't an ACAB post. I think many cops are good people doing a job that society needs, and I'm not here to say that every cop is bad  or violent or that we should abolish police.)

A study in the 90s found that about 40% of cops were reported for domestic violence as opposed to 10% of the general population. I know that study is outdated, and may not be entirely accurate, but it makes sense that cops would be more violent on average than regular people because the job naturally appeals to control freaks.

The job largely entails enforcing rules, giving people orders that they have to obey, and physically coercing them if they don't comply. Even if the cop's order is unlawful, you're generally advised to obey anyway and take it to court later. If someone is naturally power-hungry, this is the kind of job that would appeal to them.

Again, I'm not saying every cop is bad or violent. I think their job is necessary and I think a lot of cops are good people, but the job itself  attracts control freaks.</original_post>

    <text>I think it has more to do with adaptation than base traits.

For example if you work at mcdonalds, youre probably gonna deal with more morbidly obese person than the average worker. Just as well, if youre a police officer youre more likely to deal with violent individuals.

So, while rookies may be more lenient and cool-headed, the longer youre in the force the more you adapt to the nature of your duties. Cops arent dealing with safe people most of the time. While most of us only deal with cops when we blow a stop sign or drive a little too fast and think 'fuck this guy with nothing better to do, whys he such a dick', we dont realize an hour prior they may have been apprehending a rapist or robbery suspect, maybe even visiting a brutal crime scene.

That kinda shit takes a toll on you the first time and the 30th time. After a while, it becomes a part of them to be more aggressive or controlling. Just like if you were some kinda physicist and after a while you start seeing algorithms everywhere.

Basically, the jobs we have tend to shape us. Not saying being a cop doesnt appeal to control freaks, just that its more likely to turn people into them. After all, cops do suffer disciplinary measures all the time. Cops get fired all the time. We only hear about the worst cases because it makes the news when police beat an unarmed innocent person or raid the wrong house and someone ends up injured or dead and nothing happens to anyone. Not necessarily when one oversteps their bounds and is correctly punished.</text>
