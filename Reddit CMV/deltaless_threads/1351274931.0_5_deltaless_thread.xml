    <title>CMV: Pet stores should not be legally permissible</title>
    <original_poster>theArchivesAreAshes</original_poster>
    <original_post>I just can't understand a humane reason for putting ~25 animals in small glass boxes/cages for weeks on end, sometimes sedated. What do they do with the puppies that don't sell? How is it any different than puppy milling? 
Until the populations in animal shelters approache more manageable levels, I don't understand why retail stores where you pick out living things like shoes would be permissible.  

The sale of cats and dogs specifically disturbs me, especially when they are in tanks like gerbils. They are offered for sale in the same context as products you can return or exchange, which seems to lead many patrons to do just that. What is the mindset here? 

I can only imagine that patrons of those stores and either looking for a specific breed or are warey of shelters for some reason. That's why I'm asking, because I can't come up with a good reason. I would need to be shown how they can provide more good than harm for animals to change my view.</original_post>

    <text>I first want to comment that "pick out living things like shoes" is very confusing and funny when you read it as saying that shoes are living things. 

It should be legal as long as the animals they sell come from a shelter or are procured from a humane source. 

People who frequent pet stores presumably already like animals and seeing the ones for sale as you go purchase the things you need for the ones you already own may tempt you into buying another one and thus give said animal a good home.</text>

    <text>If they are from a shelter and being displayed in a pet accessory store to assist in adoption, I completely agree.
I am referring more to pet stores in malls and such that do not focus on pet accessories.</text>
