    <title>I don't think the NSA spying on us is such a big deal. CMV</title>

    <original_post>Here is my reasoning: growing up parallel to the development of the internet my parents always warned me that anything you put into a computer someone out there can see. It is permanent. So I have always assumed there is always someone watching. That assumption at the end of the day hasn't really changed what I put on the internet because everything is strictly my opinion and I don't care what others think of it.

As far as the recording of phone conversations and storing of email, that is just a case of national security. these things need to be saved in case someone is planning a terrorist attack on our nation IMO.	

I am just a normal citizen like many of you, but my opinion differs on this subject matter and I want to understand what the big fuss about it is. It has always just been a common knowledge and understanding for me that I am being watched.</original_post>

    <text>In my opinion the biggest problem is that Congress authorized the NSA to get judicial permission to spy on foreigners they had reasonable suspicion were involved in terrorism, for a limited amount of time.  The NSA ignored those legal restrictions and recorded everything on everyone and justified it by saying they wouldn't really look most of it so it is okay.  Many people here are saying what the NSA did was unconstitutional, but because all of this was secret, nobody was able to challenge the NSA interpretation in court.  The end result is that this is a serious breach of our structure of government, in which the executive branch is asserting power that the legislative branch didn't intend to give them.  The people have no chance for remediation in the legislative or judicial branches because most legislators don't know about this and the judiciary can't overturn a law unless someone challenges it--which nobody can legally do, since it is all secret.

Some people, believe the NSA should have this power, but if that is the case, the legislature should pass laws clearly granting them this power, and the public should be able to ask the courts to rule that the law violates the constitution.</text>
