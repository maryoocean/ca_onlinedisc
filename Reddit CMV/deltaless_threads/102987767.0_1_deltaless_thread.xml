    <title>Christianity is fine, but the modern world would be a be a better place without Islam. CMV</title>

    <original_post>I'll preface the statement by saying that from a completely ideological perspective, I understand that Islam is experiencing the same thing Christianity experienced in the Middle Ages. Additionally, I do not think that Islam is an inherently bad institution, I jus believe that it's a driving force for far too many problems. Every week, we here about honor killings and suicide bombings. With the recent mall takeover in Kenya, I simply can no longer believe that Islam is a positive institution. I would like to believe that Islam can be a positive institution, but ultimately it's a net negative on society and the world would be a happier, safer place without it.</original_post>

    <text>To be honest, the modern world would be better without horrible human beings who are quick to disguise their wickedness by some religion, don't you think so?
Religions are not at fault here, humans are.</text>
