    <original_post>Homosexuality is not natural, and neither is heterosexuality

There is no such thing as attraction in other mammal species, just the male raping the female and reproducing. 

Attraction in humans is a social construct. It's a way to soothe people or to bond similar to how bonobos do it.

Because us humans have “the instinctive need to produce offspring,” the sheer fact that men want to have PiV sex with women just for fun or without wanting kids, proves it's not a natural attraction.

Plus, most women don't care about being penetrated. It doesn't feel good for us, clitoral stimulation is a need for most. PiV sex has no purpose outside of getting pregnant. Sexual relationships are not necessary at all.</original_post>

    <text>I disagree. The strongest natural instinct is self preservation.

History is simply flooded with examples of people deliberately sacrificing themselves for their loved ones.

Also, your commentary on reproduction just bring rape. That’s demonstrated incorrect in nature. There dozens of species of birds, insects, and mammals where the female chooses a mate.</text>
