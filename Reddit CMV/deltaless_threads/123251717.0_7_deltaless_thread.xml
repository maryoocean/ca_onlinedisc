    <title>CMV: I do not believe in any absolute morality.</title>
    <original_poster>CARTARS22</original_poster>
    <original_post>Probably in reaction to my rebellion to my Christian upbringing, I have a hard time accepting any objective morality. I understand Christian morality, but as a non-christian I recognize my moral feels as a neurological response trained by evolution and society. I don't believe in any connection between myself and those I "care" about. I believe that I (humanity) act on what will have positive effects on my feelings, and that is the only reason I help others. How can there be a morality that stands above my self-preservation.

    <text>The biggest problem with subjective truth, and, by extension, objective morality, is that it conflicts so often and so easily. If there are two "truths" which happen to contradict each other, then one of those "truths" must logically be wrong. Even if it is impossible to prove which one is actually 100 percent correct, that does not make it any less true, and so we cannot throw truth out of the window just because it is hard to prove. The same thing goes for morality.</text>
