    <title>CMV: Sustainability, from a philosophical perspective, is misguided</title>
    <original_poster>Pyropeace</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've been an advocate of sustainability for a while. However, I've recently begun to question the underlying assumptions behind the sustainability movement. 

Nothing is truly, infinitely sustainable. The sun will eventually go nova, killing everyone on earth (if humans haven't already gone extinct by then). If humanity manages to escape Earth, then the universe will likely perish as well, depending on what model you accept. The universe is in a constant state of change, and nothing lasts forever. Is it better to be moderately happy for a long period of time or extremely happy for a short period of time? When talking about entire societies, I tend towards the latter, though on an individual basis I tend towards the former. 

Essentially, my question is this; what is the value in things that last a long time in a universe where nothing is eternal?</original_post>

    <text>Well, the engineer's answer is "It'll last long enough".

We'll die eventually. But we've got vested interests in ensuring that this doesn't happen sooner than it needs to. And as you say, we've got a number of different timeframes to choose from, just right now.

What if we discover new universes?

Sustainability is only misguided when we're finally fucked. Except even then, a life well lived, a society well-constructed, something to really mourn when it passes, is worth creating, just for it having lived.</text>
