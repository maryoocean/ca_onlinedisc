    <original_post>I believe homeless spikes are wrong.

I think homeless spikes should be removed. I believe you will always have rough sleepers (although we could probably drastically reduce the amount in the UK) and as such should not introduce such measures.

I just donâ€™t get the justification.

EDIT: Anybody who wants can sleep in my garden, or outside my house. If I didn't live with someone else who'd be worried about getting his stuff pinched I'd let anybody who asked sleep in my house, although I wouldn't let them have my room n I'd keep the door locked. There is very little to steal that I own.

I've never owned a car, never will, I just cannot justify it morally because of the environmental damage they cause. If I did own one I would let people sleep in it.

I do see a massive difference between putting spikes in what is a pubic place (regardless of who 'owns' it) and not letting homeless people sleep in your house though. I think it's moot.

    <text>In SF where there's a homeless problem, businessowners have to post a notice saying that they intend to enforce the law and not let people sleep/loiter in their storefronts.  There are sanitation and garbage issues.  Making employees wake up people who are in the storefront who have a higher than normal chance of mental health issues presents a possible safety issue.  Anyways, if the law is broken, then the cops have to get involved.  It takes up their time and effort because they have to then get the homeless guy to a shelter or process them or something which isn't a good use of their time.  </text>
