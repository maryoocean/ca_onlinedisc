    <title>I believe the courting process should be eliminated entirely from sex, CMV.</title>

    <original_post>I don’t think that pursuing someone solely for the purpose of having sex with them, even if you don’t know them intimately, should be cause for judgment. Proposing sex to a friend, acquaintance, or stranger with no intentions of furthering an emotional connection or relationship should be acceptable. I believe our society has a strange and harmful dichotomy of attitudes towards sex - it saturates so much of our culture but is somewhat taboo on an interpersonal basis. I think that any limitations on sexual expression and release among consenting adults are harmful and cause unnecessary stress, and our society would benefit from fostering a more relaxed attitude towards sexual intimacy overall. 

tl;dr Casual sex should be acceptable and encouraged.</original_post>

    <text>I can see your point about removing social stigma from casual sex, but why have you said "I believe the courting process should be eliminated entirely from sex"? Courting doesn't exist because of the social stigma surrounding casual sex, courting exists because we like to get to know people before engaging in such an intimate act. Even if there was no stigma for having casual sex people would still engage in courting, because courting is what makes them interested in having sex with people in the first place.</text>
