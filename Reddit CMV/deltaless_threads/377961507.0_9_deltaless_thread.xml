    <title>CMV: A computer could do 90% of a doctor's job (general practitioner in particular).</title>
    <original_poster>OnlyOnceThreetimes</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have numerous medical conditions throughout my life and I have many friends who are doctors.  All the doctors I have visited have been terrible at their jobs.  Whether it is complete disinterest, misdiagnosis, unknowledgeable of symptoms indicating problems, misreading x-rays/cat scans, etc.  Any condition that has been solved has been me fighting the medical system with information i've researched on the internet.

If we started a database that tracked symptom of patients, eventually we'd see what percentage of particular symptoms indicate a particular disease/condition/disorder/etc.

I understand people do their own research on Web MD and often go to a doctor and a doctor laughs and tells them what they read is incorrect, but this is because WebMD is not considering everything else about the patient.  

For instance low blood pressure in a 24 year old athlete is not an indicator of a problem as it would be for say an old sedentary and obese 65 year old male. 

Doctors should be detectives, puzzle solvers or scientists, but often I find they are quick to get you in and out of your office for that paycheck.  They see too many patience to devote enough time to solve your obscure case.  And let's say it is indeed an obscure case.  Imagine only 100 people have had your condition, no doctor could ever be expected to piece together the puzzle.  But if those 100 people were logged,  the computer could compare against that.

At best we could train individuals to be intermediaries between the patient and the computer system, so training for general practitioners could be lowered considerably.   And in doing so, their pay would be much lower which would allow money to be used for other things.  more testing labs, more MRI machines, etc.

Imagine going into the automated medical facility and getting your blood work and cat-scan done all in one place.  It would seem to me that your chance of a correct diagnosis would be MUCH higher than dealing with a human.  Most of medical school is just learning IMMENSE text book knowledge and analysis skills, both of which are best handled by a computer.

I mean, we're already doing creating these databases. But how do we know what symptoms to check? How do we actually measure these symptoms? Doctors, and records of doctor notes, are integral to this loop.

Computers are great at finding patterns in large datasets. However, generally they do so in a supervised way, where they need data that is labelled by experts (doctors). They can do some unsupervised pattern recognition, such as anomaly detection or clustering, but they can't really interpret or follow up on these results. Also, they often only perform as well as the dataset, and can sometimes find false patterns when given bad data. I remember an academic talk where a computer falsely concluded that asthmatics have lower risk of death due to pneumonia, a conclusion that is ridiculous from a medical standpoint. Turns out, this was because since it had long been recognized that they were at higher risk of death, they were more likely to receive more intensive health care when they go to the hospital, and thus their frequency of death was actually lower than average, resulting in a false interpretation by the computer that they were at lower risk. Acting on false patterns or diagnoses can have hugely negative health consequences, and raise a huge question about liability. Doctors are integral for interpreting and acting upon the suggestions of computers.

&amp;gt; And let's say it is indeed an obscure case. Imagine only 100 people have had your condition, no doctor could ever be expected to piece together the puzzle. But if those 100 people were logged, the computer could compare against that.

How would a computer know you have the condition in the first place if it is so rare or novel? Either the computer will falsely label your condition as one that it is more familiar with (classification problem), or it will identify it as an anomaly that it doesn't know how to follow up on (outlier detection problem). How would a computer know what to do next? For a novel or rare illness, a computer can't plan research studies, contact colleagues, or creatively innovate treatments.

&amp;gt; Imagine going into the automated medical facility and getting your blood work and cat-scan done all in one place.

Some lab tests are expensive, some lab tests carry health risks, some lab tests can't be automated, and there is a huge number of possible lab tests. Someone has to make choices about what lab tests to prioritize. Simple things like blood work are already done primarily by lab technicians, not doctors.


Big shared databases and machine learning are already starting to spread in healthcare, and they have the potential to transform medical practice. However, doctors are rightfully wary, given the huge potential for negative health consequences from false positives from trusting computers too much. I think computers can be a great tool for medicine, and doctors should be trained to use them *as tools* to help their practice.</text>
