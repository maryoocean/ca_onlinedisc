    <title>CMV: Fire departments (USA) shouldn't be able to bill people/companies for fighting fires, rescuing people or doing any other aspect of their job.</title>
    <original_poster>chrislstark</original_poster>
    <original_post>Lately I've seen an increase in news stories of individuals and companies being handed multi thousand dollar bills because the fire department had to come do their job. First it was just for people who were doing malicious or criminal things (like setting off illegal fireworks). Then I started seeing them for people doing stupid but not illegal things (like trying to drive across a fast moving river or kill a spider using a lighter and a can of hairspray). But it has more recently been for people who are victims of accidents and people who tried to do things correctly and with the best of intentions (like the guy who fell off a cliff while on a mountain bike ride or the church who was fined after their model rocket science project malfunctioned and started a fire). 

I believe this is a dangerous trend. Fire departments are paid with tax dollars. If fire departments begin to rely on funds from individuals it becomes incentive to allow problems to get worse before coming to solve them because it means a bigger bill at the end. We have already seen this happen with police departments and traffic tickets. They used to be issued as a deterrent to dangerous behavior but now, since police departments rely on the revenue to even function properly, they are being issued for things that aren't even illegal with the knowledge that most people won't fight it. A red light camera investigation exposed several around the country as being intentionally timed to ticket people who ran the yellow and not the red. 

Fire departments should continue to be paid by tax dollars so they never have a monetary incentive to do their jobs poorly.</original_post>

    <text>I've seen cases where people who have automated alarms that keep misalarming for fires get fined.  I don't have a problem with that - yeah, responding to alarms is the FD's job, but if you don't maintain your system or call off the false alarms, your neighbor's shouldn't have to pay the bill.

There are also cases where FD's charge to respond to calls in areas that chose not to have a fire department (or contract with neighboring towns).  Again, if I'm paying for a FD and you aren't, yeah, I don't want to give you a gimme.

Without specific citations, though, it's hard to respond to your claims - we just don't know the details of the situation.</text>

    <text>Yah those things are exactly the same as fining people who prank call 911 or police officers getting cash to secure large events, which is totally normal.</text>

    <text>What if a person does nothing wrong and a fire randomly starts, should the property owner be fined even if they did nothing wrong?</text>

    <text>If they are in a jurisdiction which pays for a fire department, no, I think that should be what you are paying for.</text>
