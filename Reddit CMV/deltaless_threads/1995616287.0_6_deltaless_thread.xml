    <title>CMV:Germany could not win WW2</title>
    <original_poster>Niberus</original_poster>
    <original_post>I’ve often heard that if Germany did something different one way or another then they could have won WW2 however, I'd argue that they had no chance to win no matter what they would have done (a realistic way that is). 

From attacking the French and English in the west, to trying to subjugate various countries in the Balkans to having the brilliant idea of invading the Soviet Union, the Germans just kept making the war harder for themselves whilst making their goals further and further unreachable as the war staggered on and they were eventually chased all the way back to Berlin.

Not exactly sure what was going through Hitler’s brain at the time or when he ended his life in the Fuhrer bunker though I have to imagine that whatever mistakes he might have wanted to avoid at various points of the war it would still have ended terribly for them.

From the Allies having the control of most of the world’s resources, to the Soviet Union being too big of a block to try and knock down, to the unstable and unreliable allies that Germany had on its side, to the ideological zeal that prevented many alliances that could have taken place simply vanishing into the wind, to the massive industrial output being underestimated by the axis, to the poor planning of certain plans, to the various manpower issues that Germany suffered from, to the poor prioritization in subjecting various “””subhuman””” (their words not mine) cultures or deficiencies of human beings rather than building more war material.

Another issue is that time was simply not on Germany’s side due to all the continuing escalations that were occurring from the Japanese and Italians that various other powers were going to be fighting Germany regardless thereby tipping the scales even if the Germans wanted to keep the war on a small scale. While I won’t say that the Americans or Soviets would inevitably join if the Germans decided to draw the war out, it certainly didn’t look positive for them either. Secondly the British simply wouldn’t have fallen or settled for a white peace as they had the industry and manpower to fight on and had a superior air force to begin bombing Germany itself during nighttime. The Soviets had the manpower and industry to fight on and a massive distance between the German army and the relocated industry in the Urals. And the Americans? Well they had so much that they could sustain a war on two front against two major enemies that Germany itself could only have dreamed of either from the First World War or from the Second World War that they ended up losing anyway.

With all of this in mind, I just do not see a (rational and realistic) way in which the Germans could win. Everything was against them from the very beginning in the invasion of the Second Polish Republic to the scorching deserts of North Africa, to the hellscape of Far Eastern Europe to the collapse of the Reich itself. 

Would be welcome to changing my mind…</original_post>

    <text>If they did not invade the USSR, if they pulled back on attempts to invade England after Dunkirk, if they did not declare war on the US, and if they did not invade Africa, they would have limited their exposure to areas too large to capture quickly, and avoided conflict with countries with the resources to defeat them. 

The US didn't want to enter the war. Forces in England would have pulled Churchill back when it was clear that  England wouldn't  be invaded. Hitler could focus efforts in the west instead of Russia. Eventually, the world would stop confronting Germany because nobody wanted war with Germany in the first place.</text>

    <text>Unfortunately you would have to fundamentally change who the Nazis are for them to not go ahead with the decisions that they did.

Particularly the USSR with their previous lighting successes in France and the Balkans, Hitler believed that a campaign in the east could be won in just 3-4 months which was backed up with the low oil supplies in the Reich that meant that Germany's tanks and planes would be useless without the fuel to run them (something that was abundant in the Caucasus) for any further fights Germany may have had.

There was also ideological stubbornness as invading the Soviet Union and setting up for Lebensraum was a prime goal and Hitler wasn't going to miss it for the world.</text>

    <text>So you are saying that if the nazis were fundamentally changed, they could have won the war? And the fundamental change you need is for Hitler to believe that a campaign in the East will take years?

That doesn't sound like a massive change in how Hitler acted. He could have just won the war spent a few years building up oil and planes and tanks and then smashed Russia.</text>

That's something that I am split on as better decisions would have been made most certainly however, their impact is something that is debatable. Regardless that's a fantasy scenario that we'll never know</text>
