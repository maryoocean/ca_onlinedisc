    <title>CMV: Activity on the internet should be much more heavily regulated</title>
    <original_poster>e05bf027</original_poster>
    <original_post>Before I begin, I understand how unpopular the following will be on a site such as this, but I really want to hear opinions. I have, over the last little while, gone from feeling that essentially unregulated and uncensored activity on the internet is a good thing, to believing the opposite. Here are my reasons, though not in a particularly lucid or well-structured form. Also, I understand that the gap between principle and practicality is vast, so I offer my points only as ethical ones.

Libel: Essentially the internet is a publishing platform. If a newspaper or other media outlet has to obey the laws of libel and defamation, should an individual who is publishing things publicly not have to do the same? As an example, earlier I read a comment in a thread about Ted Nugent. The comment made a fairly strong statement regarding his sexual preferences. If this was on TV or in a newspaper, the outlet would be in seriously dodgy territory. In this case, an anonymous person can say anything and gets to live by different rules, despite the intention being to publish their view for worldwide public consumption. I think this is wrong.

Data protection: Despite the above, I think companies should be extremely limited regarding what data they are allowed to store about people. The fact that millions of lines of code in various places churn through my online activity and that Google, Amazon, etc. have a virtual model of me should not be allowed. For example, Amazon should not be allowed to record the history of what I browse. I see this as akin to having a shop assistant follow you round a store with a camcorder as you browse and believe that companies who do this should be heavily prosecuted.

Piracy: I understand that the issue of piracy is a complex one, but I feel that a growing attitude treats all information in digital form as almost a right. I think this is wrong, and that all copyright laws should be equal regardless of whether someone sells fake DVDs from their car boot, or runs a torrenting site. I believe that Google should not list any sits that link to illegal copyright infringement, and that they are complicit in the violations of law.

Now, I understand that there are a great deal of complicated parts of this, especially when it comes to things like expressing dissident political views, government surveillance, etc. and I know how ill-formed my point is. I suppose that by offering these views for criticism and rebuttal I want help clarifying what I truly think.

TLDR: Unregulated, anonymous activity that is largely without personal consequence is not a good thing. People should be as liable for what they do online as if they did it on TV or in the middle of the street. 

Edit 1: let me be explicit in saying that I am not claiming innocence of any of these things, but that recently I have been asking myself ethical questions and an uncomfortable with answers I find myself giving, and my beliefs are changing because of it.

Edit 2: I have to go out for the rest of the night, but I will reply tomorrow and give more thought to all points made. Thanks for taking the time to reply, I already have a lot of food for thought.

    <text>&amp;gt; Libel

An important part of the reasoning of Libel laws is the authenticity that publishing affords the speaker. Someone speaking in private or a single voice in a large crowd has no substantial weight behind their words with which to cause damage. Note that libel is also a contended legal position due to the conflict between libel and free speech.

&amp;gt; Data protection

There is a lot more regulation of this than most people are aware of, though there are still significant weak points. However, the level of protection is comparable on-line and off. It is merely the efficiency of collection that gives rise to the various problems on-line.

&amp;gt; Piracy

Copyright violation used to be considered acceptable so long as it was not done with a profit motive. The purpose was to prevent publishers from undercutting the publisher who actually payed the original writer. Additionally, copyright was strictly limited in scope because of conflicts with free speech. In this way, copyright is in much the same position as libel. However, like data protection, the increased efficiency creates significant changes in the effects of copyright violations.

It is worth noting that the purpose of copyright is in dispute. However, the most commonly given purpose of promoting the arts and sciences makes copyright thoroughly redundant with respect to the arts in light of the sheer proliferation of free artwork online.</text>
