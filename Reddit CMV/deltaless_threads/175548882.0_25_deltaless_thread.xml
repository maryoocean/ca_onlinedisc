    <title>CMV: Public transportation should run 24/7.</title>
    <original_poster>Keep-reefer-illegal</original_poster>
    <original_post>We live in a world that is no longer 9-5. Businesses stay open later, friends can reach us with a portable device simply by typing on a mini keyboard. It doesn't make sense that public transportation isn't 24/7. Here are some reasons why it should be 24/7:

1. Very few buses run at 2 am for last call, I feel like if nothing else, running buses later let's responsible drunk people take public transit instead of driving home. 

2. It would benefit the working poor who may work night shift 

3. As mentioned before our world is now 24/7 

Those are my arguments. 

I encourage you all to change my view 

Edit: by transit I am including trains, buses, all forms of public transportation, not just buses.

    <text>I don't think "should" is arguable.  Of course Public Transportation "should" run 24/7.  

The challenge with this is logistics.  Specifically cost.  Let's say you only have enough money to staff your bus system for one 8-hour shift per day.  When do you run it?  Probably during the time of day when most people will commute.

Public transportation can recoup some of this expense with passenger fares, but this only works when the system is full.  

In New York, public transit runs 24/7, but on a less frequent schedule on holidays and late at night.  This is probably the best way to go, but not all cities can finance this type of schedule. 

In cities where driving is more prominent, it is more difficult to get voters to pass tax increases to finance public transit, and less money is earned from fares.  </text>
