    <title>CMV: America has far greater freedom of speech than Europe.</title>
    <original_poster>achicomp</original_poster>
    <original_post>My view is that free speech is factually more free in America than the European Union + UK overall. None of the following ever happens in America and never could under the US constitution:

In Austria, a woman was **convicted for blasphemy** when she called the Prophet Muhammad a pedophile. In Austria, Germany and Poland the offence carries a potential prison sentence as well as a fine.

In France, 12 protesters were **fined** for supporting the boycott of Israel.

In Denmark, a politician was **convicted for burning Korans.**

A German politician was **criminally charged** for calling migrants “scum.”

In England, a Baptist minister was **jailed overnight** for preaching against homosexuality and a man was investigated for telling a Nelson Mandela **joke**.

Also in a poll of German citizens. Only 18% of Germans feel free to express their opinions in public. 59% of Germans did not even feel free expressing themselves in private among friends. And just 17% felt free to express themselves on the Internet.

    <text>Just copied from another post but...

There are also plenty of examples of people being arrested or prosecuted for exercising their 'freedom of speech' in the US.

For saying 'fuck'.

    <text>None of these examples show that Europe has freer speech.

1. And 3. Your links don’t work for the fuck arrests

2. This is assault when your speech by sending flashing strobe lights intentionally causes someone to seize. Not protected speech. Not protected in US and Europe.

4. This person used their words to directly convince someone to kill themselves and told them exactly what to buy and do to kill themselves. This is no different than telling someone you will kill them. Not protected speech in the US or Europe.

5. Was this teen convicted or not?

6. Threatening and calling others to burn someone’s house down is not protected speech in the US or Europe

7. Child porn is illegal in the US and Europe. Not protected speech</text>

    <text>Your claim is that America has more free speech than the EU, not that the EU has less free speech than the US, so they are providing links that disprove that?

Also, yeah, some of the things aren't protected by free speech, which literally does prove your point to be moot. If the US had "more" free speech than the EU, then you could say all of that shit and would still be protected under free speech.</text>
