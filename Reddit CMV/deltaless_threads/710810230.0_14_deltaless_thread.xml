    <title>CMV: High school literature and history courses fail to provide meaningful educational value</title>
    <original_poster>dabears_24</original_poster>
    <original_post>In their current form, high school courses focused on history and literature fail to provide meaningful educational benefits. 

These classes commonly have a goal of improving critical thinking skills and develop advanced literacy. However, the format of current history courses where students heavily analyze past events, does not emphasize critical thinking, but rather focuses on memorization of history that has little to no significance in the present. Literature classes that focus on deep analysis of *important* texts like Shakespeare's works, complex poetry, or stylistic writing (i.e. stream-of-consciousness in "Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man") do not develop readinc/writing skills applicable to students' lives or modern texts. They also tend to foster dislike for reading when students are forced to extract meaning from texts they do not value or understand.

I believe a courses in debate, critical analysis of nonfiction works (i.e. argumentative opinion pieces), or even literary analysis of more familiar works would all be better alternatives to detailed US history or general literature courses.

Since this is a broad statement with caveats, I'll clarify in a list:

- I am not arguing the classes offer zero value. The concept of being in an educational environment likely has benefits itself, so my view will not be changed by arguments of the form "all education has value".


- I acknowledge the value of basic history lessons in understand society, culture, and history that affects us today. I am arguing that there is little to no value in all students having to learn of details like specific battles of the Civil War, or the politics of the early 1800s. These topics should be pursed electively.


- I am not arguing that these classes lack value only because they do not tie to future careers. I believe these two courses majorly fail to provide value. I agree that math and science courses do not necessarily tie into future work, but I believe they accomplish their goals more effectively.

I admit I may display a STEM-favoring bias due to my field of study and work, so I am willing to accept arguments that show that my view is a function solely of my bias and not of reason.

EDIT: Want to clarify that I still think history should be taught at a general level in school. I don't think it should be as detailed or exhaustive as a part of the core curriculum. In other words, I think the necessary history can be taught in fewer total classes

EDIT 2: Pretty late in the cycle now, but I'll add this regardless since I've engaged with a lot of arguments that misinterpret my post. I am not arguing against the value of History and Literature. I am saying these classes are ineffective in their current forms</original_post>

    <text>I suspect that underlying your belief is a disinterest in certain subject matters, and you are questioning their relevancy based on your own focuses and needs. 

I am not convinced that relevancy should be the standard of education.  Let me give you an example.  My father was a military history buff. Every summer vacation, we would be dragged to a battlefield or two.  As a child, I visited all manner of major battleground and fort in the United States -- Gettysburg, Vicksburg, Fort Ticonderoga, Concord, Lexington, the Alamo, Little Big Horn, Pearl Harbor, and others.  I was not the least bit interested in these places at the time.  However, as an adult I have come to appreciate these experiences and acknowledge that I absorbed more than I thought I did. None of this information applies to my daily life and certainly not to my vocation. However, I am a more rounded and dare I say more interesting person having learned what I did during these trips. 

We also need to consider how material is taught. Not all teachers are good at their craft. Watching the Ken Burns documentary on the Civil War would be far more interesting than listening to certain teachers drone on. I contrast that with other teachers who riveted me with their presentations. I had a history teacher in high school who had me enthralled with stories about Teddy Roosevelt. I had absolutely no interest in Teddy Roosevelt until that class. 

Literature is something else entirely. It is art. It needs to be appreciated and understood in that context. Art isn't judged by its relevancy.  You do not weep at the base of David or after listening to Placido Domingo sing Nessun Dorma and ask yourself, "How will this help me repair my lawn mower?"  That said, art is contextual. Michaelangelo worked under the auspices of powerful patrons. Who were those patrons? What were their goals?  How did they enhance or curtail his art? How did they come to be so powerful and rich?  That, my friend, is history. Art always lives in the context of history. William Wordsworth and James Baldwin were both poets. They lived in different times, had different experiences, and had different contexts for their art. Their art reflects the economic, social, political, and aesthetic of their times. It all interconnects. 

Science discoveries and advancements are also products of their times. Do we want space travel? Do we want to create a weapon that could destroy us all?  Do we want a cure for a disease that is ravaging a socially marginalized segment of society? Do we need to invent a replacement for rubber?  Who is paying for and patronizing this research?  This, too, is history.</text>

    <text>I'll disagree with the first paragraph. I may be disinterested in literature, but my post is a consequence of my frustration with others' lack of understanding of history. I understand this sounds dense as if I know better than them.

But I cannot engage in discussion with many peers or other people in general about how our nationalist trends today mirror historical trends, such as the anti-Communist fever in the 1900s. And it's not because people don't know the facts. Those I can easily present or they can learn. But people have not been effectively taught how to take history and analayze it to have meaning today. I believe that is a fundamental failure in the way history is being taught</text>

    <text>That involves critical thinking. Can that be taught? To some degree it can. I recall a teacher drawing parallels between what happened to Charles I of England and Richard Nixon during the Watergate era. The teacher obviously wanted us to see what he saw.  We were led during these discussions. 

Do you want the same?  Do your views seem so obvious to you that they move beyond opinion to fact? Do you want to lead people to certain conclusions?</text>
