    <title>I believe humans need their rights limited to ensure survival of our species. CMV.</title>

    <original_post>This is something I've believed for a while. As a species, humans are self-destructive. We procreate too much and consume too many resources. I believe that something like China's one-child policy should be instituted in as many countries as possible to curb population growth. ~~I think currency should be done away with and governments should provide housing and necessities while the population works for the betterment and survival of humanity as a whole rather than for monetary compensation.~~

Am I crazy to think this is how the world should be? 

EDIT: Perhaps eliminating currency would be more problematic than keeping it.</original_post>

To take your logic to the next step:

If the government should control basic human rights for the greater good of the society, should they:

Only allow productive families that can have productive children to have kids?  Basically, why let poor people have children?  They are only going to grow up poor, and be more likely to be a criminal.  Why not only let rich/productive people have kids? </text>

    <text>No, that's not at all what the OP said. You're implying discrimination. Captialism itself leads to greater inequality, and by adding some limits, you only increase the equality.

That's an oversimplification, of course.  
Capitalism alongside corporate centered tax codes leads to inequality, but adding limits wouldn't increase equality in the minds of business minded republicans because they feel less regulation or restriction leads to more innovation and better wages and societal progress by trusting that the right people get paid for their services in a discerning economy, so obviously there's more to it than what you've just put here.  
For instance, I have no idea why education takes a back seat in a capitalist economy like America, and why certain republicans seem to always have the worst education policies. As a republican, if we want the world to get better, we need educated consumers who choose more carefully what businesses they support in what amount, a la starving the beast.  
It's almost as if republicans have become so irritated over regulation in the past fifty years that they actually want to starve the poor of decent education as some kind of payback for not being able to rise to the potential they feel they should be able to rise to, and take the country with them. So they think they're being dragged down, and now they're going to take everyone with them but bolster the military and hurt education which... I don't know. Is somehow supposed to make their income stream more guaranteed? Republican military contractors, soldiers who vote republican, and the uneducated poor who prop up over-regulated corporations are all income streams that get focused on while dragging the country down, or something.  
It's all very complex of course.  
Getting people to admit what their actual intent is is hard enough, add in having them admit all the things they actually use to nuance their understanding and justify how they respond and you've got a situation that will just never occur.  
People are way too interested in lying to preserve their lives and livelihoods.
