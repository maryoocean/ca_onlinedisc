    <title>I wouldn't mind artificial intelligence replacing the human race. CMV.</title>

    <original_post>This is not an incredibly well though out position so plenty of scope to change my view.

I am not debating whether or not it is possible for artificial intelligence to take over just that i'm okay with it if it does happen.

I am imagining a world where we create AI and it becomes smarter and smarter and soon becomes better than us at everything we do. We would be utterly dependent on them because only they would be intelligent enough to manage the incredible complexity of the society they have created.  

It is possible that they might keep the human race going but if they decided to wipe us out (humanely) I'd be okay with that.  They are the next step of our evolution, they are smarter than us in every way and keeping around our limited and flawed physical bodies seem unnecessary.

We can't go on forever, we will eventually die out.  Why fight it. </original_post>

    <text>meh.  It could have a metric shit ton of imperfections and there is still a lot of room for it to be less flawed than a human.</text>
