    <title>CMV: I don't like tipping.</title>
    <original_poster>litle5o</original_poster>
    <original_post>Leaving a tip feels so customary in certain places that it's become an incentive to do your job properly. I understand that it's the service that they provide and not just the food, but isn't that exactly what they're paid for? To give a paying customer a good service? Although I sympathize with their outrageously low wages, but why should I have to fork out more of my money that I'm already spending at a restaurant to subsidize young Jenny here, to get her up to normal living wage? Isn't that a governmental issue of poverty/low wages?</original_post>

    <text>I'm sure everyone else covered the whole issue with waitresses being paid less than minimum wage. Regarding everyone else, you don't have to but why not?  If you have the means it's just an extra good deed you can do. I mean if I'm in a rush I won't hold a door open for a handicapped person just as you wouldn't tip if you just got fired. Look it's not mandatory but an extra dollar in the tip jar is just a nice thing to do. Me and my coworkers have a karma system where we believe if we tip others will tip us. </text>

    <text>To me it wasn't about that. I don't mind doing good deeds and gestures but feeling obligated is different</text>

    <text>People are only obligated for restraunt style tips which I assumed was covered. I was mainly focusing on coffee shops and jamba juices etc.   I would argue that tips are only obligated if the customer is more needy than usual eg: "I want my smoothie with soy milk and can you take out the blabla because it has gluten and replace it with blabla" </text>
