    <title>I dont think manslaughter or any crime committed accidentally should be considered a crime. At all. CMV</title>

    <original_post>If it is proven that the offender had no intention of committing a crime, why should they be persecuted because the odds were against them? 


EDIT: Ok, many people have used the example of "what if a person is driving drunk and they kill someone?" I still think they should only be punished for driving drunk.</original_post>

    <text>Negligence is an accidental crime, should that not be criminal? The point of making those things criminal isn't because they're accidental, it's because even if it was an accident you're still *responsible*. 

If, for instance, you accidentally kill someone while acting in a negligent way to their safety, the accidental part doesn't minimize the fact that you're still responsible for someones death, and that's why you get charged. </text>
