    <original_post>This is something I've believed for a while. As a species, humans are self-destructive. We procreate too much and consume too many resources. I believe that something like China's one-child policy should be instituted in as many countries as possible to curb population growth. ~~I think currency should be done away with and governments should provide housing and necessities while the population works for the betterment and survival of humanity as a whole rather than for monetary compensation.~~

Am I crazy to think this is how the world should be? 

EDIT: Perhaps eliminating currency would be more problematic than keeping it.</original_post>

    <text>&amp;gt; We procreate too much and consume too many resources.

Birth rates are slowing down. The problem isn't as much that we consume too many resources, it's that we use the resources we inefficiently.

That policy is being overturned because it isn't helping a society in the long run. You end up with too many old people that need to be cared for and not enough you people to care for them.

&amp;gt;  I think currency should be done away with and governments should provide housing and necessities while the population works for the betterment and survival of humanity as a whole rather than for monetary compensation.

This sounds really good on paper, but humans have shown that this doesn't work for large societies. Doing away with currency doesn't work as long as people are still creating value. An abstract medium to represent value (i.e. currency) is more useful than bartering.

Government provided housing and necessities doesn't actually solve anything, unless you're effectively post-scarcity. People prefer choice over these things and the moment a crack appears in the government (housing sucks/isn't maintained, food diminishes/arrives too late, water supply problems...) there will be people to overthrow the system. 

Working towards the survival of humanity works better when there's a profit in it. The moment oil runs dry, you'll see plenty of efficient alternative forms of energy, because the market demands it.</text>
