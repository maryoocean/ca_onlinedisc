    <title>CMV: Capitalism has little to no place in our current world</title>
    <original_poster>s3v3ralmidg3ts</original_poster>
    <original_post>Capitalism was certainly a great boon during the industrial revolution. It spurred the necessary economic development that our worldwide civilization needed to leap into our current state.

That being said, capitalism is doing more harm than good in this era. When things like climate change are significantly tied to corporations, workers being treated as a disposable resource by companies like Amazon, horrendous working conditions being supported by tech companies to mass produce the next iPhone, etc.

Why is capitalism still revered in some circles as the cure all to our problems when that doesn't seem to be the case in practice?</original_post>

    <text>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the arguments about pollution, child labor and other bad things is not necessarily capitalism at fault. It's the company itself. Unless it's because the businesses arent controlled by the state, those conditions were allowed to happen, so in a non capitalistic state, those things woulsnt happen? I dont see how being a socialistic state would 100%prevent any of that.</text>
