    <title>CMV: Wine glasses are impractical, inconvenient, and should not be used for the purposes of drinking when more convenient glasses/cups are available.</title>

    <original_post>Wine glasses are incredibly impractical and inconvenient tools for the purposes of drinking. First, they are tall and top heavy. This makes them easier to knock over and spill than ordinary glasses. While their wider base alleviates this a bit, they have the additional problem of being very easy to break, so that if they do fall over, there is a good chance that they will shatter, leaving a mess that is difficult and potentially harmful to clean. On the subject of cleaning, their shape makes them difficult to clean and their fragility makes them difficult to clean well. You cannot get your hand inside them to apply pressure to certain stains, and even if you could, you still can't apply the pressure needed to clean some stains without risking breaking the glass. Furthermore, the stem of the glass is also brittle and serves no practical purpose. For these reasons, wine glasses should not be used or be expected to be used.

    <text>Since you think body-temperature wine generally tastes good I can't imagine this will affect your opinion, but for completeness:

1. Wine is often (but not always) meant to "breathe". That is to say, the amount of oxygen dissolved in the liquid affects the flavor a lot. With soft drinks, you start the drink fizzed and then keep it either in a small container (a single serving can) or a resealable bottle/keg/etc. With water you don't bother to save it, but you do generally throw out a glass of water after an hour because the "stale" taste - dissolved gasses. --- With wine, breathing is desirable and you are meant to slosh your wine around in the glass before drinking it. Many expensive wines are completely indistinguishable from Yellowtail until you do this. Aerators which attach to the bottle are getting more popular, and make swirling less necessary, but you still need a wider glass with a narrow top to do this.

2. Wine is pretty. People like to look at it from below. The curvature and rims of normal glasses make it hard to see. It's no different from wanting to observe any other piece of food.

3. Glasses are proportioned to serving sizes. A pint mug is a good size for serving beer because people often drink a pint as a serving. A shot glass, a cocktail glass, a tumbler, ditto. People drink normal drinks out of a 1-2 cup glass or mug. While you could get some sort of efficiency out of drinking everything out of a Dixie cup, if you are going to have sixteen spices and three kinds of bowls, why not have a specific serving size for each drink? The only glass I cannot defend is the martini glass; obviously you need a stem (warm gin/vodka is foul) but why the odd shallow shape?

4. At large dinners where platters are being moved and served, the platter is often passing at a height between that of the wine glass and that of the water glass. It's very common to spill food into someone's water glass (which is harmless), but rare to spill it into the wine glass (which could potentially be an expensive waste).

5. Flutes are the most painful glasses to wash, but they produce he most surface area, which is necessary to produce bubbles from sparkling wines like champagne or prosecco. The bubbles only appear where the liquid encounters some texture that can serve as a nucleus for the effervescence.</text>
