    <title>CMV: Average men do not have a good chance of having sex with women.</title>
    <original_poster>fitness35754745</original_poster>
    <original_post>My lady friends husband has had a threesome before and they are looking into being able to do it again.

This guy is 6 foot 3.

For me I'm only average sized. 5 foot 9 which an average penis of 5.5 inches length and 4.8 inches girth. My looks are also average only too I would say. However I would say my personality is good towards friends, I've managed to get my lady friend to open up to me about talking about her sexual experiences so I must be doing something right. (No flirting just friends talking, I'm lucky to have a friend like her)

I'm super insecure about this and this has kept me from sleeping. I'm not exsactly worried about having threesomes or often sex, I just feel quite inferior for not.

Do average guys really have a chance with this type of thing? I cant help but feel this guys height (and possible above average penis size) is making women consider sleeping with him more. Do I have atleast a good chance? I believe I dont and that I'm at a very big disadvantage. 

I know from fair studies that the preferred penis size is bigger than average and I'm sure the preferred height for a man is above average too. I'm more worried about penis size because well, it can change the plessure the women recieves no matter good or bad.</original_post>

    <text>Can you really not say that most of the 25+ year old average guys in your life aren’t in relationships? I just don’t see how anyone could think what you claim is true. Once you get over your teenage insecurities about not being perfect, ladies will show interest left and right.</text>

    <text>And let's not pretend that teenage girls don't grow up, too.  They get over their insecurities and start to prioritize other things outside of looks, (just like guys do).

Not saying that looks aren't still important, but the grading scale changes from a "1 to 10" to a simple "pass/fail", for both girls and guys, when it comes to dating at least.</text>
