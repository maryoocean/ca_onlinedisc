    <title>CMV: I don't believe in punishment.</title>
    <original_poster>meur123</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't believe in punishment. I believe it's petty. I believe it does no good and only harm. As the old saying goes: "An eye for an eye makes the world blind." What does punishment actually achieve? If you kill somebody who killed somebody, it doesn't in any way bring them back. 

Look, I believe that we should have prisons, but not for punishment. The only reason to take away somebodies freedom is to prevent further harm to society. What has already been done is done. Prisons should focus instead on rehabilitation. If somebody is likely to cause harm to another, then it is necessary we take the means to prevent that. If they do not pose a danger, then it achieves nothing to take away their freedom.

**EDIT:** [I awarded a delta to someone that challenged the arguments of this final paragraph.](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/49fioa/cmv_i_dont_believe_in_punishment/d0regc3)

&amp;gt;Before you mention deterrence, I agree that we should aim to cut the problem out before it happens. Where I don't agree is that fear is an effective motivator. A much better solution would be to eliminate the conditions that coerce people into turning to crime.

Talking about deterrence was really tangential to the argument that I was actually making, and I was wrong to say that it is not in any way an effective tool.

But CMV, does punishment achieve anything for the greater good?

    <text>If you incarcerate someone against their will, even if it is to quarantine them or rehabilitate them instead of just to see them suffer, it is still punishment. Prisons are institutions of punishment as long as people don't *choose* to go there. Firstly, do be able to exercise this sort of authority demonstrates a power difference, and given that it is against their will and in response to their actions, it still constitutes a punishment.

Even if you sentence a person to mandatory community service, it is a punishment. A fine is a punishment. Even a public denunciation is a mild punishment.

In short, it sounds like you *do* believe in punishments. Just not *all* punishments.</text>

    <text>These two definitions speak for themselves.

Punishment: "the infliction or imposition of a penalty as **retribution** for an offence."

Retribution: "punishment inflicted on someone as **vengeance** for a wrong or criminal act."

    <text>We can list definitions till we're blue in the face. For instance, in psychology, a punishment is anything added or taken away in order to dissuade the same action in the future.

I think that if you are using authority to enforce detention upon a person for whatever reason, you need to question why. If a person assaults you and you hit them back, I can see that as self-defence. If they assault you and you sue them for damages, that is restorative justice. But if you wait a little and then throw them in a prison cell, how is that option going to come off as anything except punishment? No one is *forcing* you to press charges and send them to jail.

Think of it this way: forcing a person to undergo rehabilitation against their will is a form of retribution.</text>

    <text>Is it though? It's not revenge. Sure, nobody is forcing you to press charges but it also keeps you and your neighbors a lot safer.

Let's go back to self defense. If someone hits you, and you hit them back, that's self defense. If you gain the upper hand, get them to a point in which they are no longer a threat to you, and continue beating them to a bloody pulp, then that is punishment.</text>

    <text>Is that how you punish a child, too? By going right to the extreme for no reason? I think you're thinking of revenge and using the word punishment in it's place.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment

&amp;gt; Punishment is the authoritative imposition of an undesirable or unpleasant outcome upon a group or individual, in response to a particular action or behaviour that is deemed unacceptable or threatening to some norm.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment_(psychology)

&amp;gt; In operant conditioning, punishment is any change in a human or animal's surroundings that occurs after a given behavior or response which reduces the likelihood of that behavior occurring again in the future.</text>
