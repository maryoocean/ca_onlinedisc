    <title>CMV: There is no position on either side of the US immigration policy debate that makes any damn sense.</title>

    <original_post>Sure, the extremists in most debates don’t make sense, that’s normal. In this case, extreme conservatives want mass deportations of all illegal aliens, and extreme liberals want wide open borders where all are welcomed without limit. Either extreme seems clear it would be a disaster.

But what would a reasonable moderate (or slightly liberal) position be? I can’t think of one! Here’s how I currently interpret our balance:

* yes, we need at least some border security, we can’t just let people slip past the border checkpoints whenever they want.

* however, if you do successfully sneak past our border security, congratulations, you made it! We don’t like to deport people once they start setting down roots, so welcome aboard!

* therefore, we should have moderate border security that stops some people, but we will sort of look the other way sometimes too.

Letting people stay based on how successfully and for how long they evade the law seems like nonsense to me, but I can’t think of a better way. Is there one?</original_post>

    <text>Countries should strive to be as homogeneous as possible, it is in a country's best interest to keep as many people as possible with the same ethnic makeup, the same language, same religion, etc. 

Diversity welcomes conflict, a diverse nation is one where there ends up being a breaking point, a conflict point between two incompatible world views where neither side can be happy without the other side being unhappy. 

An easy example of this would be infant circumcision, if you're a Jew you view it as essential to your religion, however, for many others its a barbaric practice that's child abuse. You cannot have it both ways (after all, if you believe it is child abuse you would never allow a religious exception for child abuse) one side must triumph over the other. Instead it is best that those who are similar stick together, this will minimize the amount of conflict and lead to happier, more prosperous, societies. 

Because of this, the focus should not be for or against legal or illegal immigration, the focus should be on Mexican (or other south/central american countries) immigration to the US because legal or illegal, they still decrease the homogeneity of the nation. </text>
