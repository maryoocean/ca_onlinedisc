    <title>CMV:Segregated ( by gender) workplaces would lead to improved productivity.</title>
    <original_poster>hastyanon</original_poster>
    <original_post>I created this throwaway as I know this is a controversial and sexist opinion but it is one I have built up after 15 years of working in various environments. I would love someone to show me how I am wrong on this (preferably with some research to back it up) but in my experience, male-only (or almost male-only) work environments have been more on-task, have fewer issues of bitchyness and non-work related office disagreements, and generally more professionalism. I have worked in software development where teams/departments have frequently been 99% men and also worked in other office environments with a more equal mix. I see office politics in both situations but in offices with a greater number of women I have noticed a significantly greater quantity of personal issues becoming involved (relationships/friendships/personal disagreements etc). These frequently affect staff turnover and productivity. I can't comment on female-only environments as I have never worked in one, but would love to hear from those that have. I don't think women are any different to men in terms of productivity but from what I have seen the combination of men and women at work in an office is less than ideal. I'm looking forward to hearing your arguments and opinions. Please help me to change my view!

    <text>To counter your personal anecdote, I have worked in mixed environments and 95% female environments (as a woman). I can't say I have encountered more "bitchyness" (which is a sexist, loaded term, btw) in the predominantly woman environments. I think a lot of at-work unpleasantness has to do with individual personalities more so than gender. Also agree with other commentators that this seems to be an issue of confirmation bias.

    <text>As a male that works in an otherwise entirely female office - seriously, I'm outnumbered like fifty to one - I'm right there with you.  The level of politicking is no higher than any other place I've worked and, while it does seem to get handled differently (the conflicts tend to be less directly confrontational and more addressed by building consensus behind the scenes like a big quietly verbal rugby scrum - and, of course, this may have less to do with male-female differences and more with the office culture) the end result is the same: the job gets done.  I actually find myself enjoying the all-female-but-me work environment more than the male dominated environments I've worked in the past, but then I've always generally gotten along better with women than men to begin with.</text>

    <text>And for young people I think it's even better.  Last year in APUSH, my class only had three girls in it for some reason.  Coincidence with the scheduling I suppose.  Anyway, I was never made to feel like I was less than anyone because of my sex.  The only time one of those guys made fun of me was in a different class that had an equal ratio, so it wasn't singling me out or anything and in the context and tone it was obvious he didn't mean it.  

So yeah, it's possible for teenagers to work together when one gender greatly outnumbers the other.  I'm sure adults can manage working with the opposite sex.</text>
