    <title>CMV: the way that conservatives have got in line behind Trump shows that they never really believed in anything in the first place, apart from belonging to a tribe and beating the other tribe.</title>
    <original_poster>Kavafy</original_poster>
    <original_post>As things stand, Trump has already been chosen as a presidential candidate once and is massively in the lead to be chosen again. Yet he seems to go against traditional conservative values in so many respects. 

* Family values: he's a known adulterer, "grab 'em by the pussy" etc.
* Religion: clownishly ignorant about the Bible
* Managerial competence: ignorant of basic facts about world and US affairs
* Honest dealing: on his own admission he's exploited bankruptcy rules several times to get out of debts. And where are the tax returns?
* Promises kept: where's the money from Mexico for the wall? Where's the "beautiful" healthcare plan that we were promised?
* Decorum: I don't think I need to say much about this one. Belittling, name-calling, tantrums, the list goes on.
* Democracy: "if I lose then it was rigged". This is probably the biggest of them all. 

I understand that some conservatives have distanced themselves. But the majority of the GOP seems to be behind him. What explains this, except for wanting to feel like you're in the in-group, and wanting to own the stupid libs?</original_post>

    <text>If you don't agree with my view then try and change it. Just posting "herp deep you're wrong" isn't going to accomplish anything. Call Franc</text>

    <text>No, I mean it makes no sense. 

For instance, "CMV: Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election because her supporters never really believed in anything in the first place, apart from belonging to a tribe and beating the other tribe", how would you dispute that?</text>

    <text>There's no argument there. It's just an assertion. If you want to argue against what I've said then you'll have to do better than just saying it doesn't make sense. By this point you have committed repeated violations of Rule 5 so I don't think this sub is for you.</text>
