    <title>CMV: Straight white males mostly children will think negatively of themselves in the future and we should try to combat it sooner than later.</title>

    <original_post>Let me begin with a few things

1. this isn't me looking or justifying the start of any kind of white, straight, or male pride day

2. this isnt me trying to cancel any pride day or month

3. please dont try to convince me of why your pride day or month is important or needed. I understand them and why they were created, etc.

I think that's it for the beginning. I just want to make it clear im not attacking any of that.

As prides and celebrations start to grow and become for celebrated I can't help but feel like it will become a problem for straight white males in the future. Not only is it the only group of people left out of this (which again I dont want it) its more about what you are told when you ask why it isn't. If you ask why being white isnt celebrated (its racist), straight (homophobic), male (misogynistic). So i think in time as kids start to ask why they have nothing like that and are told why they will automatically start seeing themselves as racist, homophobic, misogynists through no fault of their own and will then have a negative image of themselves.</original_post>

    <text>You have to look a little a the history here.

I'm 36 which isn't that old.  When I was a kid the prevailing attitude among society was that being gay was weird.  It was maybe a mental illness.  It was immoral.  It was bad.  If you were gay you were a freak who should be ashamed of yourself.

So a bunch of gay people got together and said that's bullshit.  What is the opposite of shame?  Pride.  We are proud of being gay.  We are going to celebrate who we are.  We are going to be proud of ourself.

Straight people on the other hand, have never been shamed.   we have no negative stigma that we need to battle against.

I think you probably will see pride months fall away, and it might evolve into something more like saint Patrick's day where Irish and non-Irish (or gays and non-gays) celebrate and party together.  As gay people increasing have no negative stigmas to battle against, it will just evolve into an excuse for everyone to party and have fun.  And that will happen long before straight people have anything to feel ashamed about.</text>
