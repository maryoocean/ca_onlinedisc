    <title>CMV: Pride parades should have less NSFW content</title>
    <original_poster>punmaster29</original_poster>
    <original_post>To preface, I'm bisexual and I love pride month and pride parades. However, I think that the amount of inappropriate content impedes some of the intent behind pride. 

To me, pride is about celebrating the LGBT+ community and promoting acceptance and understanding. It's about not being ashamed of who we love and what we identify as, and being able to share that with the world. 

I think the parade would ideally be a great place to bring our families, to show parents and children how incredible and talented the community is. I'm not out to my family, but bringing them to Pride would be a great start towards warming them up to accept me. But generally given the amount of public nudity and sexual inappropriateness at Pride, this is pretty much out of the question. 

In order to be more inclusive and celebrate love with as many people as possible, I think pride parades should tone down the sexual undertones and focus more on the concepts of love, pride, celebration, and acceptance. </original_post>

    <text>Pride was never really about appealing to cishets, promoting acceptance, or promoting understanding. It's an anniversary celebration of the Stonewall riots and as you said a celebration of being lgbtq. It's about saying 'fuck you for trying to make me feel lesser, I'm proud of who I am.' PDA serves that goal very well.

It's about telling the world that we are here and we aren't going away, we aren't going to hide our affection and love like they want us to, we aren't going to conform to their norms even when they try to force us. We are who we are and goddamnit we are proud. 

There are plenty of places families and children can go to see the talent of the lgbtq community. But pride is not, and should not ever, be about anyone outside of our community. They're welcome to come celebrate with us, but it's not about them. It's about us.</text>
