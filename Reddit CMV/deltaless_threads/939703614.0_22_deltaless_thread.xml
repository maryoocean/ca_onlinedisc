    <title>CMV: Where your born doesn't matter and country pride is pointless</title>
    <original_poster>Blank-VII</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't think I belong to a country and I think the concept is odd. I was born in the UK and have lived here all my life, but I fail to understand why people are so hard-core about being a 'proud brit' or anything. Where I was born isn't something I was able to decide for myself, and I want my life to be what I make out of it, not what it decides for me. I believe the only way to belong to a country is to find one whose culture is similar to your own tastes and opinions, and to move there. What's the point in being proud of a country I was born in if I feel no attachment to how it's run or anything else?

*you're

*View partially changed. Country pride is not pointless.

**Main view unchanged, it seems no-one can quite convince me. I've had some fantastic conversations and I'm really happy with how many of you engaged without being toxic. Stay safe y'all. Thanks so much!**</original_post>

    <text>Where you’re born absolutely matters because it’s will determine the ways in which you are able to connect with other humans. 

I don’t know about your travel experiences, but I am an American who went and studied abroad in Shanghai, China to learn Chinese and do something different. 

Who did I become friends with when I was alone out there? Other Americans, Australians, Brits, Germans, other Western Europeans. Do you know why? Language. If I couldn’t communicate the way that I wanted to, I was reduced down to basic communication that didn’t let me fully express myself and be understood. 

My best friend while I was there was a black dude from North Carolina. I’m a white dude from California. If we met in the US, we might not have become as close of friends because we would have had less in common. But in China, we had so much in common and we were able to realize we had even more in common and we became super close. He was the only guy who I could watch movies, comedies, music, etc and we understood each other without needing to say much. 

You don’t realize how nuanced culture is until you watch comedies with a group of international people. The amount of times my buddy &amp;amp; I would be hanging with our group of international friends watching a movie or something, and we would just start busting up laughing or make a connection and we would realize there were blank stares and we would have to explain it. But in those moments when we were both laughing - it’s a comfort. We understood each other and could share in the moment. 

That’s what culture is - it’s simply understanding. And if you ever live somewhere where you are not part of the larger culture, it can be a very lonely place. But geography exposes you to specific types of people, and that exposure helps you relate to others, have shared values, shared traditions, shared jokes, shared history. Culture bonds us and national identity shapes that culture.</text>
