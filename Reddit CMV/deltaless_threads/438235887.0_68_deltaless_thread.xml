    <title>CMV: If gender is a social construct, then so is race</title>
    <original_poster>BoppeBoye</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let us take, as a given, that gender is divorced from the circumstances of your birth, that it is not a mental illness, and that there is no biological basis for what gender identity someone should express. Have I phrased that effectively? I'm trying to be concise, but I want to portray that premise correctly.

Why, then, should race be different than gender? If race carries with it "shared experience" and "lived experience", etc - that assumes that the only way you could understand what it's like to be a minority is to have lived your entire life as that particular minority. I'm not arguing against that, I agree that there are certain experiences that I could not comprehend - for instance, overbearing &amp;amp; strict Asian parents with exceedingly high expectations. 

But, if someone can change their gender or decide (?) that they identify as a different gender without having the prior lived experience of said gender, then why can't someone identify as a different race?

I'm not able to encompass all the variables which could lead someone to identify as another gender, but is it not possible for someone to come to the same conclusion with their race? What if an Indian man grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood, saw or experienced the same (or similar) discrimination as them, had minimal exposure to Indian culture; and this led him to conclude that he identifies more closely as a black man, rather than Indian? 

I would also like to cite Rachel Dolezal, who was uniformly mocked for being (afaik) the first trans-black woman in the public eye. It seems similar to transgender discrimination to me, assuming that there is something wrong with her mentally for deciding to become a black woman... Anyway, I'm not really defending her because that's not really in line with what I described in the previous paragraph (she grew up privileged IIRC), but the public reaction of mockery goes against the leftist belief of acceptance, by my perspective.

So, in short, why can there be no such thing as trans-racial people, the same way there are transgender?

    <text>I get annoyed by the constant dilution of meaning in order to make everyone feel like they can be categorised as who they want and not how they are. 

We want to assign labels subjectively rather than objectively. 

If you are biologically a male, then you are a male. 
If you are biologically a female then you are a female. 
If for some biological reason your physical gender is somewhere between then I understand you being categorised as such. 

But if you are a male that feels like a woman or wants to be a woman then you are still a male. 
The want to redefine and break the meaning of a definition so that you can identify with that definition is meaningless. 

If I want to call red things blue, then I suppose I could but the red things are still red. 

Playing with the words does not change the reality of an object. 

I may seem like a prick saying this but for me the idea of redefining things to fit your world view is a just lying to yourself regardless if your intentions. 

Ideally we would deal with this issue in one of two very different ways. 

1) We realising that trying to label the complexity that is the human experience with a handful of binary labels is a gross oversimplification and is like saying from now on we are going to categorise all colours as either brown or mauve. 
The labels just do not accurately define the reality. 
So instead of trying to fit everyone into two labels just add more dimensions to the descriptive language. 

Or 

1) We stop spending so much time defining and labelling ourselves and treat everyone as individuals. 
We acknowledge that even it we come up with hundreds of categories we are still going to be shoehorning people into boxes that they donâ€™t fit purely for our need to make sure each person is in there right box. 

Sorry for babbling, I am just  a computer guy that probably needs to be sleeping rather than rightly random streams of conscienceness on reddit.
