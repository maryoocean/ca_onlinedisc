    <title>CMV: Adding rape as a legal punishment would be good for society.</title>
    <original_poster>kimagical</original_poster>
    <original_post>This started off as a showerthought but I couldn't find any reason this isn't legit, so here we go.

We need to add rape to the legal system as a viable additional punishment for heinous crimes.

I know what you're thinking. But it's not an unsually cruel punishment.

We already have the death sentence, and if not that, then life sentences of solitary confinement, which virtually all experts-- including official statements from the United Nations-- agree is torture.

And if you're a prisoner today, sometimes you are *already* getting raped. Other times you go "gay for the stay".

So don't tell me adding rape as a legal punishment is anything unusually cruel or sinking lower morally.

If anything, this would help guards regulate "safer" condom-provided prison rape, like how weed became regulated and safer after it was legalized in Canada.

So it's not much of a negative. But why is it a positive?

Here's why: there's a rapidly rising population of involuntary celibates. In the last 10 years alone, the population of these "incels" doubled from 12% of the young male population to 24%.

This is 45,000 incels ballooning to over 100,000. These incels have been behind an alarming number of mass murder sprees.

Every day incels on the dark web discuss organizing terrorism.

There's no fancy peer-reviewed study on that last bit yet-- but I've seen this happening with my own eyes by digging around social media years ago.

I found massive and highly active online communities who worship Elliot Roger and egg each other on to muster up the courage to flatten people with trucks. Buy automatic weapons and kill.

If the population is given free license on their own time to rape any inmates who have been handed the punishment of rape, this could solve some of the incel problem.

It *may* not help; obviously there's no proof in this area. It would be a moral wild west, but there's no time to wait. Innocent people are being shot to death.

It would be far more immoral to not at least try this preventative measure when there are innocents being murdered.

This availability of prison sex slaves with no bodily rights would also directly compete with street prostitution, lowering the demand for a dangerous and morally questionable industry, at best saving two birds with one nest.

At worst, we realize it's not helping and we revert the program. My view is that there is enough reason to try it.</original_post>

    <text>If this was implemented to your exact specifications, but was monitored closely in order to  determine it's impact on society, would you reverse your opinion if the data proved that the new policy was harmful to society?</text>

    <text>There is data (I can look it up if you would like, but I'm fairly confident on this point) that shows that any form of punitive justice (that being justice for crimes that has a focus on punishment as a higher priority than rehabilitation) has a negative impact on society. If anything, I think that your proposal is more severe, and would have harsher social consequences than other current forms of punitive justice as a result.</text>

    <text>Alright, if you can show me that making punishment harsher makes society worse that would change my view to think adding rape as a punishment might be more negative than I thought.</text>

    <text>This first link is to an article giving an overview on the idea that punitive justice does long-term social harm.

This next article is much longer than the first, but provides a more thorough look at the issues, and has more extensive sources and citations for it's arguments.

This last link is to a Youtube video essay by Contrapoints that I personally found to be informative and persuasive on the general topic of justice. This is what initially convinced me of my current stance on criminal justice, but I can't say that you will find it as relevant or persuasive as I did.
