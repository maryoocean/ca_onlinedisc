    <title>CMV: Redditors don't know shit about money</title>
    <original_poster>Yaqoob_</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have asked on multiple sub-reddits about the way money works. Its inception, supply, centralisation among other constituents. Most of the redditors answer in jargon language which doesn't serve any use. Divulging a bit, I have also hear that reddit doesn't turn a profit because the audience of reddit are merely keyboard warriors who don't have money to go out there and spend for advertisers to generate cashflow.

Also, kindly do suggest how I can understand things related to money (in simple language)</original_post>

    <text>In reality is very simple.

Money is printed from Central banks (Bce in Europe and Fed in Usa) and borrowed to the country in exchange of an interest, which is called public debt.

Issuing money can be a stimulus in the short term, but can rise inflation in the long term.

Part of your taxes get used every year to pay part of the national debt, which obviously can never be repaid in full, as the money to pay interest simply does not exist.

Therefor our economy is based on debt.

If you sum all the debts of each country vs another you should get 0, as you might believe that for every dollar of credit there is a dollar of debit.

This is wrong. If you sum all the national debts of each country in the world, the debt is something like 100 trillions.

We own that money to central banks, which are private and not public.</text>
