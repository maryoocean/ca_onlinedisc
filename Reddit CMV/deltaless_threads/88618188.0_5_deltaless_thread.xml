    <title>I believe young people can't get jobs because the present workforce is dominated by the older generation. CMV</title>

    <original_post>I believe this because over the past few weeks I've been surveying this idea, and I've noticed some things. If you ever get on the road, anytime before 6, 7, or 8 p.m., etc. (quitting time), you'll notice that most everyone in their cars are older people. Rarely do you see teenagers in them, and if you do, they have friends in there, so you'd have to assume that they're going out to have fun, and not to work. 

Whenever I've had a job, I'm always surrounded by people in their 30's, 40's, and sometimes even older than that. 

So the question I would have after all this, is: Do teens have any business looking for employment at their age? Even after they leave college, you still hear about them having a tough time finding work. So where does the problem lie? How can we fix this?

The newer, younger generation is growing up, and soon we'll take over. How soon? Not soon enough...

    <text>I'm 16 and I've been looking for a job for close to six months now. In my area of the US, it's mainly because of an overall lack of jobs. Also, many employers tend to pick older applicants because most usually have more work experience than someone my age. Also, older workers tend to have a family to feed while teenage workers are only usually looking for gas money and some money to blow (this is not always the case.) 

Also, I've applied to several places where laws force age restrictions on workers. For example, Goodwill won't hire anyone under the age of 18. Almost any job working around machinery or sharp objects won't allow anyone under 18 to even apply. 

This just comes from personal experience, I'm certainly no master on the subject. I hope it cleared a few things up for you. </text>
