    <title>CMV: I don't understand why everyone loves Wonder Woman</title>
    <original_poster>LilYonsan</original_poster>
    <original_post>Could someone help a cis-gendered white male understand why critics and people alike are raving about the new Wonder Woman movie? Having seen the movie myself, I really just don't understand what all the hype is about and when I think about this movie I seem to think about three main points that I just can't get around: the movie felt formulaic, the music was sub-par and predictable, and finally the movie's role in relation to my current ideas of gender.

**Wonder Woman felt formulaic:** 
This is one of my main criticisms of the movie, and I think it has come from the movie market being over-saturated with superhero movies as of late. Other than the first two batman movies (and maybe the third), I laugh at the relative quality of DC's live-action movies compared to their Animated Universe counterpart. Wonder Woman does what every other superhero movie has already done, the only difference was that it was a female lead (which I'll get more into later), my complaint was the result to me felt uninspired and the execution of the scenes was unoriginal (When viewing many of the fight scenes in this movie, I was reminded of 300)

**The Music Felt Bland:**
As a musician myself, I feel the music also played a large role in my lack of interest. I'd like to start off this point but suggesting readers watch this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vfqkvwW2fs) to get a better understanding of where I'm coming from on this point. You don't have to, but it might help. If not, basically the point of the video is that, due to many factors, the music in movies and what composers are actually allowed to compose has been limited, resulting in a more neutral and uninspired soundtrack as a whole. There are only two sections in the movie featuring a cello playing a leading-tone into a tonic with loud drums behind it that stood out, and honestly I think the only reason it stood out was because they turned the music up slightly louder than they did the sound effects. 

**With regard to Gender:**

Which brings me to the point of this movie that I'm really trying to wrap my head around. "Maybe", I thought, "that is the point. That it's just like all of the superhero movies that feature men, but shows that a woman can do it just as well". Before I go on this topic, I'm glad to see more movies that feature female leads (this and ghostbusters I think do some good in a societal level, especially given some of the political turmoil this country has been in as of late), but if that is the entire point then, like my other complaints, movies like Kill Bill and Alien did it better because they weren't so preachy about it. To me, Wonder Woman took the approach "she does this despite the fact that she's a woman because she's powerful, rooooaaaar!!", whereas Ripley in Alien and **bleep** in Kill Bill were just badasses because they were and that was the end of discussion. 

In summary, it's not that I thought that Wonder Woman was a terrible movie, but I don't think it deserves nearly the praise and hype that it received, and I felt like I could have spent the time watching that movie doing something more meaningful. But, as I mentioned at the beginning of this topic, I'm a guy, so maybe I'm just not getting something here. Please, change my view reddit because I would really like to understand better what I don't already! 

Thanks for reading!

    <text>I see that different parts of your view have already been challenged, so I will direct you to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5vQz4Xz6q8) talking about the music in WW and BvS.

I'll admit, this single song "Is She With You?" coupled with her end scene in BvS is one of the most significant reasons I was excited about WW.

BvS was whatever, but I loved that song. I loved what Hanz Zimmer did with it, I loved the deep spooky cello as played [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI2ASp0f7GU). It sounds exotic, powerful, ominous, etc all at the same time. The buildup of drums sends you towards a musical climax that then gets built and released through the dissonance described in the video.

Also, it's extremely different to other superhero themes. Yea part of the scene uses big orchestral numbers that rise and fall and your emotions are supposed to ride along blah blah. That is the sort of orchestral score that *doesn't* work for me as much, since the upbeat violins signaling the protagonist's impending victory are really boring and played out.

But seeing an uncommon hero (powerful super-woman on screen) coupled with this radical, dissonant electric cello makes you so excited about what she can do. Can she fly? Can she survive heat vision? Can her sword hurt Doomsday? I don't know but this music makes me think she's about to rip him in half, so I'm excited to see what happens.

That's at least how I felt about the music, and hopefully that explanation video can give you some appreciation on the thought that goes behind both her established theme in BvS, and here nascent, early theme in WW.</text>
