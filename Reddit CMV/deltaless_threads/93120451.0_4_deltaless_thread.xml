    <title>PC gameplay hasn't really evolved in any significant way for a decade. CMV</title>

    <original_post>Aside from graphics i can't think of a game that has broken as much ground as games did around the dawn of the millennia.

TBS: Heroes V may have had 3d graphics but the gameplay mechanics are the exact same as in H3 with only minor changes such as heroes taking a minor role on combat. If anything the graphics just slow down and distract.

RTS: Quick! Point out a fundamental difference between Warcraft 3 and Starcraft 2! They both have 3d graphics, same types of units and highly customized map editors. Difference is that there are 8 years between those games. If you were playing custom games in wc3 on Bnet you definately remember the crazy diversity the game offered.

1PS: Quake 3 had special items, multiplayer, different weapons, different missiles, armor and 3d. Physics engine? The characters jump up and fall down. If they fall down hard on the ground they take damage. If they fall in the water they don't. There's your physics engine. Portal is something of a challenger but it lacks multiplayer which imo makes it a bit of a novelty for people looking for a new PC gaming experience while only having one mission that you can't share with anyone.

MMORPG: World of Warcraft....has been going on now for 1 year short of a decade and there's no end in sight so i count it also.

So am i missing something or have they simply stopped making groundbreaking games?</original_post>

    <text>Look! This sequel and this sequel are the same! QED

Did you just disregard every major indie game that's come about now that digital distribution systems are popular? You're trivializing every major advance in order to "prove" your point when if you look even slightly deeper than the most blanket statements about these genres you would see how false that is.

TBS Heroes 6 contains plenty of new features that change your tactics and focuses on the hero more than previous games.

RTS: The support for competition such as an extremely complex matchmaking system such that you are always facing similarly skilled opponents.

FPS: there is a huge difference between what you called a "Physics engine" and what actually counts as a physics engine.

MMO: Newer MMOs have been innovating (guild wars) but the base users won't migrate. Even the current WOW is completely different to how it originally ran.</text>
