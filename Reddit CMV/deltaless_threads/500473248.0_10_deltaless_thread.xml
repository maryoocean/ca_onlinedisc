    <title>CMV: There is no such thing as "love at first sight"</title>

    <original_post>So-called love at first sight is based on just that - sight. 
&amp;amp;nbsp;

Now I know some people are going to jump in with anecdotes about grandparents who married after three dates and were together for 70 years and whatnot. But that is a form of commitment and usually (in older people) a response to a society that did not really allow for divorce. Can two people make it work if they fall in love based on sight and quickly marry? Sure, sometimes. But that doesn't mean that real love, deep love like you have when you know all parts of a person can form immediately upon seeing them. You can't truly love someone without knowing about their personality, their thoughts and their feelings.</original_post>

    <text>Biologically, love is a complex set of patterns that trigger our biological reward system as they move us closer to our primary function, to reproduce.

Upon our initial contact with any member of our species, we will immediately asses them to see how they fit into that imperative.    This evaluation, more often than not, begins visually. 

Therefore, Biologically, love at first sight does exist, it is just entirely possible that we will later accumulate more data which makes a given individual less ideal for procreation.</text>
