    <title>CMV: Kink and BDSM should not be at public pride events and should be kept for 18+ ones</title>

    <original_post>To start, I am a lesbian. And I've been seeing recent controversy about this topic. 

Look, no denying that kink plays a big role in the creation of pride. It is a part of embracing sexuality and shouldn't be excluded from the community. 

However, it should not be at public pride parades. Pride should be for everyone of all ages. Many people say "stop catering to the straight capitalized ideal of what pride should be" and "pride isn't a party, it's a protest don't police us" and "children should go to disney if they want family friendly" This has nothing to do with straight rainbow capitalism. I figured out I was LGBT at age 11 and trust me if I saw a kink act in public I would be kind of disgusted. I'm still a minor now, and I'd be less disgusted but still. I know people say that it's up to you to bring your children to pride, but by making all pride events "wear whatever you want even if it's nothing" we are also kinda excluding minors from it. It's also non consensual to anyone who is exposed to such acts, because nobody wants to go to pride to see naked people right? The "think of the children" phrase holds true here. Young children and teens embracing their sexuality shouldn't be forced to see adult acts against their will. 

Again, no denying the role kink plays in the community, but it should be kept at 18+ events. There should definitely be a separate pride for people who just want to do leather and other kinks. That way, you can do whatever you want in a safe space where you know you won't offend others, and because people consented to come to an 18+ event, it's all good. 

That's just my personal opinion on it, but it seems to be the minority. I'd like to see how you guys think about this.

Edit: it appears after reading and responding to several comments, I don't really have a problem with kink, but more with public indecency. I don't care if you wear a collar or leather pants. But I'd rather not see things that could get you arrested or questioned for doing in public.</original_post>

    <text>I’ll try to play devil’s advocate. Pardon me if it’s not very good. 

We younger generations, particularly in places where they would even hold pride parades without backlash, didn’t experience the worst of it. We’re not being killed, we got same-sex marriage passed nationwide, we have the internet to find accepting people who’d even go as far as to shelter those of us who come from homes where the religion teaches hate. 

So what’s left? First it was coming out of the closet, now it’s taking everything else out too. If we’re free to be who we are sexually, that should mean every part of it. 

We’ve got ass-shaking videos and hot tub streams being watched by millions of pubescents and prepubescents anyway. Fetish gear isn’t even more revealing. 

If we keep normalizing sexuality and do so safely, we can prevent a lot of the emotional damage that comes with hiding any part of who you are. And the physical damage from trying something incorrectly. This may be a stretch, but it’s like providing condoms instead of preaching abstinence. With kinks normalized, teens can learn how to do weird shit safely instead of, say, a girl shoving a 14” homemade dildo made of socks and duct tape up herself because it’s all she had and the only easily accessible depictions of sex involve monster dongs and dragon dildos so she expects to be able to take it. (A girlfriend of mine) 

Making such things adult-only would have the same effect as with drugs and alcohol and vanilla sex. They’ll still do it, just not safely.</text>
