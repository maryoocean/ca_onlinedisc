    <title>CMV: Giving other cultures sh*t about eating dog meat is hypocritical</title>
    <original_poster>simobk</original_poster>
    <original_post>Hi all,

So someone just posted a video on my FB feed about [the Yulin dog meat festival](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=yulin+dog+meat+festival). It is horrifying...

For the purpose of this CMV, let's forget about how it's done (the way they get the dogs, they treat them... etc.) and concentrate **only** on the dog meat eating part.

I love dogs, and yes, I find it horrifying that other cultures eat them. However, I also understand that for other cultures, it is horrifying to see us eat beef or pork.

In my opinion, the only situation where you are allowed to complain is if you are talking about eating animal meat in general. But if you enjoy eating a good steak, then it is hypocritical to criticize others for eating what they consider is "just meat".

Again, I am stressing the fact that this is not about the *animal cruelty* part. It's just about the meat eating. For the sake of this CMV, let's suppose that the animals are bred and slaughtered in the most humane possible way.

So... CMV

    <text>Taking a more general look at it, I do not believe it is hypocritical at all to criticise someone else's meat choice when you yourself eat meat. For example, I would be critical of a person or culture that farmed and ate Chimpanzees, but not chickens. This is because I believe that a chimpanzee has a higher level of self awareness and higher capacity for emotional distress than that of a chicken. For this reason, I do not believe that "meat is meat". 

Similar arguments could be made for dogs (although I do not personally have an opinion on it). Regardless of where you draw the line at meat eating (and I think most of us do draw a line somewhere), I don't think it's hypocritical to do so.</text>

    <text>I've heard that pigs are generally more intelligent, "self aware" than dogs.</text>

    <text>This may be true, I don't know, and I don't have an opinion on dog meat, but I was only really addressing the part where he implied that all meat is the same morally. I think that each type of animal should be taken as its own case. As long as the criteria that you use is consistent in your own decision making, then I don't think it is hypocritical. </text>

    <text>very reasonable. 

I think though that most western reactions to consuming dog is emotional and/or from a localized sense of "normal". I find this criteria to at least border on hypocritical.</text>
