    <title>CMV: Tone Policing is OK</title>

Just from the get go, I want to say that I am rather on the left as opposed to being on the right or liberal. What I am about to say, therefore, is targeted as people who lean left but it is applicable to anyone. 

I have a feeling a lot people are going to disagree but here me out on this one but, I don’t really subscribe to the received definition of tone policing. If we go to my favorite source, Wikipedia, we find this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_policing). If you don’t feel like reading the whole thing, check out this quote: 

*Tone policing has been described by one writer as "when someone (usually a privileged person) in a conversation or situation about oppression shifts the focus of the conversation from the oppression being discussed to the way it is being discussed. Tone policing prioritizes the comfort of the privileged person in the situation over the oppression of the disadvantaged person."*

This to me seems a rather narrow definition? Tone policing is a lot of things. The term “mansplaining” is policing the tone of arrogant and pompous men with privilege who try to talk down to people. When we use the word “mansplain” we are criticizing pretentious men for their condescending tone. A similar case is the use of the term “Karen”. What are Karens? They are women who demand things in an overly aggressive and entitled manner or tone, right? I think that there are few rational people that would argue that men should never try to explain things, or women should never raise valid concerns about customer service. The terms “mansplain” and “Karen” exist to police tone. 

What’s more, no one likes being tone policed. Mansplainers would never admit that they’re mansplaining, Karens would never admit that they are Karening. And it’s not hard to understand why. When we use these terms, we are changing the focus of what they are they are trying to say to how they are saying it. We are not listening to them. 

But I would argue that’s OK. Because no one wants to listen to something that is being said in a rude, condescending or confrontational tone. Not your partner, not your kids, not your parents, not your teachers, not your students, and certainly not your audience. Tone policing is OK. 

But there is a qualitative difference when tone policing is done by privileged people to marginalized people, right? 

Yes and no. I understand that not everyone has equal access to power and a lot of people have perfectly valid reasons to lose their temper when someone inadvertently insults them in a demeaning and dehumanizing manner. However, this does not change fundamental facts of human nature and human behavior. Think about it for a second. People who are insulting can be insulting in one of two ways, purposefully and inadvertently. Let’s look at inadvertently first. 

Imagine that someone, an African-American woman, is offended by a middle aged coworker who uses some horrifically outdated and tone deaf but ultimately innocuous phrase like, “forshizzle”. Yuck.

And this is infuriating. I get that. But what is the proper way to deal with this? To shout at the coworker? To berate and belittle them? What will that achieve? Most like fear and resentment about being publicly embarrassed about something that they did not intend to mean as offensive. That does not mean that we should let the offending coworker off the hook. But it does mean that we should be careful with our tone. Because if we don’t, we run the risk of alienating a lot of people who might otherwise be sympathetic. 

What about people who are intentionally offensive? What about racists, white supremacists, and alt-right trolls? Surely we can unleash our rage and fury on them, right? 

Wrong. And it’s not hard to understand why. Just think about it. If you are someone who finds themselves on the non-Trumpian side of American and world politics, I’m willing to bet you love watching videos of Karens throwing tantrums, or popular subreddits like r/insanepeoplefacebook or r/neckbeards or which are devoted to mocking privileged and entitled people. It’s funny to watch people lose their shit, isn’t it?

So, if you are someone deplores the rise of bigoted, intolerant, nativist politicians (like me), you’ll probably want to police your tone and the tone of your ostensible allies a bit *more*, rather than less. Throwing a tantrum, calling names, losing your cool is playing directly into the hands of your opponents. You are making yourself look ridiculous when you do that. You are making yourself look like them. 

But, one might say, it’s natural and healthy to express anger and frustration. Perhaps, in personal relationships, but not really in professional settings and certainly not in political ones. We are in for a bumpy decade and the last thing we need is to act as though losing one’s cool is a righteous political expression. Let’s work more on being measured, calm and ruthless in the pursuit of our goals. Contrapoints has a great video about this. [Check it out. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuN6GfUix7c) And change my view. I would love to hear from people who think that tone policing is a bad idea.</original_post>

    <text>&amp;gt;When we use the word “mansplain” we are criticizing pretentious men for their condescending tone. 

That's not what is being criticized actually. The men in question could be perfectly lovely or absolute asshats, it's the *behavior* of assuming they know more about a topic than women, especially women who actually have more experience and knowledge of the topic, that is being criticized.

Tone policing would be telling someone who was victim of a hate crime that they should stop crying about it and instead talk about it calmly, because you can't take them seriously. It's completely unreasonable to demand someone who faces trauma to somehow not experience that trauma in order to get you to take it seriously.</text>

    <text>But why should that be the sole meaning of tone policing?  

It's a great term, it has incredible potential.  And very useful potential, at that.</text>

    <text>Any word or phrase can have multiple meanings, for sure.

To me though, the question here is "how do the people who decry tone policing use it?" The OP is about how tone policing isn't bad, so clearly this is a response to people who say it *is* bad. Therefore, what do *they* mean when they say it?

By "they" I mean social justice oriented people, because that's who I see decrying tone policing. In my experience, what they mean by tone policing is how I've used it in the previous reply. Obviously you might disagree with some part of what I'm saying, but hopefully this clarifies where I'm coming from.</text>
