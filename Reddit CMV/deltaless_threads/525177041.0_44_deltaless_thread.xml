    <title>CMV: Pride parades should have less NSFW content</title>
    <original_poster>punmaster29</original_poster>
    <original_post>To preface, I'm bisexual and I love pride month and pride parades. However, I think that the amount of inappropriate content impedes some of the intent behind pride. 

To me, pride is about celebrating the LGBT+ community and promoting acceptance and understanding. It's about not being ashamed of who we love and what we identify as, and being able to share that with the world. 

I think the parade would ideally be a great place to bring our families, to show parents and children how incredible and talented the community is. I'm not out to my family, but bringing them to Pride would be a great start towards warming them up to accept me. But generally given the amount of public nudity and sexual inappropriateness at Pride, this is pretty much out of the question. 

In order to be more inclusive and celebrate love with as many people as possible, I think pride parades should tone down the sexual undertones and focus more on the concepts of love, pride, celebration, and acceptance. </original_post>

    <text>Much of the history of LGBT is the (I would argue "forced") rejection of sexual norms in our society. For the blunt example, homosexuality has been considered "inappropriate" by many (most!), thus leading to pride in the first place.  

If you see the "content" within that envelope I think it makes a lot of sense that the community pushes boundaries of sexual norms, and in this day does so on behalf  of a community that has grown significantly.

I have lived in San Francisco for nearly 30 years and I assure you that families are at pride _every single year_ - and that includes families witnessing all sorts of behaviors and sites.  What is great about that is that your kids then see variety of ways of being and thinking about sexuality and recognize that it's for them to decide, not a variety of potentially regressive and controlling social norms.
