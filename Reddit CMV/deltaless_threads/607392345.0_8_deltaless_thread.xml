    <title>CMV: Legislative bodies should be required to explain, in formal writing, why they voted a certain way when it comes to legislation.</title>

    <original_post>I think publicly elected officials responsible for driving policy and legislation should be required to explain why they vote certain ways in writing. Voting along party lines is reprehensible regardless of the side. Politics shouldn't be a game about which side wins, but rather which fact-based opinions win regardless of sides. If the legislative bodies have no reasonable explanation for why they voted a certain way besides voting along party lines, they should not be allowed to vote because we have no reason to believe that they're not voting out of self-interest. If, for example, someone in Congress voted against what seems to be reasonable gun law without explanation, but you can see in their financial disclosure that the NRA contributes a lot of money and support for them, how are we to know that their vote was not influenced by the NRA without them explicitly citing so and explaining what other reason compelled them not to vote for said reasonable legislation? I'm not even asking for a long written response from them. A short paragraph or page summary with sources they're using to base their vote on is good enough. </original_post>

    <text>Every answer would be essentially the same: "After intensive scrutiny of all available information and without regard to special-interest groups and the lobbying efforts of interested parties, I have determined that, for the common good and consistent with principles of good governance, that this legislation should/should not be passed."</text>

    <text>Lol. There's no "would be"... the house majority not that long ago passed a rule that every proposed bill have a direct explanation of how it relates to the constitution (or something similarly awkward). They then submitted bill(s) with a boilerplate sentence that "this bill relates to the constitution." Anthony Weiner (remember him) became famous for trying to object to this and got his objection overruled even though the majority couldn't even be bothered to follow their own rule.</text>
