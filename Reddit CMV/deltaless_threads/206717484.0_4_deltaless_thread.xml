    <title>CMV: I have no problem with the TSA and would honestly feel less safe if there wasn't the extensive searches</title>
    <original_poster>damienrapp98</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have never felt unsafe on an airplane. I used to have some fears related to them but those were mainly due to fear of turbulence and such, not terrorism. I think that this is mainly due to the TSA's policies. It's damn near impossible to bring any dangerous devices onto a plane.

I will disclose this. I was born in 1998 (17 years old). That means that I don't remember 9/11 (I remember that day, but not the significance) and I don't remember life before the TSA's newer policies. I grew up with them.

I just feel like the extra 30 minutes it takes to go through security is no big deal and generally gives me peace of mind. I totally understand minority complaints and I'm not arguing about those at all, but what I am saying is that the general (neither expedited or extended) search is totally reasonable and generally I don't feel annoyed or like my rights have been taken away in any sort of way.

    <text>Here are what I see as the biggest issues with the TSA:

A) Its invasive. Being x-rayed is one thing but the TSA is often submitting people to full body scans and occasional strip searches. Its also time consuming and annoying. You might not mind this because you don't remember a time when it wasn't this way, but if you did remember this or you were of a race (which you may be) that was subject to more invasive examination more often than you may feel differently. Its also a slippery slope when you start compromising liberty for security but thats a longer argument.

B) Its useless. [A recent study](http://www.citylab.com/commute/2015/06/airport-security-astoundingly-expensive-and-95-percent-ineffective/394778/) found them to be 95% ineffective. Those full body scanners that they spent a huge amount of money implementing? [Those aren't very good](http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/08/20/study-tsa-full-body-x-ray-scanners-miss-guns-explosives-knives/) at detecting the things you want them to. [They weren't even able to recognize](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tsa-fails-identify-73-employees-terror-watch-lists-n371601) that numerous aviation employees had active links to terrorism.

C) Its expensive. As of last year the budget of the TSA was $4.6 billion. That's not a huge amount of money when you compare it to things like defense spending or social security but is a lot when you compare it to less funded portions of our government and when you consider that its ineffective. [Here is the National Institutes of Health's Budget](http://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx). You'll see that we spend about $5.5 billion each year researching cancer. You could essentially double the amount cancer research in this country if you were to liquidate the TSA and put its budget towards better purposes.

So basically were sacrificing liberty, allowing strangers to invasively examine us, spends gobs of money and are no safer because we did so. That's a high price to pay for the illusion of security.
