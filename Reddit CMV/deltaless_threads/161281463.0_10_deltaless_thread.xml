    <title>CMV: there don't need to be hundreds of gender and sexuality names</title>
    <original_poster>YoungRecluse</original_poster>
    <original_post>I can understand gay, lesbian, queer, bisexual, asexual, pansexual, and aromantic. I can understand cis-, trans-, and a-genders. Why does there need to be demisexual and demiromantic and all that? Why do we need so many classifications of gender and sexuality? If you're attracted to the same sex, why can't you just be homosexual? If you're attracted to the opposite why can't you just be heterosexual? If you're attracted to both, why can't you be bisexual? Attracted to all? You're pansexual.
Keep it simple.

Also, I understand people getting offended and angry when they're misgendered, but getting angry doesn't really accomplish anything unless you can be calm in your education on the subject. Hating people for not calling you by your preferred pronouns the first time when they've never met you before is not going to accomplish anything. Hating cisgendered, heterosexual people will not accomplish anything. 

Please change my view.

    <text>For most people, the extent that they care about wine is red versus white, myself included. However, there are still many who delve into all the nuances between these types, and even some who become sommeliers. Why do you feel the need to shit on their parade?

These people aren't putting it in your face. You're not being forced to change your life or how you live. Why do you feel the need to dictate what they want to label themselves?

I had to look up what "demiromantic" is from your post, and if someone wants to label themselves that, it's fine with me.</text>
