    <title>CMV: Most people are not well read enough to reasonably advocate for political or economic change</title>

    <original_post>**Edit: "Well read" was a poor choice of words. I think "have done their due diligence" might be more accurate.**

I'm writing this because I want to be proven wrong, because people saying political things, especially as if obvious has started to annoy and anger me more. Especially if they're making fun of someone for their political views, even if I disagree with those views. I hate feeling angry, so hopefully writing my thoughts out will help.

In trying to figure out my own political views, I've come to realize that I can't reasonably hold the views I held, or any other views. I studied economics, mainly the school of thought that appealed to me. But then more and more I came to realize that I couldn't say if the Keynesian or post-keynesian or the Chicago school or MMT etc. were correct, and that even people who devote their lives to the study of economics struggle with the same thing. The same thing happened in philosophy, especially as I came to realize the importance of epistemology and ontology.

And you can't reasonably expect people to put in the effort and time that it takes to sort through these fields. And that there is still such debate among the experts that even if you become and expert, the truth will not be obvious. I've come to understand what Socrates meant when he said something like "I only know that I know nothing".

I've also come to believe that people hold the beliefs they do more for social reasons. Less for the truth of the beliefs, but more because their reaffirm their identity, and their social bonds.

I can't blame them for that, or for not spending thousands of hours sorting through political thought, philosophy and economics. But a part of me still believes that they haven't done their due diligence, and I get angry that they can affirm themselves and their beliefs, while I sit here uncertain, unable to succinctly articulate why, or how to get this across properly.</original_post>

    <text>Hi, how are you today? I have been developing a different school of economic thought based upon a logistics model, rather than a supply or demand model. Why? Because neither school of thought can totally account for why there is a difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics. But when you look at logistics, you begin to realize that a given economy begins to change as the logistics within the economy begins to change.

I don't want to give up too much as I am still developing it and working out the kinks. So far I have put together that the more of a given thing that is supplied the lower the cost of said thing is to produce, despite demand. This can be artificially controlled, but ultimately this applies to every single economy, even non-financial economies (like an ecology). There is more as well...

Ultimately people are going to take a given argument which supports their preexisting notions, despite what facts run contrary to it. This is the primary reason I haven't actually come out and made a bigger deal out of what I know. No point in saying "Hey look at this" without a butt ton of evidence to support it. I am open to people asking me questions though... (I will ask questions in response, and if you aren't open to answering questions I will ignore you.)</text>
