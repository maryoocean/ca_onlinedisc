    <title>CMV: It should be illegal to have a pitbull that isn't spayed or neutered</title>

    <original_post>Should be self-explanatory. I don't think we should straight up ban the breed, but getting such a dog fixed should be a legal requirement for owning one. Un-neutered dogs are \[responsible for the vast majority of serious attacks\]([https://www.avma.org/Advocacy/StateAndLocal/Pages/dogbite-summary.aspx](https://www.avma.org/Advocacy/StateAndLocal/Pages/dogbite-summary.aspx)) according to the AVMA. This would also result in a pit bull population decline which would reduce the huge number of pits clogging up shelters.</original_post>

    <text>Did you even read your own source? 

&amp;gt;Although this is a common concern, singling out one or two breeds for control can result in a false sense of accomplishment.14 Doing so ignores the true scope of the problem and will not result in a responsible approach to protecting a community's citizens.


Furthermore you might be confusing causation with correlation here. You can't say with any certainty that the reason that the dogs bite is because they're intact. consider for a moment the possibility that dogs that are intact are generally owned by less responsible dog owners and less responsible dog owners are also less likely to have trained their dogs well enough to not bite people.</text>
