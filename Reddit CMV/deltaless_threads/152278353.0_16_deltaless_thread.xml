    <title>CMV: If a business has two individual bathrooms, both should be unisex bathrooms</title>
    <original_poster>ricebasket</original_poster>
    <original_post>The bathrooms I'm describing are the ones where there's a single door and a small room with a toilet, sink, and trashcan that are used by one person at a time. I don't think there's any reason to divide them by gender. By equipment, they're identical I believe it's pretty uncommon for them to have urinals. Frequently the women's restroom will have a short line I have to wait in, while the men's stall is completely unoccupied. Occasionally I'll jump the line and use the men's restroom anyway, but people will give you strange looks. I've had men point out that they could not so easily do the same thing if there were a line at the men's room, and I think that's a really good point. If a business wants to provide a baby changing table, they could simply install one and mark it on the door avoiding the issue of either paying for two or only installing one in the women's room and leaving dads with infants out of luck. It's also beneficial to trans individuals who may feel uncomfortable using a gendered restroom.

I really can't think of any reason why this isn't more frequently seen. CMV!

Edit: Two counterpoints in response to common arguments:

1. From a management bathroom cleaning point of view, a unisex bathroom could be an advantage. Let's say a women's bathroom dirties by 10 dirt units every hour, the men's restroom by 8 dirt units every hour, and the restrooms are cleaned every 4 hours. That means you're more likely to get a customer complaint and have an employee need to go clean the women's room in hour 3, wasting some time. If you have unisex bathrooms it would even out and they each dirty at 9 units per hour, so it's easier to keep them both equally clean.

2. It doesn't make good business sense to have anyone tied up in a line. If there are 3 women waiting to pee and the men's stall is free, I don't want those women waiting around I want them browsing my store, paying the bill and freeing up a table, getting to their movie, etc. This argument also only favors men.

Edit 2: For all the talk of how terrifying women's bathrooms apparently are, I now feel like a hardened bad ass for using them all these years.</original_post>

    <text>If both restrooms were unisex, both restrooms would need a disposal for sanitary napkins. 

That is an extra trash can and an extra liner that needs to be replaced frequently. 

We can eliminate extra waste by keeping only one restroom open for sanitary napkin disposal. </text>

    <text>They don't need an extra trash can one trash can is sufficient</text>

    <text>I see. So a woman would have to carry her used sanitary napkin across the restroom to the one trash can next to the sink. 

How hygienic!</text>

    <text>Is there some scenario you're imagining where a woman is able to not touch her pad and the trash can is considered a sanitary environment?</text>

    <text>So like, they would waddle with their panties down to the other trash can before changing their pad? Put the used one on the floor whilst they finish up before delivering the used one to the bin? </text>

    <text>Wrap the used one up in toilet paper so it can be easily handled/isn't unsightly/doesn't spread blood. Place on the thigh, change pad, wipe. Hold in two hands and raise pants. Walk to trash can, flush toilet. Not difficult. </text>

    <text>Most individual bathrooms don't have an extra trashcan just for pads. They have one trashcan, and it's placed wherever it's placed (by the sink, by the toilet, whatever).

Also, even if this was an actual issue, it's one easily solved. So you spend 3 bucks on an extra mini trash can. That's not an actual issue.</text>

    <text>Exactly. You want people to spend three extra dollars when they don't have too. </text>
