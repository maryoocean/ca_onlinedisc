    <title>CMV: Christianity is held together through fear</title>
    <original_poster>M1STER_B0NES</original_poster>
    <original_post>My opinion is that if the fear of going to Hell was not present in the Christian ideology, then most of the followers of the religion would not be there.

Before I decided I was agnostic, that was my only reason for continuing to identify with the religion. Then, I decided I wasn't going to let fear control me. 

All in all, I don't see how this is any different than blackmailing a person to do what you want. You present your instruction, then tell them how you will completely devastate their life if they do not follow through.</original_post>

    <text>Before I became a Christian, the main thing that kept me away from God was not wanting to be under God's rules. Eventually I saw God's rules and guidance as a good thing instead of a fun killing thing; like when I keep my daughter from touching my hot coffee. I'm not doing it to be mean or because I like being controlling, it's because I don't want her to get harmed. My point is fear was never really a factor. I remain a Christian because I believe Christianity is true and because I see it as a good thing in my life.</text>

    <text>OP is talking more about hell, and the fact that if you don't choose to believe (which isn't  strictly possible) in Jesus Christ, you get tortured in the worst possible way for what is a literal eternity. 

If this wasn't the case, a lot of people wouldn't bother with it.

That said many people don't do it out of fear. What you are saying makes sense. In many cases Christianity makes people's lives better.</text>
