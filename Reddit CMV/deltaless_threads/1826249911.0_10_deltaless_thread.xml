    <title>CMV: The only form of government that exists is Opportunism</title>

    <original_post>Everything else is just propaganda. History has proven time and time again that countries will always do/find a way to do what they think is in their best interest, quite irrespective of morality, laws, or even their own “constitution”. These labels of government and/or thinking one type of governing is always better than another is purely a result of propaganda and has been a great blinder throughout history. 

In group vs out group aka “us vs. them” thinking has been shown by research to be one of the best predictors of human thought and behavior and it has been utilized by those in power for much of human history to control the masses.</original_post>

    <text>While imperfect, checks and balances exist in most modern democracies. 

The president wanting to do something, but Congress or the courts not allowing him too, happens almost daily. 

Yeah, sometimes governments do shitty things, but having one person with unchecked power is pretty different than having multiple parties each with some power. We literally see this everyday, when the president (Biden, Trump, and all the others) complains about how Congress or the courts impede their will.</text>
