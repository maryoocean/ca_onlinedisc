    <title>CMV: if you treat guns like toys, or mock gun safety, you aren’t responsible enough to own guns.</title>
    <original_poster>snbrd512</original_poster>
    <original_post>First off, if you want to own guns, that’s your business. However, I see WAY too many people on social media doing irresponsible things with them. Waving them around in stupid videos, posting pictures of them “dressed up”, and posts mocking basic gun safety like locking your shit up. This level of reckless irresponsibility not only makes you look like an idiot, but is fodder for liberals who are scared of guns (that said, I am 100% in support of better background checks and mental health screenings for gun owners, especially those who hoard guns). Anyone who has ever been in the military, or even taken a gun safety class, should know that guns aren’t toys, and you treat your weapons with respect, yet many people don’t seem to understand this. 

I guess what I’m asking is for someone to defend the viewpoint that their guns are their right and they can use them how they like. 


Edit: so far I haven’t seen an argument that isn’t “SECOND AMENDMENT!!!!!”  which doesn’t at all address the responsibility aspect of my post. I get the law says one thing. I’m not arguing the law. I’m talking about whether or not someone is responsible enough to own guns. Maybe I didn’t articulate that well enough. </original_post>

    <text>I would argue that treating ‘guns like toys’ or enjoying them in the context of leisure is much more relieving to me than those who purchase and covet them as a default way to feel safe or protected. The latter being more readily inclined to exact a human toll...all concern for gun safety practices aside.</text>

    <text>I think you are thinking I mean buying guns to go target shoot or whatever. I don’t. That shit is fun. I mean Danny Dumbass who waves around a loaded gun in his moms basement while rapping to 6ix9ine and ends up putting a hole in the ceiling. </text>
