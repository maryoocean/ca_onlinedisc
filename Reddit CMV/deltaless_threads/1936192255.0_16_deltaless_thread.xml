    <original_post>I'm sorry but as an artist and painter it grinds my gears when I see all these tik toks with artist wasting paint. I understand splatter painting to a degree. A few droplets aren't going to kill anybody but when it is just people throwing paint cans and it ect it's ridiculous. It's pretentious and honestly your not really making art. Your making just a mess and it's incredibly wasteful. 

In the age of environmental destruction paint is one of the worst and most toxic things you can emit into the world. There's been multiple articles and studies on how it facilitates climate change and all manner of other issues! If you're going to use a resource like paint use it efficiently!

If you don't you're kind of an ass.

Shit my link wasn't saved. What I mean by wast is this art trend https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRM7gN4y/?k=1</original_post>

    <text>Of course everyone should be disposing of their paint in eco-friendly ways, but usually when talked about paints effect on the environment, it is more to do with the paint on houses or the hulls of ships. Someone spending a day making an art project has essentially 0 effect on the environment compared to the big uses of it. Again dispose of your paints properly, reduce, reuse, recycle, and all that, but let's not pretend any individual holds a candle to the megacorps when it comes to affecting the environment.</text>
