    <title>CMV: Governments should conduct population control</title>
    <original_poster>memestar2016</original_poster>
    <original_post>We’re an extremely overpopulated people and Earth can’t handle this many people. That’s why population control needs to be a thing, favorably on a global scale. The law should be as follows:

No Household should be able to have more than 1 child (keep this up for 2 generations and then change it to 2 in order to keep it static). We wont have to worry about jobs, AI can take care of that. 

Individuals should be rewarded for sterilization. Reproduction should be discouraged. Forced abortions will be enforced on those breaking this law. Allow abortion until birth + allow euthanasia on &amp;lt; 2 month olds (They’d be unaware of what transpires and would not really be aware (not only because of anesthesia but also because age)).

No age purge though: elders have suffered enough already and would diacourage people from working.

I know this is a very controversial opinion and youll think I’m some troll, but fewer people would Also mean that the ones who survive would have better quality of life, climate change would slow down etc. The ends sometimes justify being a bit mean, but ultimately is for our own good.</original_post>

    <text>Starting from the beginning, overpopulation is largely a scapegoat. Lack of resources isn’t the problem, it’s unequal and inefficient distribution. When it comes to pollution, it also isn’t to blame: the richest 10% of the population is responsible for over 50% of all carbon emissions. 

Even if overpopulation were to blame, this wouldn’t be the way to go about combating it. The effects of instituting a one child policy can be seen in the real world: in China, it didn’t do much to curtail population growth. What it *did* do, however, was disastrously affect the sex ratio. Female infanticide is common among countries where male offspring are more valued, and I don’t think I need to point out the negative affects of this. As for forced abortion, this is neither ethical (in my opinion) or feasible. Who would perform all these abortions? How would you enforce this? Euthanasia of those younger than 2 months is even less practical. Believe me, you’d have a really hard time getting people on board with this one. 

So, how would one go about reducing the population? As it turns out, the answer isn’t quite so social Darwinist. An increase in access to contraceptives, comprehensive sex education, higher levels of education in general, and financial stability all lead to lower birth rates. 

Hope this all made sense. 
 
Oh, fun fact: we are currently producing enough food to feed about 10 billion people.</text>
