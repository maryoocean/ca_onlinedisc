    <title>CMV: The notion that the Democrats or Republicans "must" run Biden or Trump "because there are no other viable candidates" is ridiculous. There are thousands of people who would make better presidential candidates for 2024 than Biden or Trump.</title>

    <original_post>Every argument for Biden or Trump to run in 2024 boils down to some version of "status quo" or "inertia." We're told that the Ds and Rs have no choice but to run these super-old candidates because there's nobody else who could be suitable.

&amp;#x200B;

In a nation of 332,000,000 people, there are well over 100 million who are over the age of 35, American-born, and have resided in the United States for 14 years or more - in other words, are constitutionally eligible to run for president.

Out of those 100 million, surely at least half have a basic education, are mature, sensible, decent people, and have demonstrated solid character - and also be significantly younger than Trump or Biden.

Out of those 50 million, surely at least ten million would qualify as *highly* educated - the metrics of which can be tricky to figure out (is it a master's degree? or something else?) - but they would be significantly above average.

Out of those 10 million, surely at least one million would be quite exceptional - people who have substantially high IQ, have advanced quite far in life and a career - such as being a doctor, or having worked in public governmental service for decades, etc.

And out of those million, surely at least 10,000 would have the political know-how, the charisma, the political interest, maybe have spent significant time abroad in foreign countries or speak multiple languages, to be a suitable president.

In fact, even in Congress, state legislatures or governorships alone, there must be dozens of good, qualified, educated, experienced politicians who would be much younger than Trump or Biden, and who would make suitable presidential candidates. 

So, CMV on this one. I don't buy for one moment the notion that, in a nation of 332 million people, America somehow has no choice but to run Biden vs. Trump in 2024 because "we've got no one else who'd be a good candidate."  </original_post>

    <text>This is what elected Trump in the first place. 

The American public was sick of Clinton, Bush, etc dynasties. It didn't help that the [DNC openly worked](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/23/us/politics/dnc-emails-sanders-clinton.html) to prevent Bernie Sanders from getting their nomination. People hated Clinton but the DNC didn't care. The DNC never ceases to disappoint. 

There are plenty of better candidates than Trump, one being Ron DeSantis. 

Unfortunately, political science teaches us two things: name recognition and money wins elections, NOT good politicians.</text>

Could good politicians get name recognition and money e.g. a crazy idea I had is some ideal scenario for the Democrats of if a progressive celebrity gets some lower political office (like though I'm not saying it'd have to be him that does this, one of the The Good Doctor cast members literally just left the show to run for the Senate) and after some time in there to get experience runs for president as they'd have the equivalent of the same advantage as Trump had for the right being a name everyone knows (or if they're an actor like the Good Doctor guy at least people would know their character)</text>
