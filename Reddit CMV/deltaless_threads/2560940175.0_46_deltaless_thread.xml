    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>I lived in Basel, Switzerland for a while. If you are not familiar, Basel is on the Rhine and spills over into Germany and France.  I was quite surprised at first to hear Europeans calling me an American. I came over from living in LA, and when my European friends found out, they dropped calling me an American and would take great pride in introducing me as ‚Äúmy friend from California‚Äù. It often felt like I was a celebrity and I got lots of inquiries about what celebrities I might personally know.  I loved it! üòä</text>
