    <title>CMV: Donald Trump has taken concrete steps toward establishing a fascist regime, and "losing an election" won't be enough to successfully remove him.</title>
    <original_poster>MaichenM</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm not here to argue whether Trump will win the election, I'm here to argue that it may not matter whether he does.

Right now, what is happening in Portland is what I've come to understand through observation as Trump "flexing" against the barriers that constrain him. No one has been permanently harmed by federal agents purely because that would be too big of a step, too early. He is normalizing the relatively minor violence of terrorizing protesters without actually charging them, and priming the GOP base that supports him to readily accept more severe violence against those that do not support him.

This kind of flexing has gotten Trump really far. He throws something out that sounds insane at first and lets people digest it. Then he does a relatively minor version of it. Once that is normalized, he ups the ante.

The one that worries me the most is his continuous teasing over whether he will accept the election results, and casting doubt on the validity of the election in general. This is coupled with the fact that he still has four months to look at polls, reflect that he is losing, and decide that he must maintain his power undemocratically if necessary. Even if he doesn't come up with a plan to do so, now, there will still be a two-month gap until Biden's reelection that is usually expected to serve as a nice buffer for an orderly transition of power. I know I've mentioned plans, but Trump doesn't need a plan, here. All he has to do is say: "No." At this point, all the resources of the federal government will still be under his control, and his supporters will have already been primed to accept violence toward protesters.

For the purpose of this view, I don't need Trump to successfully install fascism in the US. If he is removed through force, I will still consider myself "right" in the sense that a peaceful election was not enough. My view will be changed if I'm led to believe that Trump will lose the presidency without necessitating violence, or inciting it for his benefit.

EDIT: I have already awarded Deltas to some people who argued in good faith. Starting now, I can't promise that I will respond to everyone, but I definitely will no longer engage with anyone who argues with me on bad faith, or uses personal insults. Thanks to everyone who has presented good arguments.</original_post>

    <text>Has Trump given you the feeling at one point of his presidency that he was an evil mastermind with a plan and great determination to give his life for a cause?

My point is simply that Trump is not stupid to the point of not realising the risk that it represent to refuse to leave and not 'courageous' enough to actually do it. It's way more likely that he will just whine on Twitter for four years while trying to avoid prison and bank on his name than going all-in in a revolution.</text>

    <text>This is a compelling argument.

However, I do think that he is fully capable of asking other people to defend him, and that he doesn't know how to back down. I think that so long as other people's lives are on the line, he will easily risk violence to stay in power.</text>

    <text>If he loses, he will rant non-stop on Twitter, will probably try to involves lawyers if the result are close and even maybe call for his supporter to manifest but as soon as it will become dangerous for him, he will stop. 

He’s not brave at all and hasn’t any conviction worth ending in jail.

So you can make any scenario about what will happen based on him being a sore loser and stupidity but scenarios based on him having a plan to seize power by risking his life and fortune? Not a chance</text>
