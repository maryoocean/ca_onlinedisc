    <title>CMV: Debt forgiveness is one of the stupidest ideas ever conceived</title>
    <original_poster>Ndlaxfan</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'll start this off by saying that I am in my last year of high school, and I will hopefully be attending a school that is about 60k a year. However, I will be graduating with under 5k in debt. I've worked my ass off for scholarships, and so far I've gotten about 205 k paid for. Most of the debt-forgiveness advocates are students who bit off more than they can chew, and will be swimming in piles of debt. If the government completely forgave debts, then they completely dick every financial institution in America. I view it like this: why would you go to an upscale restaurant, gorge yourself with food, and then be pissed off and demand that you can't pay the bill?</original_post>

    <text>What if you had worked your ass off but still didn't get a scholarship, because lets remember, there are a finite amount available. Wouldn't you be singing a different tune if you came out of college with a degree that likely counts for very little in the real world and 240k debt? </text>

    <text>I wouldn't go to that institution if I knew I couldn't afford it. Just like I wouldn't put a down payment on a 2 million dollar house if I could only afford a 400,000 dollar one. </text>

    <text>Then maybe getting a worthless 240K degree isn't the best decision.</text>
