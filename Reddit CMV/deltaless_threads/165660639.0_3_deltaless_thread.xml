    <title>CMV: Activity on the internet should be much more heavily regulated</title>
    <original_poster>e05bf027</original_poster>
    <original_post>Before I begin, I understand how unpopular the following will be on a site such as this, but I really want to hear opinions. I have, over the last little while, gone from feeling that essentially unregulated and uncensored activity on the internet is a good thing, to believing the opposite. Here are my reasons, though not in a particularly lucid or well-structured form. Also, I understand that the gap between principle and practicality is vast, so I offer my points only as ethical ones.

Libel: Essentially the internet is a publishing platform. If a newspaper or other media outlet has to obey the laws of libel and defamation, should an individual who is publishing things publicly not have to do the same? As an example, earlier I read a comment in a thread about Ted Nugent. The comment made a fairly strong statement regarding his sexual preferences. If this was on TV or in a newspaper, the outlet would be in seriously dodgy territory. In this case, an anonymous person can say anything and gets to live by different rules, despite the intention being to publish their view for worldwide public consumption. I think this is wrong.

Data protection: Despite the above, I think companies should be extremely limited regarding what data they are allowed to store about people. The fact that millions of lines of code in various places churn through my online activity and that Google, Amazon, etc. have a virtual model of me should not be allowed. For example, Amazon should not be allowed to record the history of what I browse. I see this as akin to having a shop assistant follow you round a store with a camcorder as you browse and believe that companies who do this should be heavily prosecuted.

Piracy: I understand that the issue of piracy is a complex one, but I feel that a growing attitude treats all information in digital form as almost a right. I think this is wrong, and that all copyright laws should be equal regardless of whether someone sells fake DVDs from their car boot, or runs a torrenting site. I believe that Google should not list any sits that link to illegal copyright infringement, and that they are complicit in the violations of law.

Now, I understand that there are a great deal of complicated parts of this, especially when it comes to things like expressing dissident political views, government surveillance, etc. and I know how ill-formed my point is. I suppose that by offering these views for criticism and rebuttal I want help clarifying what I truly think.

TLDR: Unregulated, anonymous activity that is largely without personal consequence is not a good thing. People should be as liable for what they do online as if they did it on TV or in the middle of the street. 

Edit 1: let me be explicit in saying that I am not claiming innocence of any of these things, but that recently I have been asking myself ethical questions and an uncomfortable with answers I find myself giving, and my beliefs are changing because of it.

Edit 2: I have to go out for the rest of the night, but I will reply tomorrow and give more thought to all points made. Thanks for taking the time to reply, I already have a lot of food for thought.

    <text>For number 2 in particular, it's pretty impossible to not have that happen. When you're visiting Amazon, you're putting your virtual presence onto their property (their server), and they literally write the rules there. It's similar to how you follow the rules of the homeowner when you're in someone else's house, or you just don't go there. But that's a bit of a sidetrack: It's difficult to not have some log of at least "IP Address X visited page Y at time Z" or "IP Address X logged in as user Y"; all they're doing is running some scripts to correlate that data to offer things you might want to buy.</text>

    <text>Of course, in reality my point becomes silly and unworkable at some stage. It is a little like asking a shop to never record when they are busy, or ask shop assistants not to remember what parts of a store are getting a lot of attention. I certainly find it disturbing when an item follows me around the internet (I know this is a distortion of the actual mechanism). I find the idea that a website has any information about me personally, other than the purchases I made, to be disturbing.</text>

    <text>But why? Apart from the sales aspect, those logs are essential for things like site uptime and preventing malicious attacks. That very same data is used to not be low-hanging fruit to hackers and to identify glitches and patch bugs. From a technical standpoint, websites would have a very difficult time operating without that same data. 

Of course, cleaning out your cookies is a good way to deal with the items following you, but they're not really following you so much as you accepted them onto your machine.</text>

    <text>I'm a little confused - are you disturbed by people/items following you around, or by their use in trying to predict what you will buy? Because while brick-and-mortar stores don't follow you around (although as you noted, they certainly *could* track you through CCTV), these stores still predict what you buy - like the case where Target figured out [a teenager was pregnant before her parents knew](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html?pagewanted=all). And that was done *without* "information about her personally", but based only on the purchases she made.</text>
