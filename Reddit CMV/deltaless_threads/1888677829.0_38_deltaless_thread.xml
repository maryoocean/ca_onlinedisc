    <title>CMV: It's stupid to care about the environment in space.</title>
    <original_poster>MostRecommendation84</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm a big proponent of space colonization/exploitation and every time I bring it up there's someone who says something along the lines of "Oh we're gonna trash the Moon like we did Earth?" "Oh good more mining!" "Humanity won't rest until we've exploited everything we can!" and other snide comments to that effect. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Honestly, it just sounds like the dumbest argument to me and I wouldn't even be bothering with a CMV if I hadn't heard it so many times. *It's rocks. Uninhabitable barren rocks floating through vast chunks of literally* ***nothing****.* There's no space squirrels to worry about, we haven't found any aliens and we really have no reason to assume any are out there, let alone that they give a shit what we do to Mercury. Furthermore, you want to stop desertification or the human rights violations of cobalt mining, you're gonna be hard pressed to find a better solution than the absurd volumes of water and cobalt from here to the asteroid belt.</original_post>

    <text>There could be concerns if life gets found on Mars, Enceladus, or Europa. Any ecosystems there could tell us a lot about how agriculture on other exoplanets or habitats in the future might work.

I wouldn't so emphatically decide that there's no life. I'd expect simple microorganisms to be pretty common and wouldn't be surprised if we found some even elsewhere in our solar system. Based on the development of life on Earth, it took very little time for life to appear. Conversely it took a very long time to integrate mitochondria into organisms on Earth, which was the catalyst for our evolution beyond those simple organisms. We should probably assume that's the rarer step, while the emergence of life is relatively common.

If we're too brazen about colonization or exploration, we do run the risk of losing out on a lot of knowledge through introducing invasive microorganisms and otherwise destroying specialized species we might find that would help our interplanetary and interstellar endeavors in a huge way.</text>
