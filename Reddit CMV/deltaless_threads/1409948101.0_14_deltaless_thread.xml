    <title>META: Clarifying our stance on "Trojan Horse" CMVs</title>
    <original_poster>Poo-et</original_poster>
    <original_post>There has been uptick somewhat recently of posts where OP makes a claim that they do not believe in order to make a thinly veiled attack on something else entirely. This is usually done to illustrate a double standard they feel a certain group has. We would like to remind all posters of rule B which states *"You must personally hold the view"* and say that going forward we will be removing these posts on sight where they appear.  

These "trojan" posts are not suited to CMV because defeating the claim rarely results in a delta and merely unlocks the real view. There's also a lot of marginal rule 3 content that goes in the comment sections which probably should be avoided. I would advise posters to simply report and move on when you see one of these posts.  

You can talk about double standards in your CMV post, but you must make the positive claim you really believe in as part of that. 

If you have questions or more suggestions for the subreddit, I recommend forwarding them to r/ideasforcmv which the mod team is very active on.  

Thanks for making this place cool.</original_post>

    <text>Given what I've been seeing here recently, I'd like to suggest a temporary exercise, possibly to become a new rule:

&amp;gt; No CMVs that boil down to "Demographic group X is evil, stupid, fake, or bad." If you have a hostile attitude towards someone's race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, nationality, or the like, this is not the place to air it. Theological disagreements? Sure. "CMV: Religion X is the root of all evil"? No.

There are so many topics to discuss that don't reduce to "Those people over there suck!"</text>

    <text>It's a thought... but those kinds of views are the ones *most in need of being changed, even slightly*.</text>

    <text>But we can say republicanism is the root of all evil still, right?</text>

    <text>I mean, of course we can say things that are objectively correct. ^^^^^^\s</text>
