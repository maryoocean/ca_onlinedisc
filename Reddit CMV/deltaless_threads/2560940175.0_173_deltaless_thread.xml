    <title>cmv: There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as an “American”</title>

    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>It is a valid concern from your professor and classmates, but the problem is that there isn’t a proper alternative in English. 
Back home in Chile (I’ve lived in the States for a decade and a half), the country translates to “Estados Unidos de América” which is a literal translation of United States of America; However, we call Americans “Estadounidenses” which translates to something akin to *”Unitedstatesmen”* (I am not certain this is also used in other Spanish-speaking countries). Which makes me wonder how are Americans referred to in other countries/languages 🤔</text>
