    <title>I believe anti-depressants change who you are as a person rather than fix you to the way you should be. CMV.</title>

I've taken anti-depressants before, but I don't feel like they made my brain work the way it's 'supposed' to. I think however my brain works naturally, without the use of medications, is its REAL natural state.

When I took anti-depressants, it changed the way I looked at the people in my life, the way I see how things work, even some of my opinions! I didn't feel like the ME I've been my whole life. But when I went off again, though I was depressed, I felt like myself again.

Since this experience, I've been unable to believe that depressants make you the way you're SUPPOSED to be. I feel that your natural state is acquired without the use of any medications. I'm a little old fashioned I suppose. Change my vieeeew?

    <text>I understand how you feel. My anti-depressants sometimes makes it hard for me to think clearly, but I probably just need to change them around and find a better fit. Maybe that would help you too. Personally, my anti-depressants have been a (literal) life saver. They don't really change my personality so much as they make it easier to get out of bed in the morning. They keep the negative thoughts from spiraling so far out of control.</text>
