    <title>CMV: The only difference between AI (digital) life and human (physical) life is the material which sustains it</title>
    <original_poster>CarpeBedlam</original_poster>
    <original_post>To be clear, I’m talking about a theoretical AI which is designed specifically to be indistinguishable from a human, and accomplishes that goal. Also, I don’t necessarily mean an android that is physically equivalent (e.g. Ash from “Alien”), but just a digital consciousness living in a computer which is capable of replicating human behavior. At that point, I’m struggling to find a difference between the two that isn’t solely about the material required to sustain the life (blood, tissue, etc. for human life, silicon, copper, etc. for AI life).</original_post>

    <text>All energy on the planet is derived from the warmth of the sun, the power of the wind etc. Humans eat food, which is a solar powered product, sun to plants, plants to livestock, livestock to humans.

Machines also consume energy, from burning fossil fuels (the energy from which originated in the sun) and so on.

So I'd say the similarity is that all the energy comes from the same place the sun. Unless you power your AI with geothermal, but I don't think that's a widely implemented thing.</text>

    <text>True, that’s an interesting way to look at it.</text>
