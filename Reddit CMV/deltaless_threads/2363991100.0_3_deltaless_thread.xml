    <title>CMV: The government should tax companies that replace human employees with AI and AI-controlled production and service more, to subsidize people who suffered from that.</title>
    <original_poster>OutcastZD</original_poster>
    <original_post>I was inspired by a scenario prevalent in much sci-fi literature: people are subjugated by an artificial-super intelligence system and don’t have any opportunity but to waste their lives. I think it’s Jordan Peterson who said: if there’s no way out of a dilemma, we have to prevent it from happening in the first place. So maybe we should start regulating AI in a general manner and gradually establish a system where humans are the priority and take the initiative before it’s out of reach. If it’s somewhat irrelevant to reality, consider its mild form as huge tech companies are invading privacy to feed the algorithms databases, and the government is already incompetent at this. As a whole, the development of technology will be slowed,(but not too much as top companies have the incentive and funds to innovate, and will have more as inequality in society increases), but we will be better off in the long run.

And in recent days, the economy and unemployment rate is quite bad, and the redistribution may do some good to it. The taxation may somehow hurt the companies and the economy, but it’s mainly the large corporations that will pay the taxes(there should be a tiered taxation policy; small companies will have to pay little taxes), yet the benefits to the economy(employment and better market) may outweigh the costs.

It will require multinational cooperation to ensure its enforcement; still, there may be a practicality problem. But I hope you can provide some other convincing reasons to CMV. Many initiatives to protect the environment are not carried out, but we should still believe in and devote ourselves to environmental protection.

This may seem to be some anti-science stuff, but trust me, I’m the opposite of that kind of person. Been thinking about the Skynet type of thing since I was 7 or 8, and finally came out with some solution 

Edit: I forgot to edit this but I have changed my view. It’s so basically impossible to define what company uses AI and what don’t as it’s so prevalent in today. And AI is far from self-aware that kind of stuff nowadays, so it’s still a tool. Thanks for discussing and supplying information</original_post>

    <text>I can't speak for the sci-fi Skynet angle, which is fiction...

But AI is just another form of automation, I don't see why this concept would apply specifically to AI but leave out all other forms of automation.

I feel it's rather hypocritical that people now being affected by this new form of automation are hostile to it, but at the same time only too happy to benefit from all the automation developed in other industries which benefitted them to the detriment of many other professions at the time, that got phased out.

Every time society has adjusted to the new technology and we were all better off for it, why would this instance be any different?</text>

    <text>In fact I said this to someone else before, and I am absolutely not technology phobic. Perhaps I am just overthinking.</text>

    <text>I think the core idea you should respond to is that AI is just another tool.  Tractors replaced workers, excel spreadsheets replaced workers, any tool that reduced that amount of labor required to accomplish a task replaced workers.  What do you actually want to tax?</text>

    <text>Indeed taxation isn’t the solution, and I my original purpose is to strengthen the regulation not macro control. There is an episode of black mirror where the algorithm and anonymity aroused mass hatred and caused people to die. I think its the government’s responsibility to prevent this from happening.</text>

    <text>If you acknowledge AI as another form of automation and the benefits of society in developing these technologies, why should we attempt to impede it?

Has your view been changed?</text>

    <text>I get your point. But I think AI is more than a tool. For example, facebook algorithm can lead us to negative posts and comments.</text>

    <text>Tools can't perform negative functions or be misused?

Learning how to use a knife properly we can avoid cutting ourselves, it can also be used to commit crimes, but it is a very useful tool from cooking to woodworking, etc...

Pharmaceutical drugs can help heal, dull pain, cause addiction and kill by overdose.

Where would we be if we discarded every new technology because it could cause harm.</text>

    <text>It’s basically my fault for not clearing the statement. And I have no intention to discard it</text>
