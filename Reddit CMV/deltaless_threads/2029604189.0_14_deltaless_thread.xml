    <title>CMV: Sustainability, from a philosophical perspective, is misguided</title>
    <original_poster>Pyropeace</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've been an advocate of sustainability for a while. However, I've recently begun to question the underlying assumptions behind the sustainability movement. 

Nothing is truly, infinitely sustainable. The sun will eventually go nova, killing everyone on earth (if humans haven't already gone extinct by then). If humanity manages to escape Earth, then the universe will likely perish as well, depending on what model you accept. The universe is in a constant state of change, and nothing lasts forever. Is it better to be moderately happy for a long period of time or extremely happy for a short period of time? When talking about entire societies, I tend towards the latter, though on an individual basis I tend towards the former. 

Essentially, my question is this; what is the value in things that last a long time in a universe where nothing is eternal?</original_post>

Is that the dilemma we are facing? Technological advancement compounds over time, so the longer you last, the greater the chance of a technological breakthrough that pushes happiness to unforeseen heights.</text>
