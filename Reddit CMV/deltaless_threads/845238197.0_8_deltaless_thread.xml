    <title>CMV: The MLB should simply allow pitchers to communicate with their catchers via technology.</title>

    <original_post>I understand the history of the game and how important tradition is, but this imo is one of those situations where the sport simply needs to evolve with the times.

In the NFL, coaches can communicate with their quarterbacks via radios in the helmet. Is anyone complaining? We've already got instant replay in all major sports, is this not breaking from tradition? It's not exactly difficult to fixate a telescope lens on a catcher (home base does not move). This can be done from a high rise across the street from center field. With a little effort, the center field vantage point is undetectable in most ballparks.

As for tradition, what's worse? 3 years of .... "I wonder what could have been"... or allowing pitchers and catchers a more surefire option to communicate with one another.</original_post>

    <text>I 100% agree OP. Baseball's staring down an issue not seen since PEDs and corked bats. A well placed telescope a mile away can spy on signs in a stadium - sign stealing with technology isn't going away ever. 

MLB needs to get ahead of this and adapt to 2019. Let the catcher and pitcher communicate (via pulses or something).</text>
