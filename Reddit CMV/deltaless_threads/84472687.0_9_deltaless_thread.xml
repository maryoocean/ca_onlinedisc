    <title>[Mod Post] Welcome to all new readers!</title>
    <original_poster>IAmAN00bie</original_poster>
    <original_post>**This is Mod post 22. You can read the previous Mod Post by clicking [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e5yke/mod_post_looking_for_a_wiki_mod/), or by visiting the [Mod Post Archive](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/modpostarchive) in our wiki.**  

---          

I noticed there was a HUGE influx of new users just now, and I was confused on where they were coming from. Well, I was tipped off by a friendly user that [AdviceAnimals had mentioned us] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1ea3h6/got_an_essay_due_im_sure_someones_done_this_before/) in one of their top rated posts! To all new users coming in from AdviceAnimals, welcome! We're a (relatively) small community compared to you, but we hope that your thankfully positive attention to us will bring in more good members!  

Since there are a lot of new members coming in, I would also like to remind people to please **read the sidebar!** Following the rules of this subreddit is essential in making sure that we have good, healthy discussion about all sorts of topics.  

Also, I want to plug our newly created IRC channel: #changemyview on Snoonet! [You can join us by following this link here] (https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/changemyview?settings=dd892af474749b032ba39bb88a8894d9).   

edit: **the subreddit is public again, I disabled submissions for 15 minutes so us mods can catch up with this traffic!**  

edit 2: **DELTA BOT HAS LIKELY CRASHED DUE TO THE OVERWHELMING ACTIVITY!** Don't worry, we'll catch all the missed delta awardings when the owner reboots the poor bot :(

    <text>I like that the scores are hidden - Are comments still sorted by most popular, regardless?  One of my biggest problems with Reddit is the bias and groupthink that comes from its flawed voting system - but even more the majority that fails to see that they are victim to the groupthink</text>

    <text>At the same time, I dislike being unable to see my OWN comments ratings.</text>

    <text>Which makes the hiding of comments points ... pointless. CMV</text>

    <text>That was actually more or less the sense of a post here a couple of days ago.</text>
