    <title>CMV: There are no good or bad music genres, just good or bad artists.</title>

    <original_post>I get it. Rock is your favorite music genre, you hate country or pop. Whatever it is, it doesn’t make your favorite genre “the one”.

Music is like food. There’s pizza, hamburguers, sandwiches, tacos, burritos, nuggets, etc. That doesn’t make one better than the other. But there are people or restaurants that can make great delicious pizzas and others who make average pizzas. The same way, there are amazing rappers with great lyricism and rhythm, and others who use an overproduced beat and have poor lyricism. There are Metal guitarists with great technique and years of experience, and others who don’t.

And this whole “my favorite genre is better than yours” thing applies to almost everything: books, videogames, movies...</original_post>

    <text>While obviously everything is subjective here, it's definitely possible to say with confidence that there are entire genres of music that you dislike. Take Goregrind for example. No matter how good or bad the artist is, most people are simply going to hate the entire genre. It is entirely reasonable to say 'I hate all Goregrind music'

Someone saying 'yeah but have you listened to the new album by 'Cock and Ball Torture' isn't going cut it. 

If the genre is not something you enjoy, then not matter how good the artist is, it isn't going to help you enjoy it.</text>
