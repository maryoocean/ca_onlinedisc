    <title>I believe that prayer does nothing to change the world. CMV</title>
    <original_poster>waterbluesky</original_poster>
    <original_post>Prayer as an act of reaching to a deity for help or comfort has no appreciable effect beyond what can be achieved by normal positive thinking.

Praying to end world hunger or to get a job has no effect unless you or someone else makes the decision to achieve the goal. These goals could also just as easily be achieved without prayer.

Edit: I do not believe in the non corporeal nature of prayer. I do believe in the effects such as positive thinking giving someone a better understanding of who they are a what they can do.</original_post>

    <text>"Normal positive thinking" can be achieved in many ways personal to those doing it.  One of those ways is called "prayer".  If it is easier for some people to frame their positive thinking through the lens of "prayer" then it is not necessarily "just as easy" FOR THEM to do it in another way.

I believe that there is a fundamental misunderstanding of "prayer" as something that people believe will magically change the world.  CMV</text>

    <text>I don't believe its intent is to magically fix everything. I do feel that the definition and what most people believe is that something comes from without to help them change something within the self or in the world. 

I do not dispute the focusing nature of prayer giving people more power (although I believe it can be just as easily found elsewhere) to find something within. I just don't believe something greater then themselves contributes in anyway.</text>

    <text>So, what you're really saying is "I believe there is no God, CMV"</text>

    <text>Well I don't but being able to understand this part of faith is more important to me changing my views then anything else. If I could understand why people believe prayer to work even if in the abstract I would be far closure to being able to understand the rest.</text>

    <text>And yet, you concede that the "power of positive thinking" is nontrivial.  Prayer works in precisely the same way.  It functions both as a tool for personal comfort and motivation as well as a method of community cohesion and support.

That some people see it as an actually, physically useful tool is likely a combination of post hoc reasoning and placebo effect, but that doesn't mean that it DOESN'T work to some degree.  Just like my lucky socks don't necessarily improve my inherent natural ability, nor will they change the flight path of my approach shot, but if they give me a level of comfort and ease, it is possible that they WILL reduce my score.

Either way, so long as prayer is backed by deeds (which is a teaching in most major religions) then I wouldn't say that it possible to functionally distinguish prayer backed by a god from that which is not.</text>

    <text>What does prayer give you that saying "I can make this shot" doesn't. If prayer doesn't change your approach shot why choose prayer over any other positive thinking?

What about prayer makes it better than any other positive thinking or how does it actually change the world.</text>

    <text>Who is claiming that it's better?  You seem to be having a different conversation.

If (for example) **I** find it easier to pray for my approach shot to hit the green than I do to simply force myself into thinking "I'm going to make this" then THAT is where the value of prayer comes from.  Because, in that situation, prayer works better FOR ME.

Just because it doesn't work for you doesn't make it any worse.</text>
