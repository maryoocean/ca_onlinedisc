    <title>CMV:/r/redditarmie should be banned for the continuous raiding and vote-manipulation of YouTube comments.</title>

    <original_post>*"Those who spend their time pretending to be obnoxious idiots aren't really pretending."*

In case anyone's unfamiliar with the subreddit and its users, they're the guys that leave comments like [this](http://i.imgur.com/LQcYICz.png) on all YouTube videos that are trending on Reddit.

It was fun the first few times or so, but at this point it's just obnoxious and annoying, to a degree where there are more than 10 'joke' comments before you can even get to normal comments that actually refer to the video.

Since it's not uncommon to see entire subreddits get banned for downvote-and commentraiding other subreddits, why is it okay for a sub to be entirely devoted to raiding YouTube videos and manipulating comment vote counts?

I don't see this discussed often on Reddit and when it does get mentioned it's often downvoted to a very heavy degree, so please CMV because I'm obviously not getting the 'joke' here. Even if the joke is being annoying on purpose.

Agreed, but I think you are taking things in the wrong direction.  Subreddits should not be banned at all, for any reason.\*  There are always going to be subjects that I disagree with but it is not my place to say that they do not have a right to exist.  The actions that site admins take for things that they do not like leads to arguments like the one that you have proposed.

\* I am aware of the fact that sometimes the site admins are legally required to remove certain content.  I don't agree with the action of doing so but I understand their desire in wanting to cover their own ass.  I feel though, that when they go beyond the scope of legal requirements they go enter a territory that no one has the right to inject their own set of ethics and morality over.</text>
