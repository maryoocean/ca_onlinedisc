    <title>CMV: Public transportation should run 24/7.</title>
    <original_poster>Keep-reefer-illegal</original_poster>
    <original_post>We live in a world that is no longer 9-5. Businesses stay open later, friends can reach us with a portable device simply by typing on a mini keyboard. It doesn't make sense that public transportation isn't 24/7. Here are some reasons why it should be 24/7:

1. Very few buses run at 2 am for last call, I feel like if nothing else, running buses later let's responsible drunk people take public transit instead of driving home. 

2. It would benefit the working poor who may work night shift 

3. As mentioned before our world is now 24/7 

Those are my arguments. 

I encourage you all to change my view 

Edit: by transit I am including trains, buses, all forms of public transportation, not just buses.

    <text>It's really just the obvious cost issue.  My experience is limited to buses, so I'll talk about them.

A city bus is $300,000 - $500,000 (those transit buses like Greyhound uses can be in the million dollar range).  The buses are bought in batches every two years or so.  Where I work they get sold (for peanuts) before they get to 100,000 miles and a new batch replaces them.  If we drove the ***same schedule*** 24/7 we'd be dropping the $7,000,000 on new buses twice as fast.  Of course on top of that, the maintenance costs are now doubled.  A set of tires for a bus is about $3,000 (everything on a bus is more expensive, and things get replaced **before** they break).  More mechanics will need to be hired to work on all the buses, and maybe a larger garage would be needed if there are more being serviced at a time.  If I'm driving at 3:30 AM you're going to have to pay me more, because fuck those hours.  Now a bus can cost between $60 and $110 per hour to operate, when you run 24/7, naturally you'll be spending a lot more on things like fuel, etc..

So this is why you'll find if there is night service it's reduced in some way.  Buses come less often and will have a different route that covers more ground, but is less direct.  To have full service 24/7 would be very expensive, and you'd have to pay for it.  We'll probably see 24/7 service happening in Europe soon, they're more willing to drop tax dollars on infrastructure than we are here in the States.</text>
