    <title>CMV: There is no reason a “God” should give Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>Protagoras67</original_poster>
    <original_post>I want to disclose that I am both an atheist and a hard determinist. I do not believe in any sort of creator and I have a hard time believing in Free Will. From what I understand from a Christian perspective, God gives humans free will in an effort to test them. But what i don’t understand from their point of view is why would God do that in the first place? Isn’t God omnipotent? God could just design the universe however it wants, we could have all been programmed to behave a certain way from birth and believe in God from birth and follow one religion as opposed to having a myriad of them. There is no reason to test us, it’s completely unnecessary.

Again, I’m not challenging anyone to prove God exists, I am just trying to understand the theological logic of this.</original_post>

Even if he wants to design the universe with free will? Maybe *that's* the reason he does it.

I mean think about it. Almost anybody who is interested in artificial intelligence would *like* to be able to create a sentient computer with free will. That would be the pinnacle of achievement for an AI programmer.

If there is a God, it seems like he should be the most free to do what he wants of any being imaginable, so if anybody were to just create something simply because they wanted to, it would be God. That is reason enough for God to create things with free will--because he wants to.</text>

    <text>The difference being god knows in advance how it all goes (unless you aren't giving god the all-knowing characteristic). If i knew for a fact that an AI i created will go on to kill millions of people....... i don't create it.</text>
