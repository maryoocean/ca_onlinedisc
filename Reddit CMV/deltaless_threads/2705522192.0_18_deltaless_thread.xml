    <title>CMV: Bodybuilding is stupid</title>
    <original_poster>RaindropDripDropTop</original_poster>
    <original_post>I want to be clear, I'm not talking about lifting weights in general, I'm specifically referring to competitive bodybuilding, especially when it involves cycling a bunch of gear (using PEDs), and getting to dangerously low body fat levels and severe dehydration to go on stage.  

I definitely recognize that competitive bodybuilders have insane levels of dedication and training. It is without doubt incredibly difficult to achieve those type of physiques, even for people with top tier genetics who use PEDs. Even the most genetically blessed and steroid enhanced bodybuilders still work insanely hard. I am not doubting their work ethic and drive. What I think is stupid about it is why do people think that this is worth it. 

For starters, it is purely for the sake of vanity rather than athleticism or strength. A bodybuilder might look absolutely insane, but functionally speaking, actual athletes who train to maximize athletic ability have way more physical capability depending on what sport they train for. Whether it's strength, speed, endurance, acceleration, vertical leap, flexibility, dexterity, or a combination of all these things, bodybuilders just aren't nearly as physically capable as actual athletes who put in similar time and effort into their training.

On the topic of vanity, bodybuilder physiques don't even look attractive or aesthetically pleasing. Obviously this is subjective, but the vast majority of the population is way more attracted to a healthy athletic physique than they are to a bodybuilder physique. I get that bodybuilding isn't really about looking attractive, rather it is about pushing the limits of what is possible with the human body, but it's honestly kind of just a freak show.

The biggest reason bodybuilding is stupid is that it is insanely unhealthy. Even for natural bodybuilders who don't use PEDs, they are still getting to dangerously low body fat levels and becoming extremely dehydrated in order to achieve their stage physique. This is incredibly taxing on the body, and it's extremely common for bodybuilders to suffer severe health issues because of this. For the ones who do use PEDs, which is basically a requirement to become a top level bodybuilder, the damage to health is even more severe, and they suffer many side effects as a result, especially ones who are not properly educated on the drugs they are taking.

One might argue that bodybuilding might be worth it for the money, but the reality is that only the top few bodybuilders in the world are making significant money through this career. The vast majority of bodybuilders, especially amateurs and people who do regional or local shows, aren't actually making much if any money through this. They also have to dedicate insane amount of time and effort into training, and if they are using gear, they are spending a ton of money on drugs. Moreover, there are similar alternatives to bodybuilding that are way more lucrative and more accessible to most people, such as becoming a fitness influencer or something (not saying that many people can break into that field either, but it's more achievable than making money through competitive bodybuilding).

The reason I am asking for my view to be changed is because I want to hear opposing perspectives, and maybe someone can shed some light on what I am missing. Like I said, I respect the work ethic and drive of bodybuilders, I just have a really hard time wrapping my head around it. I totally respect people's rights to do whatever they want with their body so long as they aren't harming others, I'm really just trying to understand the mindset of a bodybuilder, or at least understand what the appeal is.</original_post>

    <text>Well I think it's appealing for a couple reasons. For one it's something that's difficult and takes dedication meaning that it's going to be rare. People like doing stuff that sets them apart, this does that. It's also a look that many people like to varying degrees. I think it can look cool or impressive but people starts to look ridiculous at a certain size. As a man who has worked out for many years, actually being a "bodybuilder" is difficult. I  don't think it's worth the sacrifice and don't have a personal draw to it so I only workout to stay in shape enough to engage in my physical hobbies.</text>

    <text>They would be better off applying that dedication and training to build a healthy athletic physique, not an unhealthy bodybuilder physique</text>

    <text>If you're bodybuilding for fame or money you're not going to achieve either working out strictly for your health.</text>

    <text>Bodybuilding for "fame or money" is a terrible idea, it's not a lucrative field whatsoever. Very very few people actually make a living from competitive bodybuilding. It's way more achievable to make money even by being a fitness influencer than it is a professional bodybuilder, and the top fitness influencer make way more money than the top bodybuilders make</text>

    <text>I am extremely aware lol. That doesn't mean that it's not a motivating factor for some bodybuilders, especially young ones who don't understand that it's not actually lucrative. Some people make poor life choices.</text>

    <text>Yeah and poor life choices are stupid, hence my view that bodybuilding is stupid</text>
