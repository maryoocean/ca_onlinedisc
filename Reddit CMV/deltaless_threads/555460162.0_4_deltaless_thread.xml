    <title>CMV: Most people are not well read enough to reasonably advocate for political or economic change</title>

    <original_post>**Edit: "Well read" was a poor choice of words. I think "have done their due diligence" might be more accurate.**

I'm writing this because I want to be proven wrong, because people saying political things, especially as if obvious has started to annoy and anger me more. Especially if they're making fun of someone for their political views, even if I disagree with those views. I hate feeling angry, so hopefully writing my thoughts out will help.

In trying to figure out my own political views, I've come to realize that I can't reasonably hold the views I held, or any other views. I studied economics, mainly the school of thought that appealed to me. But then more and more I came to realize that I couldn't say if the Keynesian or post-keynesian or the Chicago school or MMT etc. were correct, and that even people who devote their lives to the study of economics struggle with the same thing. The same thing happened in philosophy, especially as I came to realize the importance of epistemology and ontology.

And you can't reasonably expect people to put in the effort and time that it takes to sort through these fields. And that there is still such debate among the experts that even if you become and expert, the truth will not be obvious. I've come to understand what Socrates meant when he said something like "I only know that I know nothing".

I've also come to believe that people hold the beliefs they do more for social reasons. Less for the truth of the beliefs, but more because their reaffirm their identity, and their social bonds.

I can't blame them for that, or for not spending thousands of hours sorting through political thought, philosophy and economics. But a part of me still believes that they haven't done their due diligence, and I get angry that they can affirm themselves and their beliefs, while I sit here uncertain, unable to succinctly articulate why, or how to get this across properly.</original_post>

    <text>That's why we're a representative democracy and not a direct democracy. Most of us do not know enough to make specific policy decisions, so we don't vote on every individual policy. What we vote on are who should be making those decisions. Candidates step forward and say, "Here are my basic views on how things should work, here are the reasons I'm qualified to make such decisions, and here's how I'm going to make this plan happen." Then we look at the candidate and decide if their basic views align with ours, if they seem like they know what they're talking about, and if we think they can actually get it done. We don't necessarily know enough about economics to make specific decisions, but our own life experience tells us enough to have broad opinions, right? Like, you don't need to know anything about economics to know if you think a flat tax or a progressive tax makes more sense. You may not know how to set the rates so that everything gets paid for and no one feels burdened, but you know generally what kind of system seems fair. So you can vote for a representative that feels the way you do and actually knows how to make it work.</text>
