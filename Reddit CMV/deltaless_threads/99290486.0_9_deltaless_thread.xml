    <title>I believe that if Washington can have the Redskins, I can have a team called the Black People. CMV</title>

    <original_post>I feel that many people would be offended if a city had a sports team that was called the [insert city] Black People, or even The Blacks, with their logo being a black man's head. However, people (for the most part) accept the fact that the Washington Redskins have all of those same elements, except with a Native American.

 I know that in the past, and perhaps even currently, there has been a movement to get these Native American team names changed, but as we know, mostly nothing has come of this. I feel like if I made a team whose mascot was a black man, that team would receive such outrage that it would never survive. But if the Redskins can exist, the Black People should also be able to exist. CMV.</original_post>

    <text>I'm agree with the OP because of a [point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxcABevPLNY) I heard on this subject. I wouldn't go up to a Native American and refer to them as a redskin. If I did they'd probably be offended by it because historically it is an offensive word used to demean Native Americans. 

And yes, the team has the right to call itself whatever it wants. If they stand to lose money by changing the mascot they won't do it. If they'll make more or about the same they might if it's not too expensive. They could just name the team after a particular tribe, they wouldn't even have to change the logo.
