    <title>CMV: YouTube was right in age-restricting Prager U's videos because a significant portion of their audience were children that didn't know better.</title>

    <original_post>TL:DR: &amp;gt;!PragerU was targeting a young audience that didn't understand what they were watching, and YouTube was right in age restricting PragerU's videos.!&amp;lt;

PragerU, a far right-wing media outlet popular on YouTube had it's videos age-restricted by YouTube so that only users &amp;gt;15 years old could watch them.

PragerU claimed that YouTube was censoring them and responded by suing YouTube on the grounds that they were behaving like a publisher while enjoying the protections of a platform.

(The following story should is and should be treated as an anecdote. Because the demographic data of PragerU's viewer base is not public information, this is all I have to go on.)

When I was younger (~9) I came across a video titled "[The] War on Boys". Being a boy myself, I had clicked on the video because of the title and the cartoonish graphics in the thumbnail. Being just over five minutes long, it was perfect for my young, short, attention span.

I have since forgotten the content of the video, but because videos from the same channel as the one you're currently watching are more likely to get suggested, I clicked on a few more blue-background cartoons.

I remember seeing Ben Shapiro, and through the next 3 years I would think of him as some sort of Genius who was always right, because of his childish argument strategies and constant insulting.

I have since disengrained the bullshit that PragerU puts out from my head, but I believe that they were targeting a younger audience with their cartoon drawings, short videos, and simple arguments.</original_post>

    <text>So, if you think that one platform expressing political views should be age restricted, you should think all political messaging should be age restricted.

If you want to talk simplicity, Bernie Sanders is simplistic to the point of easy parity, and the current President also makes 'arguments' any normally intelligent child  can follow and understand.

The thing that I notice most on the internet when it comes to political discussion and debate, is that everybody assumes they're completely right on everything. And by implication, you'd have no problem if your nine-year-old self came across short simple video's telling that nine-year-old the things you at your current age believe right now. Its that you think Prager U is incorrect that's making you think those video's should be age restricted.

The thing is, to a nine-year-old, any intelligent person who knows how to speak simply will come across as a super-genius. Not just Ben Shapiro.</text>
