    <title>CMV: Some cultural traditions don't deserve respect and outsiders should actively make an attempt to change them.</title>

I came across this video today, in which brides in a certain culture are kidnapped of the streets and are physically held and forced into marriage by their family (sometimes even just their distant extended family). In many cultures there are many flaws but almost all modern societies don't condone the forced kidnap and eventual rape of women. This culture will continue to cause real tangible and direct harm to individuals unless it is somehow changed from external pressure. This tradition doesn't deserve to be respected and deserves active attempts to destroy it by well meaning outsiders. I am trying to see if there is any argument behind the common view of "we must respect all cultures". I don't see how or why a culture that deprives people of fundamental human rights deserves respect, and how it is not the duty of outsiders to try to stop them. Change my view </original_post>

    <text>This is overblown.  Some of the brides actually smile and are happy afterward.  They’ll see it coming and even expect it.

It’s still messed up for those who wish to remain single.  But for those who actually like the guy and were anticipating the kidnapping, this is more tradition than forced slavery.  Again, still terrible for those who don’t want to marry.  </text>
