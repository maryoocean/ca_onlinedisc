    <title>CMV: Donald Trump has taken concrete steps toward establishing a fascist regime, and "losing an election" won't be enough to successfully remove him.</title>
    <original_poster>MaichenM</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm not here to argue whether Trump will win the election, I'm here to argue that it may not matter whether he does.

Right now, what is happening in Portland is what I've come to understand through observation as Trump "flexing" against the barriers that constrain him. No one has been permanently harmed by federal agents purely because that would be too big of a step, too early. He is normalizing the relatively minor violence of terrorizing protesters without actually charging them, and priming the GOP base that supports him to readily accept more severe violence against those that do not support him.

This kind of flexing has gotten Trump really far. He throws something out that sounds insane at first and lets people digest it. Then he does a relatively minor version of it. Once that is normalized, he ups the ante.

The one that worries me the most is his continuous teasing over whether he will accept the election results, and casting doubt on the validity of the election in general. This is coupled with the fact that he still has four months to look at polls, reflect that he is losing, and decide that he must maintain his power undemocratically if necessary. Even if he doesn't come up with a plan to do so, now, there will still be a two-month gap until Biden's reelection that is usually expected to serve as a nice buffer for an orderly transition of power. I know I've mentioned plans, but Trump doesn't need a plan, here. All he has to do is say: "No." At this point, all the resources of the federal government will still be under his control, and his supporters will have already been primed to accept violence toward protesters.

For the purpose of this view, I don't need Trump to successfully install fascism in the US. If he is removed through force, I will still consider myself "right" in the sense that a peaceful election was not enough. My view will be changed if I'm led to believe that Trump will lose the presidency without necessitating violence, or inciting it for his benefit.

EDIT: I have already awarded Deltas to some people who argued in good faith. Starting now, I can't promise that I will respond to everyone, but I definitely will no longer engage with anyone who argues with me on bad faith, or uses personal insults. Thanks to everyone who has presented good arguments.</original_post>

    <text>Trump isn't a dictator, he's a wannabee dictator.  So he talks a big game, but it's mostly other people that are actually making things happen.   So the question really isn't whether Trump flexes or whatever, but whether the people who can actually move and shake things do.   Considering the history of venal and incompetent behavior, I'm not sure the transition will be orderly, and there might be extra litigation, but Trump will back down long before removal by force becomes a real thing.

&amp;gt; ...  Even if he doesn't come up with a plan to do so ...

Can you provide an example of something that looks like Trump developing and executing well on a plan while he's in office?</text>

    <text>To be honest: No. I think he flies by the seat of his pants. But I do think that he is surrounded by people who *do* make plans. Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller's plans to advance racism and anti-immigration policies were very successful. And though they have both left, they've been replaced by others. I believe that given how Trump supports their agendas, there are many interested parties who would want to keep him in office.

Why do you believe that Trump would back down?</text>

He's got a history of abiding by court decisions and sucking up to military leaders and legitimate strong men.

If we want to talk about the theory that there's some deep state that's propping him up as a puppet, and that the deep state will keep him in place, that's a bit of a different topic.   It's hard to believe that the Steve Bannons are really running things when there's so much turnover (even if Stephen Miller is still working in the White House.)</text>

    <text>Right, sorry about the Stephen Miller thing. The turnover is so high that it confuses me, lol.

I think that the GOP's extreme support of Trump proves that honestly THEY are the interested party. He has done a lot for their agenda during his presidency, and even if they don't always side with him, he has been very easy for them to use to their advantage.

Can you link to his history of sucking up to military leaders and supporting court decisions.</text>

    <text>Consider how Trump interacts with Erdogan, Putin and Kim Jong Un.

As for court decisions, the word I used was "abide."  So Trump fights, delays, grumbles, and appeals, but I haven't seen him flaunt rulings.</text>

He's got more history of violating court decisions and looking down on military leaders and legitimate military heroes.</text>
