    <title>If I met a girl on the internet and struck up a relationship, I would make up an elaborate lie about how we met so people would believe we met 'offline'. CMV.</title>

    <original_post>I know there is less stigma about this sort of thing these days, but I still don't think I could say 'derrrr, we met online'.</original_post>

    <text>The stigma against online dating is mostly in your head. You probably think that if you tell people that you met your girlfriend online, they would judge you to be a loser who can’t meet girls in real life, so resorts to meeting them on the internet. But in reality, meeting girls/guys online and meeting them in real life are not mutually exclusive of one another – you can easily do both! In fact, I would argue that anyone who is single and trying to meet as many girls/guys as possible should be using some form of online dating for 2 reasons:  
  
1. It allows you to meet people you otherwise wouldn’t have met in the usual places you go to in real life (bars, clubs etc.).  
  
2. It doesn’t take much time. You can just set up a nice profile and wait for people to message you - zero time investment. Sure, you might not be getting that many messages, especially if you’re a dude, but getting 1 or 2 messages per month or even per year is better than zero. There’s literally nothing you can lose by having an online dating profile out there.</text>

    <text>I know many people out there that would still react that way - people still say, 'they met online? what losers'. I know we shouldn't worry about what others think, but who wants to be thought of as a loser?

Online dating profiles sound ok, but I look at subreddits like /r/cringepics and fear getting screen capped by someone and ending up there. </text>
