    <title>CMV: You should be allowed to take drugs and alter your conciousness in the safety of your own home.</title>

    <original_post>I believe that the government goes too far in deciding whether or not you are allowed to take drugs in the safety of your own home. You don’t stand to harm others, you only risk hurting yourself.

You can go rock climbing, skydiving, wingsuiting, rally driving and so on. 99% of the time nothing happens, and no harm is done. The same goes for drugs.

The war on drugs has done more harm than good. People who start out abuse drugs are usually doing pretty bad, and they cover up the void. That drug use only perpetuates the problem. You start failing economically, your social life declines, and the ditch just becomes too deep, so you can’t get out.

People have bad mental health, and self-medicate. I’ve been there. For me it was weed, for my grandfather it was alcohol, for some it is meth, and there are several other addictive behaviours in completely normal things, that are used to cover up a mental wound, something that hurts. Just like you get painkillers for a wound to numb the pain.

In every single drug, the abuse percentage is roughly 10%. Most users use it recreationally and only once in a while. A small part of users use it compulsively at some point in their lives.

The drug isn’t the problem, it lies in mental health. One in four people will suffer from a mental health issue during their lifetime.

Now, I don’t use drugs compulsively. I do it with friends sometimes. Sometimes I might light up a joint to unwind after work, and sometimes I take psychedelics, to expand my understanding of myself, and the world around me.

What I do at home harms doesn’t harm a single soul. What I do with my friend is nothing but bonding and fun. 

People should be allowed to do what they want, and even **if** it poses a risk, they should be allowed to do it, just as rock climbing or skydiving poses a risk.

I’d seriously like to expand my understanding of the arguments for why this shouldn’t be. We live in a world where it isn’t, and as such, I’d like to understand why.

Thank you.</original_post>

    <text>First of all, this should only apply to a house that you own.  That means no rent, no mortgage.  Nothing that ties it to another person or company.  After all, being in the safety of your own home means that you're not able to damage anyone else's property, and that means it must be *your* property, without anyone having a claim.

Now, how do we guarantee that you will **stay** in your home for the entire duration of the high (and following low)?  Do we get to board up all of the doors and windows?  Special padlocks on the outside of the house?  Straightjacket to make sure you don't go anywhere?  How would you implement this restriction?</text>

    <text>There already exist laws that make you pay damages to rental properties.  There are laws that punish you for doing 'bad' things outside. You don't need to also criminalize drugs.</text>
