    <title>CMV: there don't need to be hundreds of gender and sexuality names</title>
    <original_poster>YoungRecluse</original_poster>
    <original_post>I can understand gay, lesbian, queer, bisexual, asexual, pansexual, and aromantic. I can understand cis-, trans-, and a-genders. Why does there need to be demisexual and demiromantic and all that? Why do we need so many classifications of gender and sexuality? If you're attracted to the same sex, why can't you just be homosexual? If you're attracted to the opposite why can't you just be heterosexual? If you're attracted to both, why can't you be bisexual? Attracted to all? You're pansexual.
Keep it simple.

Also, I understand people getting offended and angry when they're misgendered, but getting angry doesn't really accomplish anything unless you can be calm in your education on the subject. Hating people for not calling you by your preferred pronouns the first time when they've never met you before is not going to accomplish anything. Hating cisgendered, heterosexual people will not accomplish anything. 

Please change my view.

    <text>Ok, so I'm going to try to address both points of your view. First regarding the need for all of these labels. A lot of other commenters are providing great analogies for descriptive labels and I'm going to let them handle that part. I simply argue that it is impossible for an outsider to see if more detailed labels are necessary or not. In the case of sexuality and/or gender the only people who can say how well of a fit a label is are the ones who apply it to themselves. They also happen to be the ones who notice whether or not it is useful in discourse, how easy it is to understand, and how readily accepted it is. So since the people who are using a label also have the most data on the pros and cons of it, it is wisest to trust in their decisions regarding the need for that particular term.

Now onto people who get angry when you use the wrong terms and/or pronouns. I'm guessing that you are conflating two (not mutually exclusive) groups, the people who are saddened and exasperated at people refusing to admit their authority when it comes to their own, personal identity, and then the people who blow up at people over misunderstandings. GSM (gender and sexual minorities) face a lot of willfully obtuse and needlessly cruel people. When people who are facing prejudice get angry anyone who feels unfairly targeted should practice empathy. Every now and then people will overreact to wrongdoings (this is true for all of life) and it is usually better to back off and fix the mistake instead of trying to argue what a reasonable reaction would be. Then there are the people who just blow up over misunderstandings, I have the fortune of only having met people with lots of patience regarding their labels, but I'm sure there exists assholes too. There are assholes within any group of people, GSM are no different. Do you think that over-labeling is specifically causing people to be jerks? I'd suggest Occam's Razor here, the explanation that some people are assholes is simpler than the one where over-use of labels cause people to be assholes.</text>
