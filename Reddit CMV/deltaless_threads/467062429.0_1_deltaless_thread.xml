    <title>CMV - President Trump's "shithole" comment about Haiti is not inaccurate, and because Haiti receives American aid, it should not complain</title>
    <original_poster>Petrus_</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'll focus strictly on Haiti for this.

Calling certain countries shitholes isn't incorrect. I'm not arguing Trump should've said it, but I am going to defend his assertion that Haiti is a shithole, and it shouldn't complain while it receives American aid.

Shithole is defined as:

A very dirty or unpleasant place

Haiti is a shithole, as it has widespread cholera, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, typhoid, and leprosy. All of these diseases are spread in unclean conditions, and all of these are unpleasant diseases, qualifying Haiti as a shithole. In addition, if you look at images of Haiti, the gutters are filled with garbage, the sanitation is horrible, or simply doesn't exist, and most of the country lives in squalor.

To compound this, Haiti is also extremely poor, with the average person getting $350 per year, which is ridiculously low, and can in no way be considered pleasant, further qualifying Haiti as unpleasant, and therefore a shithole.

My final point is that Haiti should not complain about calling a shithole (At least not without expecting some repercussions on it's aid), as it is both accurate, and it is receiving foreign aid to "fix" its problems. Each year, the United States spends $1.5 billion in Haiti (I've seen conflicting sources on the exact number, but the point still stands), which is a huge amount of money. In addition, the US provides 500k meals each day to Haitian students, so without the US, Haitians would be starving, so they shouldn't complain while we literally feed their kids.

Tldr: Haiti meets the definition of a shithole, by being both dirty and unpleasant, so Trump's comment was not inaccurate, and Haiti shouldn't complain by biting the hand that (Literally) feeds them.</original_post>

    <text>How would you define shithole then? We can't have a debate over a term you don't define.

And as for the second part of my argument, there's no comparison. A child *can* complain, but can expect to lose privileges or some other benefit. Why shouldn't a country? If you're unwilling to accept the treatment that comes with the aid/support, is it really worth it?

    <text>Well to me a shithole country would be a country with ZERO redeeming qualities. A country where every aspect of its culture, economy, natural scenery, people, religion etc is objectively terrible. No such country exists, so I'm not of the opinion that a 'shithole' country exists.

Yes there is very much a comparison. Your view is basically that financial dependence completely invalidates a person's right to complain about disrespect or mistreatment of any kind. That they should just take any and all accusations because they need to be supported. Why should aid come with disrespect? Are you seriously trying to argue that Haitians *have* to accept being disrespected in order to be helped? </text>

    <text>Well I'm using an established, dictionary supported definition, and to avoid the obvious bait of your second part of the first paragraph, I'm just going to ignore it.

That's not my view at all. They have every right to complain, but I believe it's in their best interest not to. I'm not saying that they have to do anything. They don't have to shut up and take it, *but* they don't have to receive our aid either. I'm not saying it should have to come with disrespect, but is it really worth risking losing aid over one comment?</text>

    <text>It's a subjective definition though. To add onto that, you need to prove that every part/aspect of Haiti is dirty/ unpleasant, otherwise your point is still moot. Btw the second part of the first paragraph is me stating that I don't think such a country exists, so whatever 'bait' you're referring to is beyond me.

Well you need to check your post. You did not say that it's not in their best interest to do so, you said that they shouldn't do so at all. 
Also why do you think the US is going to stop delivering aid to Haiti if their government/people expresses their concern over this comment? Do you think Trump pays them directly from his pockets? I don't get your reasoning.</text>

    <text>It could be construed you were trying to get me to call Haitians (Or any other nation), as a people, bad, or their religion, culture, etc, bad, to paint me as a shitty person and then simply discredit me as a racist. Misunderstanding on my part. 

I was saying best interest as a reply to your comment (I think about parents and children) if I remember correctly. I know how USAid works, but Trump could (however it would be unlikely), through executive order the State Department to stop sending them aid.

&amp;gt;every part/aspect of Haiti is dirty/ unpleasant, otherwise your point is still moot.

You don't need to prove every part of something meets a definition though, only most of it (Has *every* water molecule been checked in your water bottle? No? Is it still water?). The majority of the population lives in unpleasant, dirty, unsafe and otherwise bad conditions, so I still say it qualifies as a shithole.</text>

Sounds like your own insecurities playing out, so that's all on you. My point was that you'd have to only focus on certain aspects and ignore all the other pleasant aspects for your view to be remotely true.

&amp;gt;I know how USAid works, but Trump could (however it would be unlikely)

The risk you kept mentioning doesn't really exist. So the dichotomy you kept bringing up (either not complain about it or don't accept the aid/ expect it to be dropped) is entirely false. All in all just a bad argument.

&amp;gt;You don't need to prove every part of something meets a definition though, only most of it (Has every water molecule been checked in your water bottle? No? Is it still water?). 

This is a really poor analogy though.

Anyway, like I said, since this is a matter of opinion it's not really something that can be argued against. Like I said earlier, personally I consider only people who use terms like this in this way to be 'shitholes'. So while you might think Haiti qualifies, I don't. And while I might think *you* qualify, you probably don't. </text>

    <text>Yeah. It depends heavily on definition, and the analogy was poor. A better one would be a bag of popcorn, or something of the like. After putting it in the microwave, you can assume the corns popped, because that's the visible face of it, but without checking each kernel, you can't conclusively claim that it's done.</text>

    <text>In what world is it morally ok to insult someone with vulgarities (and keep in mind not only did he call Haiti a shithole, he said we shouldn't have allowed Haitians in the country in the first place because they come from a 'shithole', said we should get them out of here, and in a separate statement he asserted all Haitians have AIDS) and then withdraw aid if they complain about the disrespect and insensitivity towards their nation and its people? In what world is this not one of the most dick moves you could pull?</text>

    <text>I'm not making any claims about context, or whether it was appropriate to say. I didn't say we should withdraw aid, only that it could happen. </text>

  <comment id="30028235961.0" user="Love_Shaq_Baby" delta="False">
    <text>Well there is the fact that 

1) Withdrawing aid from Haiti for them standing up for themselves could easily backfire on Trump, worsening his public perception more than it helps him.

2) Haiti's leaders are under pressure to respond. To take an insult without any response would be perceived as a massive failure of leadership and it would cause a lot of Haitians to lose faith in them, which would be especially damaging considering Haiti is not exactly known for their elections being fair.</text>

What is the dictionary definition of "shithole" then? </text>
