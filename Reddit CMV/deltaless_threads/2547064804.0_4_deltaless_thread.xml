    <title>Cmv: Psychology is fucked up</title>

    <original_post>

Any major psychological study done mostly has involved unethical and morally questionable expirements behind it. Sure many good expirements have been done without harming any organism but that doesn't cause leaps in this department of science.


Things such as fear, isolation etc have only been studied by torturing and abusing many animals and humans in the past. The breakthroughs made then make psychology research today seem slow and less conclusive.


Take for example, Harlowâ€™s Pit of Despair or Stanford Prison Expirement or The Trolley Problem  or Milgrim's shocking obidence expirement.


Most will probably know these famous expirements because of their cruelty and discoveries unlike many good and positive expirements. 



It's ironical that the feild of study which needs to understand how the brain works needs a sacrifice of morals to progress quickly.</original_post>

    <text>Stanford Prison Experiment was ended as soon as the testers realized the "guards" were abusing their power

The shock test, no one was actually shocked

The trolley problem is a thought experiment, no one is actually hit with a trolley

Your misunderstanding of the experiments are a problem</text>

    <text>Trolley experiment was carried out by VSAUCE which was turned down by a universities ethics community.
No one was hurt but it proved my point that ethics have put a halt in innovation.


Stanford Prison Expirement was a highly studied and discussed one which led to many findings unlike the better Expirements done in comparison which allowed further innovation.

Shock test induced fear and was regarded as unethical by "ethics" committess around the world


I agree I am not very well versed but as a bystander my views were as follows</text>

As far as I can tell, no psychologists were involved in the VSAUCE gag. I don't think you can fairly condemn psychologists and the field of psychology for what some silly YouTube channel does.</text>

    <text>Just like myself condemning psychology as a field was over-generalisation. Isn't calling an entire channel sillly also rash?

As far as I know they were the first to ever do the trolley problem. At least wikipedia says so.</text>

Do you mean they were the first ever to enact the thought experiment  in real life? Something that was never intended? With no psychologists involved? How does that support your view?</text>

    <text>My view is the first statement you said. That yes they enacted it :


In 2017, a group led by Michael Stevens performed the first realistic trolley-problem experiment 


Now my view on bringing the trolley problem to light was that the unethical thought experiment that was supposed to be done with immoral standards would lead to innovation.


Of course, VSAUCE went the ethical route (which was still frowned on by ethics committees).</text>
