    <title>CMV: Public Schools should ONLY teach Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) { USA }</title>
    <original_poster>Mr-Homemaker</original_poster>
    <original_post>**BACKGROUND - SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE**: 

Public schools cannot endorse or promote any particular religious belief or practice, and must remain neutral on matters of religion.

In practical terms, this means that public schools cannot require or lead students in prayer, display religious symbols or materials, or promote any particular religious belief in the classroom. While public schools may teach about religion as part of a secular education, they must do so in an objective and neutral manner that does not endorse or promote any particular religious belief.

The rationale behind this is to protect religious freedom and prevent the government from imposing or favoring any particular religious belief or practice over others. It also recognizes that religion is a deeply personal and individual choice that should not be influenced or coerced by the government.

Overall, the separation of church and state is an important principle in the United States, and the Establishment Clause ensures that public schools remain neutral on matters of religion and respect the diverse beliefs and backgrounds of all students.

**APPLYING LOGIC TO HISTORY, CULTURAL STUDIES, AND LITERATURE:**

Given the increasing divisiveness in American society around history, cultural studies, and literature, it would be much cleaner and less contentious if we just agreed to pull those issues out of public curriculum as well.  

Parents - and whatever private institutions they want for their children - can teach children about history, culture, and literature with the time and money that public schools don't have to take up on it. (e.g. via vouchers)

Sure, there would be echo chambers and disinformation; but, the marketplace of ideas would eventually iron-out those wrinkles. Just as we can't legislate morality, neither can we legislate open-mindedness or critical thinking.  But that doesn't mean we can't have those things in society - it just means legislation and battles over curriculum isn't the place for it.

All the culture wars in the classroom are simply distracting from educational outcomes we actually want. And they aren't resulting in greater empathy or civil discourse - if anything, quite the opposite.

Certainly, there will be some equity issues (e.g. not all families or communities will have as much time or money to educate their children as others), but that isn't a sufficient reason to support the status quo, because *the system we have now suffers from those problems, too.*

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**: It seems that our society is becoming increasingly fractured and divisive.  I have a growing suspicion that the actual friction that results isn't because we don't see the world the same way - it's that we are fighting over whose view of the world will be taught in schools. So let's stop arguing about it and get on with our lives.

Ok. We'll teach spelling, grammar, etc.

But not literature

!delta

OH - good one - financial literacy deserves an honorable mention under the heading of math

....

Also OK: woodshop/metalshop/autoshop, cooking, music.....?

...

!delta
You're right - music is back OUT

Edit - examples of problems my proposed solution would make irrelevant: 

(1) LGBTQ+ Rights: The rights of LGBTQ+ students in public schools have been a controversial topic for years, with some individuals arguing that these students should be protected from discrimination, while others believe that promoting LGBTQ+ ideology in schools conflicts with their personal beliefs.

(2) Prayer in School: The debate over prayer in public schools has been ongoing for decades, with some individuals arguing that prayer is a fundamental part of their religious beliefs and should be allowed in schools, while others believe that public schools should be a secular space that is free from any religious influence or coercion.

(3) Texas Ten Commandments Law: The Texas legislature passed a law that allowed the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public schools and government buildings. This law sparked controversy, with some arguing that it violated the separation of church and state and was therefore unconstitutional, while others believed that it was an appropriate way to recognize the role of religion in American history and culture.

(4) Critical Race Theory: The teaching of Critical Race Theory in public schools has sparked controversy, with some individuals arguing that it promotes a divisive narrative regarding race and racism, while others argue that it is essential for understanding systemic oppression.

(5) Sex Education: Sex education in schools has been a controversial topic for years, with some parents arguing that it is not appropriate for schools to teach such material, while others believe that it is essential for students to receive comprehensive sex education.

Several people have argued that although my position is neutral, it would benefit their ideological opponents; and,
(1) they don't want an ideologically-neutral outcome;
(2) that they want to win the culture war; and
(3) therefore they don't want to end (avoid) the culture war

While I recognize people may hold beliefs that it is a good thing to win the culture war and for their ideology to be imposed on others, I just want to be honest that this is not a persuasive approach to "Change My View" - as I am against using the state to impose ideology on others.</original_post>

Not only is this a bad idea for countless other reasons but also, only teaching STEM would not stop the arguing.

When teaching STEM you still get loads of opportunity to teach or not teach different worldviews. Depending on what areas of STEM you choose to teach, how much you say and what exactly you say about it, for example:

1. Should sex ed be part of sc ience mm mm mm mm mm mm? I sure think so, for me in school it was a part of biology class which I think makes a lot of sense. If it IS taught a lot of people will find that in itself wrong, but also there will be the problem of how to teach it, what details and when. And if we DON'T teach sex ed as part of science that's political too! 

2. Should we teach evolution? It's science, a big and important part of biology but some people don't believe in it and don't want their kids learning about it. That opens up for even more questions such as should we teach about gravity, after all it's just a theory. Or maybe we should stop teaching about the earth being round since that conflicts with some peoples world view? 

3. What about environmental science? How much of this can be taught or omitted before it feels like a political decision that challenges people's world views? 

4. In any STEM subject do you get to teach about that subjects history? (We have to, it's part of the course) Or is that "not objective enough"? 

5. People would argue a lot about what ISN'T being taught. If we stopped teaching kids history, civics, arts, literature and the likes a lot of people would be very upset. Loads of the time people don't argue that something should or shouldn't be taught because they specifically don't want their child to learn or not learn it, but because they want ALL children to learn or not learn it. That kind of is the point of public education. I for one would be furious, protest and join movements, to reinstate those subjects, and I don't have kids.

So yeah, there's going to be arguments either way.</text>

    <text>But there are likely to be fewer arguments about less essential controversies.

You can't argue "if your proposal won't fix 100% of the problem, then it's invalid"</text>

    <text>I'm arguing that it wouldn't fix anything, it might slightly shift what's being said but not how much people will argue. It could just as likely start even more arguments especially due to point 5. 

To recap on point 5. Not teaching a subject is JUST as political as teaching it. Doing away with history, arts, civic, literature etc would ABSOLUTELY be hugely controversial and stir up a huge debate.

So again, I'm not arguing that it's not worth it because it wouldn't fix the problem 100%, I'm saying it's not worth it because it: Wouldn't fix the problem, likely would make the problem even worse and on top of that would create a whole load of new problems. 

That is to say:
 1(problem) &lt; 1(problem)*1,01+|x|(problem)</text>

    <text>It fixes 0% of the problem because people aren’t arguing because they’ve had an English class, it’s because people have visceral reactions and opinions about these topics and that won’t change.  Best case, we just shift to something else to get worked up about.  In fact it makes the situation worse because people will have less understanding of where we came from and how we got there. And have spent less time constructing well researched opinions.</text>
