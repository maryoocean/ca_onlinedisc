    <title>CMV: Legislative bodies should be required to explain, in formal writing, why they voted a certain way when it comes to legislation.</title>

    <original_post>I think publicly elected officials responsible for driving policy and legislation should be required to explain why they vote certain ways in writing. Voting along party lines is reprehensible regardless of the side. Politics shouldn't be a game about which side wins, but rather which fact-based opinions win regardless of sides. If the legislative bodies have no reasonable explanation for why they voted a certain way besides voting along party lines, they should not be allowed to vote because we have no reason to believe that they're not voting out of self-interest. If, for example, someone in Congress voted against what seems to be reasonable gun law without explanation, but you can see in their financial disclosure that the NRA contributes a lot of money and support for them, how are we to know that their vote was not influenced by the NRA without them explicitly citing so and explaining what other reason compelled them not to vote for said reasonable legislation? I'm not even asking for a long written response from them. A short paragraph or page summary with sources they're using to base their vote on is good enough. </original_post>

    <text>This just seems like a way to get a bunch of useless talking points. If the bill is in anyway controversial, all they have to do is say whatever their side is saying. You then learn absolutely nothing about them or their vote. To take your gun law example, all anyone who votes 'no' would have to do would be to say "I think this is an unconstitutional violation of the 2nd amendment". It wouldn't even matter whether they believed it or not.

I just don't see this as doing anything whatsoever to increase accountability. It would either be used for grandstanding or essentially ignored due to being useless. It's not like you're going to be able to determine who is and isn't lying or to compel them to tell the truth about their vote.</text>
