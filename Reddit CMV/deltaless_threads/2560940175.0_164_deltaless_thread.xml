    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>What else would we call ourselves? I had a German friend who took issue with our use of “American” and said we should be called “United Staters.” Setting aside how dumb that sounds, the USA is not the only United States in *The Americas.* It’s not even the only United States in North America. Mexico is officially the United Mexican States. So wouldn’t that make United Staters disrespectful to Mexicans?</text>
