    <title>CMV: I don't believe in punishment.</title>
    <original_poster>meur123</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't believe in punishment. I believe it's petty. I believe it does no good and only harm. As the old saying goes: "An eye for an eye makes the world blind." What does punishment actually achieve? If you kill somebody who killed somebody, it doesn't in any way bring them back. 

Look, I believe that we should have prisons, but not for punishment. The only reason to take away somebodies freedom is to prevent further harm to society. What has already been done is done. Prisons should focus instead on rehabilitation. If somebody is likely to cause harm to another, then it is necessary we take the means to prevent that. If they do not pose a danger, then it achieves nothing to take away their freedom.

**EDIT:** [I awarded a delta to someone that challenged the arguments of this final paragraph.](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/49fioa/cmv_i_dont_believe_in_punishment/d0regc3)

&amp;gt;Before you mention deterrence, I agree that we should aim to cut the problem out before it happens. Where I don't agree is that fear is an effective motivator. A much better solution would be to eliminate the conditions that coerce people into turning to crime.

Talking about deterrence was really tangential to the argument that I was actually making, and I was wrong to say that it is not in any way an effective tool.

But CMV, does punishment achieve anything for the greater good?

    <text>Prevent them from driving again.

Make them pay restitution.

If their behaviour cannot be fixed, then they should remain in jail.</text>

    <text>You keep them in in a cell till they are sober. You carefully explain to them what they have done, and allow them to think about what they have done. Obviously, you take away their licence. You give them therapy.

I would like to think that most people hold the moral view that murder is wrong. They're not gonna think "wow! I can literally get away with murder - let's do it again" and if you thought they did, then that would be the point in which incarceration would be necessary. </text>

    <text>No, it's similar to my scenario of locking someone up if they pose a threat. I'm not suggesting we take no action at all, what I'm suggesting is that retribution does not achieve anything.</text>

    <text>&amp;gt; what I'm suggesting is that retribution does not achieve anything.

 Of course it does. Retribution is catharsis. How could you say to that to the victimized or to their friends and loved ones? 

 There was a story recently in r/news about a man who burned his pregnant girlfriend alive because he didn't want the responsibility of being a father. He got 12 years in prison in Germany and there was some debate about whether or not this was acceptable. 

 Some people deserve to spend the rest of their life behind bars. They deserve it. Getting what you deserve, or as close as we can come to it, is progress to me. That's justice to me. I'm against the death penalty only because innocent people can die. For some thief who stole a tv he or she might deserve to go to prison for a year and be forced to learn a trade, earn a degree, be forced to become useful and productive. That seems just to me. That seems good for society. For a man who burned his pregnant girlfriend alive he deserves prison forever. His victim's family deserves for society to give him what *he* deserves.

    <text>essentially your hoping people are inherently good, this is not the case.  

for example a serial killer holds a toddler hostage, a cop sees it, his choices are to shoot the killer or let him leave unharmed with the toddler in which case the toddler will die,  

if he shoots he's essentially punishing him with death, if he doesn't he's effectively sentencing the toddler to death to avoid his own moral qualms by committing murder by proxy.

punishment isn't about what is morally right, because most know their crimes are not ok , they are about ensuring the safety of the rest</text>

    <text>Right, which is something that I stated in my OP. It's retribution that I take an issue with. When the cop shoots the serial killer, he's not doing it for retribution, he's doing it because it is going to cause the least harm in that moment at that time.

What would be punishment, is if the cop knew he had the ability to disarm or injure the serial killer, without further endangering the kid, and then shot him in the head anyway.</text>

    <text>Their deliberate actions did kill a person. 

Telling someone to go to their room and think about what they have done isn't the appropriate response to actions that killed a person. 

In fact, in many ways you are telling people that they can get drunk, drive and kill people and that nothing will happen to them so the next time they are in that situation there is simply no need for them to change any of their behavior. </text>

    <text>But you're acting like people need the law to be moral. It's the same as saying people need religion to be moral. If you are any kind of decent person you would learn a lot from that. And if you weren't, then yes you would need physical barriers from preventing you from doing that again.</text>

    <text>I'm acting like I live in a world where people often do things that aren't in the best interests of others. 

And actions do have consequences. If the consequence to driving drunk and killing people is getting a stern talking to then you will have more people driving drunk because the consequence is so small.

They decided to do something and that something had a consequence.

Last night, thousands of drunk people decided to call a friend or get a cab or Uber because they were worried about that consequence. 

Turn the consequence of DUI into something as mean as a stern talking to and you will have more people justify driving drunk. </text>

    <text>It isn't just a natural consequence. Legislators wrote the laws. Police made arrests. A jury found them guilty and a judge laid down a sentence. Prison guards see that they don't escape. People are making choices to establish and enforce these laws at every step of the way.

To drive the point home: laws can change. Being detained and sentenced isn't just something that happens all by itself, and the rules we enforce are also subject to bending and rewriting.</text>

This isn't some edict from a dictator. 

If we treat DUI like we would a 15 year old who broke curfew we going to have a lot more DUI's.

That makes no difference. My point was that the consequence is not natural, but imposed. The rules are made by people and enforced by people. Different rules can exist. You seemed to imply that it was as simple as "Break rule: receive punishment":

&amp;gt;You aren't sending them to jail.

&amp;gt; They decided to do something and that something had a consequence.

All I'm saying is that people are involved. It isn't just cause and effect—people in the middle are making choices about how to enforce these things.

&amp;gt;If we treat DUI like we would a 15 year old who broke curfew we going to have a lot more DUI's. 

Nowhere did I suggest we do this.</text>

    <text>You didn't but the OP seems to want to do that exact thing. 

Consequences are simply consequences. Natural or enforced by a state. There are still consequences to behavior and those consequences do govern behavior. </text>

I accept this but you seem to be saying that without *harsh* punishments, the behaviour won't be adequately governed. I'd add that while punishment has its place, reinforcement of good behaviour with praise or reward is more effective than punishment of bad behaviour in modifying how people act. Tapping into sincere motivation is even better still.

That all said, fuck drunk drivers. Revoke their licenses for a year upon being caught and make them pay for reparations if they damage anything. If they injured someone, revoke their licenses indefinitely. If they killed someone, put them away.</text>

    <text>As I said, punishment has its place. As a deterrent and for restoration and to quarantine. But to clarify, I think it should be used as a last resort, when the shit hits the fan and may again. In parenting, management, teaching, and other places where authority guides behaviour, preference should be given to reinforcement or authentic motivation. Thou-shalt-nots with punishments are a sloppy way to manage peoples' behaviour, and often results in two-way resentment, or worse.</text>

    <text>When a driver gets drunk and decides to drive anyway and kills someone the shit has hit the fan. 

The idea, be in parenting or such, is to connect the behavior to the consequences of that behavior. And often, if the consequences don't match the behavior then you can lead to more of that behavior happening. The consequence does have to be sufficient for the behavior. </text>

    <text>This argument brings up a really good point to me. I think that whether they kill someone, injure someone, or just get caught before anything happens shouldn't make a difference to the action that the law takes. In any scenario, the perpetrator *could* have killed someone. Since my view of the law is based on *what level of threat someone currently poses* rather than what has already happened that cannot be changed.</text>

Driving a car *at all* means you could kill someone in traffic way more easily than taking other modes of transit. Same goes for walking an anxious dog, or training in karate. If you started charging people for crimes just based on increased *threats* to other people instead of actual consequences, you'd be handing out fines for a lot of innocuous activities.</text>

    <text>let's assume you don't get blackout drunk, you just fall asleep at the wheel. case A: you run over someone and kill him, case B: you run into some bushes and merely scratch your car. the difference between the two cases is *pure chance*. is it ok that in case A you go to prison and in case B you get patted on the back?</text>
