    <title>CMV: "Retard" is not an offensive or ableist word because the connotation has changed from referring to mentally handicapped people to referring to stupid people, much like how the meaning of other words like "dumb" and "lame" have also changed meanings dramatically.</title>

    <original_post>So a lot of people find the word "Retard" used as an insult to be incredibly offensive, akin to saying the n-word to a black person. They say that this is because historically the word means mentally handicapped person and it was used in a patronizing and derogatory way during a time when there was a massive cultural stigma and disgust with mental disabilities. 

Yet, many words over the course of history change. Hell, a lot of the words we use today to refer to someone as an idiot - including the word idiot - were historically used to describe mentally ill/handicapped people. 

To this day, words like Imbecile, Moron and Cretin are used to describe stupid people (or troublemakers, in the case of cretin), yet these words actually mean the exact same thing as "retard". 

So why is retard singled out as "ableist"? Are people who take offence to the word simply being resistant to the natural evolution of language, or does their anger have merit? 

EDIT: Everyone made very good points. I'm considering them, but based on the fact that for the most part I had *nothing* to fire back with, I'd say my views have been thoroughly changed and I'm going to phase this word out of my vocabulary. I'm guilty of frequent use - it's easy to just turn to a buddy and say that in good fun without even thinking, but I'll be mindful in the future. 

Thanks people. Also You get a delta, you get a delta, and you get a delta, everyone gets a delta!!!!!

    <text>That word will always be associated with people who have disabilities. It's far more serious of a word than imbecile, moron, or cretin, even though those have historically been more offensive than we think they are now. In no way do they mean the same thing as the word retard, and thinking that they do mean the same thing is part of the problem. Calling someone or something stupid just isn't on the level of likening something to a mentally disabled person. Hearing it is just one more thing that makes people and children with disabilities think that they're lesser people because of their conditions, especially since the term "mentally retarded" had been considered the proper term to describe someone with a disability up until recently.

    <text>I can somewhat see your point, but stating that it is far more serious is only true in our current society. The words literally originally had near-identical meanings - specifically, they refer to general learning disability or Intellectual Development Disability. 

You think that it will always bear this association because this term is somehow harsher than it's predecessors, but is there any historical evidence to suggest that it has been used to facilitate abuse and oppression of disabled peoples any more than previous words with this definition? </text>
