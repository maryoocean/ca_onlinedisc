    <title>Judging women for revealing clothing is perfectly acceptable, and should not be considered slut shaming. CMV.</title>

    <original_post>For the most part, when people talk about slut shaming they are speaking of shaming a woman for having 'too many' sexual partners. While I side with the majority on that one, and think slut shaming in that context is wrong, that message is also often accompanied by the declaration that women should be able to dress and act however they want and not be shamed for that either. In my mind those are two completely separate things. 

Being promiscuous is often seen in feminists movements for women as being confident in their sexuality. However when I see women in revealing attire, especially posted on social media such as Facebook and Instagram, I don't think they are being sex positive at all. I think they are trying their hardest to get attention. 

In the same vein, my feelings towards SlutWalk are pretty negative. For those who have not heard of it, SlutWalk was a worldwide protest initiated when a Toronto cop told a group of students that to avoid rape they should avoid dressing like "sluts". The idea of it is that women should be able to wear whatever they want and not be considered slutty. In my opinion, as offensive as that cop's comment may have sounded, it really is good, practical advice. Common sense tells you that if you go into the street in a tight dress and fishnets you've put yourself in a more dangerous situation that if you go out in a hoodie and sweats. 

Moreover, the idea that anyone should be able to wear anything without being judged seems ridiculous. Your clothes and appearance are often the only information strangers know about who you are. They communicate basic preferences. The two above mentioned outfits say two different things about the people wearing them. Yes, it's true that wearing a revealing outfit doesn't mean you're sexually promiscuous, and may not fully warrant being called a slut. But in my mind it does mean you are trying to garner attention of sexual interest through your clothing which is more than enough for me to pass judgment. For reference, I am a young woman who is mostly liberal minded, and this is probably the most 'radical' view I hold. </original_post>

    <text>What sort of judgement do you plan on passing on women who are wearing revealing clothes, besides "they wanted to reveal their assets"?  How do you plan on acting on this judgment?  I'm going to repeat something I said in a similar thread to this, and ask how it could possibly benefit you to judge whose choice of attire doesn't particularly suit you.

Additionally, while /u/Amablue [edit: and everyone else whose posted as of now] as a great point about rape by strangers, I have a different problem with

Even if that *were* good, practical advice, why should we be content with living in that kind of social climate?  How can you possibly justify the idea that your choice of clothing could lead to a direct violation of you bodily autonomy?  It's one thing to be unsurprised, but to be against the idea of changing this?  To bear not only apathy towards the status quo, but *antipathy* towards the idea that it should be changed for the better?</text>
