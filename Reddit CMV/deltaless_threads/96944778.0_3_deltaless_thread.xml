    <title>Childless adults should not go to Disneyland and Disneyworld. These are for children and families, and adults have the entire world to experience. CMV.</title>

    <original_post>As an adult of moderate means, you have access to the adventures and experiences that Disneyland (and related parks) simulate. You can go whitewater rafting, tour Czech castles and Parisian catacombs and sail the actual Caribbean. Disneyland is obviously an amusement targeted at children, and so adults without children should seek alternative forms of entertainment.

As a more practical addendum to the above, I gather that Disneyland and other parks are exceptionally busy, often resulting in long lines for the attendees. If adults without children eschewed them, then they'd actually be enriching the experience for the parks' target audience.

EDIT (Sept. 4, 19:00 CET): I'm afraid I'm out of time to respond to other comments--thanks for the conversation.</original_post>

    <text>Since when is it the responsibility of one consumer to enrich the experience of another consumer?  

Whitewater rafting, touring Czech castles, touring Parisian catacombs, and sailing in the Caribbean aren't options for most adults.  Most adults might be able to do one of those things per year at best, each of them costing 1-5 years worth of saving (with the exception of whitewater rafting.  Meanwhile, a couple without children can scrounge up $250, see replicas of all that, watch parades, fireworks, hear live music, see live theater shows, eat at restaurants in the park, ride a few rides, and enjoy a little nostalgia from their own childhood years all in one day. 

I don't know about Disney World, but Disneyland does stop selling tickets, once the park reaches a certain capacity.  If it weren't full of childless adults, it would be full of more children, and the lines would be just as long.  If childless adults stopped buying tickets would Disney eat that lost revenue, or charge more to make it up?  I'd bet they would up the ticket price.

I can find the quote if you want, but Walt Disney said that he built Disneyland for children and adults alike.  Watch any Disney movie as an adult and you will know that children are not the only target audience of Disney products.  They are just the primary target.  Kids don't have a monopoly on silly fun.</text>
