    <title>CMV: Most people are not well read enough to reasonably advocate for political or economic change</title>

    <original_post>**Edit: "Well read" was a poor choice of words. I think "have done their due diligence" might be more accurate.**

I'm writing this because I want to be proven wrong, because people saying political things, especially as if obvious has started to annoy and anger me more. Especially if they're making fun of someone for their political views, even if I disagree with those views. I hate feeling angry, so hopefully writing my thoughts out will help.

In trying to figure out my own political views, I've come to realize that I can't reasonably hold the views I held, or any other views. I studied economics, mainly the school of thought that appealed to me. But then more and more I came to realize that I couldn't say if the Keynesian or post-keynesian or the Chicago school or MMT etc. were correct, and that even people who devote their lives to the study of economics struggle with the same thing. The same thing happened in philosophy, especially as I came to realize the importance of epistemology and ontology.

And you can't reasonably expect people to put in the effort and time that it takes to sort through these fields. And that there is still such debate among the experts that even if you become and expert, the truth will not be obvious. I've come to understand what Socrates meant when he said something like "I only know that I know nothing".

I've also come to believe that people hold the beliefs they do more for social reasons. Less for the truth of the beliefs, but more because their reaffirm their identity, and their social bonds.

I can't blame them for that, or for not spending thousands of hours sorting through political thought, philosophy and economics. But a part of me still believes that they haven't done their due diligence, and I get angry that they can affirm themselves and their beliefs, while I sit here uncertain, unable to succinctly articulate why, or how to get this across properly.</original_post>

    <text>Since most positions come from some expert or another, all that laypeople really have to do is to figure out which experts to trust the most. They can do this by seeing what other experts say, or by looking at the success of their work.

The social group issue that you bring up comes from this, possibly. People rely on their social group and community to decide which experts to trust. Likely someone in that group is an expert and is able to judge the circumstances. 

People usually advocate for change based on the opinions of people who have thought about the issue in depth. Conservatives can point to Milton Friedman, and his Nobel Prize and acceptance in economic academia, and liberals can point to Paul Krugman with the same. 

If it was any other way, no one would ever be able to do anything. For example, you wouldn't be able to eat macaroni in case it was toxic or dangerous, and you just didn't know the biochemistry of macaroni. If people do that, they can base their political and economic opinions on reasonable grounds.</text>
