    <title>CMV: Every Disney Princess could be reasonably interpreted as a metaphor for mental illness or diagnosed as having one</title>
    <original_poster>DaisyChained23</original_poster>
    <original_post>Examples:

Belle- Stockholm Syndrome. Also maybe NPD (the scene where the villages are singing about how beautiful and special she is could be seen as a grandiose delusion).

Rapunzel - Anxiety (her "tower" is a mental one) and PTSD from an abusive mother.

Elsa and Anna- BPD. Anna is impulsive and reckless and doesn't really have a clear sense of identity. Elsa is impulsive in a different way and cold. They could be seen as two sides of "splitting".

Ariel- body dysphoria. She literally changes the entire lower half of her body.</original_post>

    <text>No, they can't be "reasonably interpreted". Why?  
In most of those cases you can't establish a recurring pattern of behavior, you can not check for physical conditions explaining said behavior, you don't have all the context of the situation (we learn extremely little of how exactly the world and society in those films actually work) and can't communicate directly with the patient.  
All of them could also be interpreted to just be high as fuck and delusional. Or dreaming.</text>
