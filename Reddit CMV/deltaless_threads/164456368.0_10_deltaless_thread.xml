    <title>CMV: Jesus is not that unique of a figure</title>
    <original_poster>CantPenTheSnowden</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've always wondered why people are so obsessed with this Jesus character.

His messages are not unique, in fact they are rather common knowledge, except for the few clever sayings that are attributed to him. Feed the poor, don't let your heart be consumed with wealth and material goods, believe in a higher power, do unto others what you want others to do to you etc. are all common sayings that were preached by hundreds of sages before and after the life and death of Jesus. 

I think of Jesus as being another charismatic figure whose death or martyrdom was made into a legend by his followers in order to legitimize Christendom. I mean what other fashion can you justify genocide, bigotry and forced conversion other than proclaiming that your message is about peace and love? This sort of doublethink astounds me.

    <text>you seem to be unaware of how insane of an influence Jesus has had on the world. there isn't a single person who has been more influential than Jesus in all of recorded history, whether you believe in his teachings or not. 

your claim that he is not unique is like when people claim that The Beatles were not unique because there is so much music comparable to them today. that leaves out the fact that they were the ones who influenced that music and that's why it is comparable. at the time The Beatles were pretty out there and that's why they have such a mark on history. at the time of Jesus, the stuff he was saying, which seems uninspired today was crazy stuff.</text>
