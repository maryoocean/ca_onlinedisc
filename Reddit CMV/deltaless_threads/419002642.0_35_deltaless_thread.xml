    <title>CMV: American cities are terribly designed and administered compared with European cities.</title>
    <original_poster>bostoninwinston</original_poster>
    <original_post>Most American cities are terrible compared to European ones. I'm not talking about big cities like NYC or SF- I mean the typical- the average- American city- is just awful by any objective comparison. You can go to out of the way cities in Italy or France, Germany or Belgium, and they build places as though their great-grandchildren would be proud to live there. Here, the average city has no city center, major monuments, or sense of history. In the US. there are few places to gather. The social life of American cities is incomparably lifeless compared to European cities. Our Cities are heavily segregated by race and economic class in the way European cities aren't. The architecture here is mostly corporatist modernism, and looks cookie-cutter. It quickly gets dated in the way the art of European cities don't. People here have to get around by car, and as a result are fatter and live shorter lives than the average European. Our unhealthiness contributes to our under-productivity. The average European city is vastly more productive than the average American one â€“ despite Europeans having dramatically more benefits, time off, vacations in, and shorter work hours on average. We damage our environment far more readily than European cities do. Our cities are designed often in conflict with the rule areas that surround them, whereas many European cities are built integrated into their environment. We spend more money on useless junk thank Europeans do. Our food isn't as good quality. Our water is often poisoned with lead and arsenic, and our storm drainage systems are easily overrun compared to European water management systems.  European cities are managing rising seas and the problems related to smog far better than American cities are. 

I can't think of a single way in which American cities are broadly speaking superior to European ones. Change my view.</original_post>

    <text>I disagree. Being an island doesn't protect you from creating low density sprawl. New York had rules that allow developers to build as tall as they want, as densely as they wanted, with any flexible mix of commercial, residential, and other uses. They let you build up to the property line. They didn't mandate parking be provided. These are truly exceptional rules compared with most of the USA.

Theoretically they could build one giant 12-lane Parkway that stretches the whole length of Manhattan, covered each side with strip malls, And by zoning required that everyone set their house back at least 15 feet from the street, and only build single-family homes that can be no taller than 25 ft tall and must be set back at least 30 feet from the side and back property line. That would require minimum lot sizes bigger than many parts of manhattan. That would've meant that the island of Manhattan would have been zoned like many suburban sprawl the areas of the United States, and would look a lot more like the rest of the United States. In these ways, manhattan is in fact not typical, and I've not made a "no true scottsman" fallacy.</text>
