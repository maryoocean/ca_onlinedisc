    <title>CMV: The Republican party could guarantee a victory in the next election if they would reach out to labor unions.</title>

    <original_post>While Ronald Reagan was a very anti-union president, the Democratic party championed for labor. But in recent history Bill Clinton drafted NAFTA. With the Democratic support of Outsourcing USA Jobs and now open borders they lost a tremendous amount of loyal supporters. The AFL-CIO is a massive lobby group with one of the largest voter support of any but they saw their support fractured in the last election because of policies pushed by the Democratic Party, and the effects of the democratic economy. Forcing an American worker to compete with illegal wages, and with third world wages is not Labour friendly and loyal Democratic voters are leaving because they haven't seen a return for all their loyal support. Change my view.....</original_post>

    <text>If the GOP took up unions, they'd lose the support of the people who fund their campaigns.  They'd also lose all the people who've bought in to the "Unions steal your money and give it to Democrats" rhetoric they've been shouting for a few decades.

Unions fight for regulation.  They fight for the _group_ over the individual.  They fight against the corporate owners who want to save every penny by bending or breaking rules. That's why the GOP has been doing their best to hamstring or undermine them for so long.</text>
