    <title>CMV: Hillary Clinton is unfit for presidency.</title>
    <original_poster>Professorjack88</original_poster>
    <original_post>I believe that Hillary Clinton is unfit for the presidency because she is corrupt, a liar, and a hypocrite.

1. Hillary Clinton is corrupt. She or her husband routinely [have taken money from companies](http://downtrend.com/robertgehl/oops-bill-clinton-says-he-accidentally-took-500000-from-algeria-during-key-arms-negotiation-with-state-department), that they then go on to give government contracts. [One of her largest donors was given a spot on the nuclear advisory board, with no experience at all.](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/clinton-had-donor-as-nuclear-security-adviser.html) She will not release her speech transcripts, which hints at the fact that Hillary may have told them something that she doesn't want to get out. Whether it be corruption or something else; she is hiding something.



2. Hillary Clinton is a hypocrite and a liar. She takes huge sums of cash from wall street, and then says that she is going to breakup the banks. She says that she is a women's rights activist, and yet takes millions from countries like Saudi Arabia. I haven't even mentioned Hillary's flip flopping on all sorts of her campaign issues, and described in [this](http://imgur.com/Ls3B6n1) image. You can see her whole platform change in response to Bernie Sanders. She seems to say anything to get elected.

Based on all this, how can people support her? The facts are right there, and yet Hillary continues to get many votes. Is there something that I'm missing? It seems as if the second she gets in office she will support the big donors that she has pledged against. Throughout this whole thing, I haven't yet talked about Hillary's email scandal. She held secret government files on a server that was *hacked multiple times.* If someone could show me the reasons to support Hillary that would be great.

    <text>Your second point doesn't show "flip flopping". Politicians should be free to change their minds, as should every intelligent person. Changing your mind shows that you have put serious thought into the issue. "Flip flopping" is only an issue if they keep changing their mind whenever it suits them. Changing it once is sensible. A lot of people who initially supported the Iraq war were later against it.

Being able to admit you were wrong is the sign of intellectual maturity, hence this entire subreddit.</text>

Without saying Bernie, because he already lost. Yeah, he'd probably have been a better option, but it's pointless to say that now. </text>

    <text>I don't know that Bernie would've been better, and this coming from someone who voted for him. Over and over he showed himself to be, at the very least, stubborn and difficult to work with, so Dems in Congress (assuming that they could've taken it back) would be hard pressed to really work with him. More than that, economic analysis of his campaign promises often showed them to be unsustainable or unrealistic; not a good sign. Plus, the reason he polled strongly against Trump is because no political ammo has been used against him until now, while Hillary has been getting attacked for almost 25 years now.

    <text>Well, as a Hillary supporter, I think Bernie did a lot, particularly on campaign financing.  I think it opens the door to serious reform because Democrats know they can win without corporate money and I'm not sure they knew that before.  Hillary was playing by the standard rules on fundraising; Bernie showed it is might be possible to CHANGE the rules.

    <text>...as did basically every progressive politician in America. If someone is over forty years old, there was probably a time in their life when they were against gay marriage. 

It should be noted that even before she was openly for gay marriage, she was unusually supportive of the LGBT community. I'm on mobile, but look up Barney Frank's comments on her involvement with pride in 2000. </text>

I don't think it does, inherently. 

&amp;gt; Clinton is no worse or better 

Basically most people feel their vote comes down to the lesser of two evils, with that in mind, when selecting among the pool of candidates you should exclude the *least* principled. I mean, wouldn't you say your record is important? And the more principled you are makes you a more trustworthy and thus, qualified candidate? 

Don't get me wrong, I'm voting for her, but there are good arguments to be made that she is less qualified than others. The bar this cycle is set so low, though, that she stands as the only reasonable option. </text>

    <text>Changing some positions and having principles aren't mutually exclusive. I'd argue that Hillary Clinton's guiding principles have [stayed quite consistent over the years](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-was-liberal-hillary-clinton-is-liberal/), regardless of various details which may have shifted.

And on the other hand, even politicians like Bernie Sanders, who I'm guessing you'd include in the "principled" category, make many of the same shifts over time that mainstreamers like Hillary do. 

It's a question of what role different politicians choose to play in the political scene. Sanders chose to be, in essence, a fringe member, which gave him a great deal more freedom in the positions he could take but also compromised his influence pretty greatly. Hillary, and others like Obama, Bill Clinton, etc., chose to go for more major, leadership-oriented positions with the knowledge that this stature requires one to be, as I said, a politician in the truest sense of the word. I don't take pleasure in seeing dishonesty from HRC et al., and in fact, it does seem that she sometimes plays it a bit *too* safe in terms of her issue positions. But at the end of the day, I think there's ample evidence that she's a fundamentally trustworthy person, and that those who demonize her tend to lack understanding of context and history.</text>

    <text>The political reality in American politics is that you can't just be directly honest about certain things because you are giving ammunition to your opponents.  Hillary changed her mind on gay marriage.  She knows she changed her mind on gay marriage.  We know she changed her mind on gay marriage.  But if she says directly in an interview "I changed my mind on gay marriage" then her opponents will hammer her with that soundbite over and over, and certain voters will change their minds because of it.</text>

    <text>It was a different time. I remember back in the early 90s I was for civil unions rather than gay marriage, although I am a supporter now--is rather us drop the "gay" in that term sooner than later. My argument was that civil union would gain more traction nationwide by distinguishing it from marriage as traditionally between a man and a woman. Before being for civil unions (then gay marriage) in the 80s I was perplexed even by the idea of homosexuality. Holding Hillary, or any long term public servant, up as disingenuous for evolving with the debate will only serve to entrench more public servants and keep them from evolving. </text>

Many people feel that's a shot against her but I don't. The LGBT movement has become a key part of the party now. Democrats will fight for gay rights, and the fact that she is so establishment only means she'll fight harder. How she got there, when she got there, that doesn't matter to me. Honestly that's just politics, and we all agree that she's not exactly smooth in that regard. I give her a break on that.

    <text>[I'm not sure many younger people realize that the current "status quo" in terms of how society in general treats LGBT people is very recent, and is really an amazing change from when I was growing up in the 80s and 90s, a time where in most parts of the US two guys or two girls would not walk down the street hand in hand or openly display affection for each other. People still were being prosecuted under state sodomy laws.
It was a big deal when Star Trek: DS9 had two female characters actually kiss each other on screen.
The third season of Real World on MTV in 1993 had a gay house member, Pedro Zamora, who had HIV and was in a relationship with another man. Do you have any idea how unusual it was at the time to show a same-sex relationship \(let alone two men, let alone HIV-positive\)? It was unheard of.
Don't Ask Don't Tell and the Defense of Marriage Act were actually wins for the LGBT community. The fact that they're looked at negatively now is a testament to how far LGBT rights have come in the last twenty years.
And I find it ironic that the 2004 video clip of Hillary Clinton saying that she believes marriage is between a man and a woman \(that has been used to say she was against gay marriage\) is actually from a speech in which she was speaking out against a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Had that amendment actually been passed, the recent SCOTUS ruling that in effect legalized same-sex marriage would not have been possible, since the justices rule based on what's in the Constitution. DOMA was a bone thrown to conservatives to keep them away from something that, once done, would be enormously difficult to undo.
People who claim Clinton \(or anyone else on the left\) was "against gay marriage" really don't understand the last twenty or thirty years insofar as LGBT rights are concerned. Focusing on the issue of "gay marriage" pretty much misses the point.](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4pso93/cmv_hillary_clinton_is_unfit_for_presidency/d4nluhs)</text>

    <text>Are you disappointed she changed her position?

If you are, keep in mind she supported the TPP (1) when it was in very early stages of negotiation and (2) when she was an employee of the Obama administration and Obama, her boss, was pushing HARD in favor. In my opinion, it's rarely a good idea to undermine your own leader and organization in public. Instead, you present a united front in public and settle disputes in private. 

When Hillary was no longer SoS, she said she didn't support or oppose the TPP bc she didn't know what was in it because she had been out of office for some time. Once she knew what was in it, she opposed. That seems reasonable to me. </text>

To clarify I doubt she's going to stop supporting gay marriage because there is nothing to gain from it but I'm certain she will still do whatever her donors want on trade deals to bone the middle class.  I'm also pretty sure that if she stated any non interventionist positions she would change her mind instantly.

As for the email thing, if you wanted to jail her you'd have to jail the entire Bush Administration, because they did all their business, including things related to national security, on RNC servers.

I think what she did is worse then what Snowden did by quite a bit, but because she is a clinton/poltiician shes not getting shit on for it when she should be.

As for the protectionism shit, I will look it up more since I admit a large degree of ignorance on it.  I remember people going nuts about the TPP deal being secretive and fucked up.

I think clinton is also a war criminal.  There was something released recently in those guccifer papers about how hillary was one of the major people trying to manipulate us into going into syria.

She's a liar, a warmonger, and there is nothing you can trust about her except that she will do anything for her big donors.  You can look at that shit with Elizabeth Warren where Clinton met with her and shot down some bankrupty bill while her husband was president, then as soon as she became a senator she approved it because of big money.  She stands on no principles at all and is going to keep us going down the Obama route.

I'd rather 4 years of trump than 8 years of hillary.  She deserves nothing and the establishment of both parties need to understand that they can't get there way continuing to act against the interest of the people and being bought by corporations.  

To conclude, I know what type of soulless politician clinton is, and I don't know what type trump is.  The republicans are all terrible as well so they won't be able to win in 2020, so I'd rather another chance for bernie or some other sensible person in 4 years.

    <text>&amp;gt;I have no issue jailing the whole bush administration.

Not even gonna touch that

&amp;gt;You want to go hard on whistleblowers then you should get the same treatment.

And if pigs flew we'd all carry umbrellas. I oppose the NSA spying thing to, but what the did you *think* was gonna happen? The feds were just gonna say "aww, you got us. We're spying on everyone, but you got us fair and square."

&amp;gt;I think what she did is worse then what Snowden did by quite a bit, but because she is a clinton/poltiician shes not getting shit on for it when she should be.

The email thing was a mistake, sure. A mistake that plenty of other politicians have made as well. The charges are entirely politically motivated and the "investigation" nothing more than a fruitless witch hunt

&amp;gt;I think clinton is also a war criminal. There was something released recently in those guccifer papers about how hillary was one of the major people trying to manipulate us into going into syria.

If you think every president and every member of the executive branch since FDR isn't a war criminal by some stretch, you're in for a world of disappointment.. All wars are crimes.
If we'd intervened in Syria sooner, at the very least we could have cut a deal where the Assad government shares power with a rebel group and Bashar skips town to Moscow or something. Let be be quite clear in saying that there are no good guys in the region, just bad and worse. I trust Hillary to do everything in her power to make sure its not the worse guys.

&amp;gt;She's a liar, a warmonger, and there is nothing you can trust about her except that she will do anything for her big donors.

She adjusts with the times, she plays the game the way the rules are laid out, and she believes in a strong defense- and offense when necessary. Her vote in 2003 was to authorize military force, not go to war immediately. The Senate was promised that the authorization was to be leverage to coerce Saddam into cooperating. Instead, the Bush Administration went all cowboy cop on Iraq. She, just one of 75 senators who voted in favor, cannot be solely blamed.

&amp;gt;You can look at that shit with Elizabeth Warren where Clinton met with her and shot down some bankrupty bill while her husband was president, then as soon as she became a senator she approved it because of big money.

She approved it because it was more lenient than the initial proposal. So lenient, in fact, that between House Republicans that opposed a milquetoast bill and House Democrats who considered it too punitive, it failed to pass the House.
You notice that in 2005 when the bill came up again but passage through the House was assured, she voted against the bill.
I know the Bernie Bros are about as willing to compromise as the Tea Party, but its how Congress works. 

&amp;gt;She stands on no principles at all

And this is based on the wild success of politicians who compete at the national level but never waver on principle. Oh, how difficult it must have been for Bernie to stick to his principles in the most liberal state in the country. You notice the one issue where he bucks the typical liberal orthodoxy is on guns, in a very pro-gun state? Coincidence, I'm sure.

&amp;gt;and is going to keep us going down the Obama route.

Low unemployment, low gas prices, the longest stretch of peacetime economic growth in history, social progress on a number of fronts, increased awareness of racial disparities, the seeds of prison and sentencing reform, growing support for marijuana legalization, the toughest financial regulations since the New Deal, 20 million more insured, etc? that "Obama route,'' do you mean?

&amp;gt;I'd rather 4 years of trump than 8 years of hillary. She deserves nothing and the establishment of both parties need to understand that they can't get there way continuing to act against the interest of the people and being bought by corporations.

    <text>I shouldn't of even bothered continuing to read after you tried to call the email server a mistake.  You don't mistakenly pay someone to build a private server in your home.  That's a conscious decision.  There were plenty of regulations and rules that made it clear that she shouldn't be doing that.  When you are a multi millionaire lawyer ignorance isn't an excuse because I'm sure someone told her "that's not a good idea" along the way.

By doing that she jeopardized national security as evidenced by Wikileads, Russia, and Guccifer(s) having access to all/most of her emails.  You can say Russia is lying, but I doubt Wikileaks is.  I don't recall them lying about stuff like that.

You can hold someone accountable for there action relating to Iraq if that's what you want.  you say 74 other senators did it too, the issue is that those 74 aren't also running for president therefore they aren't a point of focus.  They would be subject to the same grievance. 

You can trash sanders or whoever for sticking to there positions on principle but I don't know how you can view that as bad.  Just because they aren't generally successful in major elections doesn't mean that trait isn't desirable.  I don't know how you can dismiss someone for being trustworthy.   The 'game' that you speak of is a disgusting joke.  The future of our country and our world shouldn't be viewed as some sort of adversarial game, just like our justice system shouldn't be.  Just because it is doesn't mean I need to accept that at face value.  

Bernie's position on guns could very well stem from his belief about guns and whatever he has read/learned on guns over the years.  I'm not convinced that guns should be fully restricted in our country and I suppose he isn't either.  

Say all the stuff about Obama you want, I've expressed the major issues I had with his administration, namely the complete lack of transparency, the 8 years of war, and his wonderful war on whistleblowers.

He also didn't stop the feds from trying to crack down on legal marijuana and medical was approved in California.  I specifically remember dispensaries being raided and it being a point of contention.

That's a cute quote you got there.  I don't believe in voting for the lessor of two evils.  Evil is evil.  It's like would you rather I stab you to death, or shoot you in the head?  Both are terrible, one is likely more prolonged and painful, but at the end of the day they are both bad.  It's not as though hilldog is 50% good 50% evil and trump is 99% evil.  They are both atrocious human beings.

But hey man, I will certainly take your advice about not voting come November.  </text>

It was a fuckup. It was a poor decision. That being said, we have *zero evidence* that anything classified or relevant to national security was stolen. In the wild world of politics, this is about the least important thing you could be focusing on

&amp;gt;You can hold someone accountable for there action relating to Iraq if that's what you want. you say 74 other senators did it too, the issue is that those 74 aren't also running for president therefore they aren't a point of focus. They would be subject to the same grievance.

Authorization for military force (which is what the vote was for. The vote was not "to invade or not to invade") was intended to be leverage to coerce iraq into cooperating. If there's anything you can fault her for, its not believing that George Bush could be as retarded enough to invade. 

&amp;gt;You can trash sanders or whoever for sticking to there positions on principle but I don't know how you can view that as bad. *Just because they aren't generally successful in major elections doesn't mean that trait isn't desirable.* I don't know how you can dismiss someone for being trustworthy.

You call it being trustworthy, I call it being rigid. Sticking to your guns doesn't do jack shit to help when it costs you the election. How do you intend to change things when your candidate never wins?

&amp;gt;The 'game' that you speak of is a disgusting joke. The future of our country and our world shouldn't be viewed as some sort of adversarial game, just like our justice system shouldn't be. Just because it is doesn't mean I need to accept that at face value.

Oh spare me the self-righteous indignation- I was speaking metaphorically. 

&amp;gt;Bernie's position on guns could very well stem from his belief about guns and whatever he has read/learned on guns over the years. I'm not convinced that guns should be fully restricted in our country and I suppose he isn't either.

Yes. A Brooklyn native who admitted in 1992 that he only won the Vermont House election with the help of the NRA just so *happens* to express pro-gun views in one of the most pro-gun state in the country. Then when he becomes a national candidate he comes out in favor of an assault weapons ban- something he voted *against* in 1994 and 2005. I'm *sure* it was a coincidence. 

&amp;gt;Say all the stuff about Obama you want, I've expressed the major issues I had with his administration, namely the complete lack of transparency, the 8 years of war, and his wonderful war on whistleblowers.
He also didn't stop the feds from trying to crack down on legal marijuana and medical was approved in California. I specifically remember dispensaries being raided and it being a point of contention.

No, he wasn't the progressive paragon that we all hoped. The Anointed One disappointed you. Why do you expect Bernie would be any different? 

&amp;gt;That's a cute quote you got there. I don't believe in voting for the lessor of two evils. Evil is evil. It's like would you rather I stab you to death, or shoot you in the head?

You're in for about 60 years of disappointment, then. You're never, and I mean *never*, gonna see a perfect candidate win. Best accept that now.

I'm 26 lol.  That still puts me at 10 when bush was elected.

I suppose this is a value judgement on whether or not you trust/believe Assange, but he says that he has material worthy of indictment and I'm inclined to believe him.  She also tried deleting them all indicating that she felt she had something to hide.  Even if there isn't something seriously fucked up in there, the entire premise of the server to to bypass the transparency granted through FOIA requests which is incredibly unethical at the very least.

I use the Iraq war as one point in a series of being pro military intervention.   That is my issue with the Iraq war, Military action in Syria, etc.  You can say whether Iraq was good or bad decision on her part and you can downplay the importance of that vote but she explicitly was in support of Syria.

You can view it as rigid or trustworthy, the point is you know where they stand, and the only time that is an issue is when it's an objectively bad position to be rigid/trustworthy on.  Our country is shit because we let unprincipled people get in and maintain power.  You want to concede that you have to be unprincipled then you can do that and vote for whoever you want, I won't.

You can say you were speaking metaphorically about the 'game' of politics but plenty of people view the legal and political profession as an adversarial 'game' because they want to win.  The goal should be to do public good, not to claim a personal victory at any cost.  Once again, you can disagree and say you need to work within the system, but a fucked system has no inclination to let you kill it.  So working within it by voting for candidates put forth by it is not going to change anything.

I don't care about Bernie Sanders as an individual.  This is about the merits of Clinton.  But to answer your question, Did he support the NRA because they backed him, or did the NRA back him because of his position on guns?  I don't follow the guys whole career but maybe the mass shootings changed his mind.  Maybe he did it just for political theater, but based off his image I doubt he changed his position just because it was politically expedient.  That has to do with his image which supports that, while Clinton's does not.  

You said all the great things Obama did, I told you what he failed to do.  I weigh the areas he failed higher than I weigh the areas he succeeded in.  That's a personal value judgement.  You an feel free to weigh and value things differently than I do.  We will just disagree on how we view the merits of Obama's 8 years.  I don't think Obama stood on principle and I think the difference on the issues I mentioned is whether you care more about being elected, or more about doing the right thing.  I could be wrong about Sanders, but his 30 years of politics show a consistent trend apart from as you mention, him on guns.

I don't need to see a perfect candidate win.  I need to see someone who is not at least 50% shit win.  I would of been content with sanders as being 80% decent.  There is plenty about Sanders positions that disappoints me but I view him as more good than bad.

You can say I will never see a perfect candidate and that's true.  But someone like Sanders would of been close enough and we almost saw that.  If the democrats treated him fairly we wouldn't even be having this conversation since many polls show that Sanders beats trump by like 15%, while Clinton is statistically tied with that dipshit.

    <text>You can't do the right thing is you're don't get elected. Gene McCarthy stood on principle. So did George McGovern. So did Dennis Kucinich, Ralph Nader. Tell me, how much did they change the system? In practical terms, how did their sticking to their guns change government policy? 

I can tell you're young because you seem think legal weed and whistleblower protection are more important than unemployment, economic security, healthcare, gay rights, transgender rights, awareness of racial disparities, the possibility of prison and sentencing reform some time in the near future, etc. Believe me- once you have actual responsibilities and a real job, healthcare, unemployment, the economy, etc, will all matter a lot more than whether you can smoke a joint legally or whether Julian Assange can verbally pleasure himself with the sound of his own voice in public. 

Nothing I can say will convince you that Bernie Sanders isn't the Messsiah. I get it. All of his flip flops were based in deep-seated principle, while all of Hillary's are because she's a corporate shill. 

That being said, I have to ask you: ***what if you're wrong?***

What if Trump *does* get elected. What if the House stays in GOP hands in 2018 because of gerrymandering, and what if the Senate stays in GOP hands because the Democrats overperformed in 2012? ***What if Trump gets reelected?*** You seem so sure that he'd be a one-term president, when you're talking about the electorate that gave George Bush two terms. Are you willing to risk that kind of damage? Are you, *really?*

If Donald Trump wins he'll appoint Antonin Scalia's successor. Clarence Thomas is talking about retiring, so is Anthony Kennedy, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg is basically a walking corpse at this point. Do you really feel safe giving Donald Trump **four** supreme court vacancies to fill? Knowing that he's promised to appoint the most conservative justices he can?  </text>

As I said, Sanders came close which shows you that there is hope.  You could argue that Nader changed things by existing since if it wasn't for him we wouldn't have had bush :P

You aren't talking about the same electorate that gave us bush.  That was 12 years ago.  Many old people have died since then and you have a more active youth vote.  He could get reelected.

The SCOTUS nominations are an issue and the prospect of 3-4 new   conservative justices would be pretty terrible.

I'm sure I can be wrong and I like to think I'm open to being wrong.  But they are both terrible candidates hence why they have the highest unfavorabilites among any two candidates in history.  

What do you want from this conversation anyway?  You want me to say I'm going to vote for Clinton in Florida?</text>

    <text>You think Clinton is a war criminal? Are you blind? All past presidents are war criminals. The US is an imperialist state that has the most powerful criminal army. The amount of crimes the armed forces committed is countless. And you single Clinton out? Most past presidents have done far worse than what Clinton has done. You need to open your eyes and realize that Clinton is not unique in this regard and definitely not the worst, and then you need to accept the fact that your country has done some of the most despicable things on this planet.</text>

    <text>It's not. Complaining about "flip-flopping" whenever a candidate changes their position on an issue years later always bugs me. Literally any time somebody writes to their senator, calls for change, etc., they want their representative to "flip-flop" on an issue, and it's good that they do. But suddenly, when it's an election year, candidates get shit for doing this.

The one issue I think Hillary legitimate changed just for the sake of it was on the TPP. I would have much preferred her to have stuck with a pro free-trade stance.</text>

    <text>There's philosophy and then there is practice.

When one writes to their representative, they are arguing why the same philosophy should be practiced in X way.  Usually, they aren't writing to try to change a mind, but to advocate a position without knowledge of their representative's position.

But now Hillary comes along and has held pretty much every position on every issue when it was expedient.  She has voted in favor of war and been a hawkish sec state.  There is literally no way anyone could agree with every position she has had so a lot of post-hoc reasoning is happening.

1. I don't see how this doesn't relate to Hillary. Aside from free trade, none of the bills she's changed her stance on were a shift in philosophy, just a realization that things like the crime bills and welfare reforms of the 90s had more negative effects on the people they were trying to help

2. I also don't think this is true. I think the *most effective* attempts to sway one's representative will follow this format, but you can be sure that every pro-gun-control dem in a red district is writing their representative in a way that doesn't fit that format at all

The debt level bill is something that the opposing party used to take as a formality kind of thing, it was never a serious issue until the Republicans try to shut down the government over it.

Honestly, there is a lot of things you could argue she has flip-flopped over in the past years.

No, I don't think claiming the the source is biased is at all a valid argument whatsoever. If someone tells you "The sky appears blue because of the way light is refracted by Earth's atmosphere.", it remains true, regardless of any personal bias. And if you don't trust the source (and you're fully right not to), question or seek out *their* sources.

    <text>I don't necessarily trust most people to pick up on nuance, but I feel like I'm pretty good at it. When someone laughs about defending a rapist of a 12 year old girl and laughs after "we came, we saw, he died" referring to their direct actions to murder someone, ignoring all the deeper factors, that person has a very clear sociopathic appearance about things.

When that person decides to "change their opinion" about moral issues, I believe there's no other possibility than it being a very direct method of exploiting people's likelihood to believe what they hear. It's actually frightening how many excuses people will make for someone that's painted in the right light by media. </text>

    <text>If you were a little more privy to nuance you'd know she was [not laughing about the outcome of the child rapist case](http://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-freed-child-rapist-laughed-about-it/), but rather about how the case had destroyed her faith in polygraphs, being that the defendant had taken one and passed despite being guilty. And "we came, we saw, he died", really? That's the bar for sociopathy? Is everyone who ever joked about the death of a horrible dictator a sociopath too? Moreover, Gaddafi was killed by Libyan rebels. Believe it or not, she is not directly responsible for literally every bad world event that happened while she was SoS (the ouster being the thing in question).

    <text>She "reluctantly" took on the case wherein a rapist male decided it would look best to have a female defendant?

Comparatively, with someone like Sanders in mind, her morals are obscure and entirely open to corporate interests. She worked for Walmart as they gouged their way into more corporate profit. She helped to destabilize the Middle East in different ways because it was a "business opportunity." 

I don't think she has a foot to stand on right now. She's a completely sociopath in her actions. And "the most negative coverage." From where? Fox? The places made to demonize/advertise for oligarchy opponents they prefer over someone genuinely *for the people?*

I'm sorry, but I can't follow your logic. If someone doesn't want to defend child rapists, they wouldn't work to defend child rapists. If someone doesn't want to support corrupt corporations, they wouldn't work for them. 

I'll be voting Trump in Indiana. As will my parents in their disgust at the thought of Hillary winning over Sanders.</text>

    <text>She was recommended to the case by the prosecutor and appointed by the judge. As a member of a legal clinic that helped low-income clients (in part to help alleviate the overburdened public defense system), she was available. She attempted to get out of the request but the judge held firm. Right to representation is a basic bedrock of our legal system, and refusing the judge's appointment would only result in the damaging of her legal career and the shifting of the case back to the public defenders. If every non public defender took such a position on every nasty case, we'd end up with even more crushing case loads for the public defense system.

As for Walmart: In the 80s, the company was under fire for not having a single woman on the board, so they caved to pressure and got Hillary, then First Lady of Arkansas, to do it. She wasn't their first choice and was actually a major outsider, but despite being a sort of symbolic presence she lobbied the board relentlessly about two pet issues: gender equality and environmentalism. She wanted them to hire and promote more women executives, which they mostly failed to do. But she had more success getting Wal-Mart to use cleaner energy and natural light in its stores.

She was mostly silent about Wal-Mart's notorious labor practices. That's regrettable, but the consensus from those on the board at the time was that if she'd been vocal about labor issues it would have further marginalized her position, and probably would have made it harder to advocate for women and the environment.

Mixed record? Sure, but it's also disingenuous to pretend that Wal-Mart and Hillary Clinton are mutually invested in each other. Even when she was on the board, it was hardly the source of her prestige or income— she was paid about $15,000 a year for an extremely part-time commitment, much less than she made at her actual job. And I don't think the rest of the Wal-Mart board felt any particular loyalty towards her. In 2005 she refused a $5,000 campaign contribution from Wal-Mart, citing her disagreements with the company. She has received much more substantial donations from various trade unions. As for the Middle East, both the suggestion that she purposely worked to destabilize the region and ascribing "business opportunity" as the definitive motive for such actions are rampant speculation at best (and that's if you're being super charitable with the definition of "speculation").

The methodology of the study on coverage tone is discussed in the article I linked, but since you couldn't be bothered to read it, the analysis encompasses more than 170,000 posts from WaPo, Fox, HuffPo, Politico, and CNN, among others. You can call it free advertisement and believe whatever nonsense about media blackouts, but to suggest they have some sort of love affair with her just because she's more well known than Sanders is nonsense and contrary to the evidence. 

Vote for whomever you want, as is your right. However, you might want to stop pretending you care about nuance when you read causality, motives, and psychological evaluations into people and situations you are clearly have only a passing familiarity with. Especially since you intend to vote for the antithesis of nuance because the people's candidate couldn't get the most people to vote for him.</text>

    <text>Some of those points are fair--on free trade, I see Clinton giving in to the populist/protectionist wave that's going on in the West at the moment (although it's stupid that they separated each trade agreement when it's more or less the same concept.) But most of the rest are stupid:
She voted against raising the debt limit in 2006 because she wanted to decrease the budget because it was military spending, while in 2015 it was for more liberal causes, just like tons of GOP legislators voted for the increase in '06 but not in '15. 

The two Syria points are one in the same--we learned more about Assad, and learned he was shitty. You can't be up in arms that we learned more about a world leader's atrocities and turned our backs on him. 

She opposed lifting the embargo almost two decades ago when the Cold War was less than a decade over and Cuba was committing way more human rights abuses than today. Almost no politicians wanted to lift the embargo in 2000.

The statement about the Iran deal is an unfair representation--she didn't want enrichment without supervision, which we (at least in theory) have now.

I honestly don't know about the Keystone pipeline or ethanol (except that Keystone was viewed more favorably early on when there weren't specifics) but I'd buy that the ethanol is an actual flip flop.

In '03 Mexican immigration to the US was HUGE, now the net flow is from the US to Mexico, so it's logical to be more supportive of illegal immigrants. She has become more liberal on these types of issues, like immigration and gun control though, gradually since the 90s. It's unfair to call that a flip flop if someone just moves in a certain ideological direction through their career.

People already covered the gay marriage issue/DOMA pretty well--she was generally supportive of the LGBT community, but this is an issue where she genuinely recognized she was on the wrong side of it and changed her view. (I assume you consider flip flops to be for political gain/generally disingenuous, not a genuine realization after considering facts/implications of your views)

Criticizing charter schools != being unsupportive of them all together.

There are a ton of more viable options for energy, clean coal is somewhat unnecessary, although I think it's fair to say that Clinton is more supportive of Clean Coal than other types of coal, or at least not as opposed to it.

    <text>I don't think that deserved the delta.  The reason she changes her mind is the issue.   She does whatever is politically expedient.  If I believed she changed her mind due to facts then I'd say is fine.   But she seems to change her mind based on what is popular or based on who paid her.

If you look at gay marriage it's ridiculous that she waited until 2012 to 'CHANGE' her mind.  I think she didn't care and just went with whatever the majority was favoring.

She can say she is against the Iraq war but those new leaked documents show she was the one who wanted us to get into Syria.  It seems lime she just changed her mind on Iraq because it's popular to be against it.  She is just as warlike as bush and Obama.

For the trade deals she publicly is against them now but supported them behind the scenes and probably still does.

The issue with her flip flopping is the cause of it.   Changing your mind is fine as long as it is consistent with facts and believable.   She is never consistent and certainly never believable. I don't know what trump will do, but I know Hilary will do what's in the best interest of donors and establishment which is not good for me. </text>

    <text>I also look at it as 4 years of trump vs 8 years of clinton.  Why would he only do whats in his individual immediate interest?  He's already rich, maybe he just wants to do what he think is right/best at this point in his life.  Who knows.  He's said so many things that you don't know exactly what he wants to do.  That's the issue with the republican primary though, you say crazy shit to win that and now its awkward moving back.  The thing is if Cruz won you would know his crazy is authentic but with trump you can't be sure of if he's legitimately crazy or not.

I'm not advocating that he would be great, but 4 years vs 8 years is how I look at it.  The republicans can't possibly put up a good candidate in 4 years.  

I can also understand not agreeing with my position because it does depend on how bad you view trump.  I view him as a semi crazy unknown while hillary seems like a lying warmongering schill/criminal who isn't transparent in the slightest.  She made a server to skirt FOIA requests for fucks sake.</text>

By voting for Trump you may get a drastic change in a horrible direction, or he may only be acting crazy but is actually sane. But is this really something you should gamble? I get people distrusting Hillary, but somehow not being alarmed by Trumps incostistency is baffling. What if trump sets us back 4 years with regressive policies? At least Hillary will not undermine the Democrats progressive agenda, and she says she'll have reforms. 

By not voting for Hillary you are indirectly increasing that trump will win. A vote for a third party will change nothing and reform is what we all want right?

I will concede that you are right about trump likely being terrible and regressive.  I've never denied that, but she hasn't done anything to earn my vote apart from not be trump, and I'm sorry but that's just not enough for me.

I'm also not confident that progressive change will happen fast enough.  This dying horse is going to hold on to its last breath.  Politicians like being able to get money from big donors and they aren't going to turn on that just because their constituency wants it.  Both sides end up taking big money and therefore you are forced to vote for 2 people who won't do anything about an important issue.

As an aside, I'm happy we were able to have a more or less civil discussion about this even if we don't agree on many levels.

    <text>&amp;gt;I don't think she will do anything to money in politics or reforming wall street because she has taken a stupid amount of money from them.

Obama took a pretty hefty amount of money from Wall St. 

While he definitely made a mistake in prioritizing system stability and credit confidence over minimizing moral hazard, he also did oversee the creation of the first Federal agency specifically tasked with protecting the American people from financial exploitation.

Based on how vehemently the financial industry lobbied to strangle Dodd-Frank in the crib, how they (successfully) made an attempt to prevent Elizabeth Warren from chairing the agency she designed, and now whisper their apprehension of Sen. Warren joining Clinton on the 2016 ticket, I think the chain of events that unfolded in Obama's two terms speak to how Clinton might proceed, with the exception that she has seen how Eric Holder was fricasseed for insufficiently prosecuting the moral fronts of Wall St. regulation.

It's abundantly clear now to Democrats with ambitions of higher office that the valence of base politics has changed significantly from the 1990s, or even the first decade of the 21st century. The issues that now motivate the most vibrant segments of America's party of the Left are now markedly closer to their grandparents' views, minus the ingrained neuralgia of the Cold War era. 

The triangulation policies that arose in the early 90s in the shadow of Reagan are impossible now, simply for the fact that the GOP has moved far enough to the right that pursuit of the marginal GOP voter for a Democrat is expensive enough in terms of ideological distance to warrant that voter be ignored altogether in favor of doing things to activate your base - irrelevant of how unappealing it makes you to the opposition. 

Put another way, progressives who are worried that HRC is a bloodless cipher of the prevailing political winds should rejoice, because the Obama years have provided a framework for an enduring demographic coalition that could assume the dominant role it enjoyed a century ago. Even if the House of Representatives remains in GOP hands, the Senate could quickly approve a large number (hundreds in totality) of HRC's nominees for positions in the executive branch, like regulatory heads (i.e. the BATFE, EPA, BLM, DoJ). Similarly, the Judiciary's large number of vacancies could be filled by a President Clinton with collaboration from a Democratic majority in the Senate.

The upshot is that you need to take as your first premise that nothing good in American politics can be gained without diffuse, diverse effort in unison toward a common goal. Second, that there are only two options on the table to choose from. Third, those choices will ultimately determine who sits in many more seats than the one in the Oval Office. </text>

That's it.  That's the only reason I might vote for him, and as I said elsewhere it's unlikely that I would vote for him anyway, I'd prefer to vote for Johnson or Stein so that if they hit their 5% thresholds in a national poll they can get matching by federal funding.

    <text>If you look at gay marriage almost every single politician was against it until at earliest the late 2000's. I'm a gay person. Gay rights are very, very important to me. But I see figures like Hillary Clinton who have given speeches in defense of gay rights across the world, who have walked in pride parades, who champion those rights today, as having understood that they were wrong and are willing to work toward the betterment of queer people.

The bankruptcy bill quoted above is wrong, too. She supported the bill only while heavily amended. When those amendments were later stripped by the Republican-controlled legislature, she joined her colleagues in filibustering the fuck out of it.

The Iraq war of course is a problem, but our 'hands off' approach in Syria has resulted in a massive destabilization of the region, an ongoing civil war with a huge amount of civil rights violations, and a refugee crisis that is in part a cause of the recent Brexit vote. Syria and Iraq were very different situations.

For trade deals, how on earth do you know what she 'probably still does' behind the scenes? That's not a real point.

Hillary has changed, yes, because she's adjusted her viewpoint between the first time she was in a position of political power 35 years and today Surprise surprise, the world is a very different place than it was 35 years ago. New facts and ideas have come to light since 1990, and she has adjusted her political views accordingly. There is nothing wrong with that. In fact, I'm highly suspect of anyone who can go that long without understanding that things are far more complicated and different than they thought.</text>

    <text>Congrats on being gay.  Some things should be seen by any sensible person as objectively right or wrong.  Gay marriage is one of them.  She can give all the speeches she wants but she only came out directly in support of it in 2012.  

Elizabeth warren apparently didn't feel like the bill was significantly better when she gave that interview trashing hillary clinton for supporting it getting into the senate.

Syria and Iraq are both part of same problem of us getting involved in too much shit.  It sounds callous, but honestly it's not problem.  We need to stop getting involved in shit at some point and it's just a matter of deciding when that point is.  You could argue it is our fault that Syria got to how it was and I'd say you are correct, but you have to choose some point to stop getting involved in other countries issues and if not now, then when?  The when doesn't feel like it exists for people like her.  

She's bought by corporations.  Trade deals that she supports are not going to be in consumer interest.  You can disagree if you want but you can google her shenanigans on trade deals.

I'm not opposed to people changing views.  I'm opposed to them changing them seemingly just to get support and not seeming to authentically believe things that are right.  She has an issue where shes the most untrustworthy politican you can imagine.  The fact that the server exists at all is ridiculous.  It's sole purpose is to dodge FOIA requests.

I think its good to authentically change positions on an issue when its in the American interest, but I don't believe she authentically changes her position.  It would also be fair to say that is a very difficult criteria for her to accomplish at this point in her career/life but that's solely because of her track record.

It's going to sound callous, but I don't think its our problem that dicatators are gassing their citizens and terrorists are on the other side.   There is always going to be a 'bad' guy for the US war machine to target.  You can guy back 30 years of presidents and I think you can find some conflict the US was involved in that we shouldn't have been.  Constantly saying we can stop getting involved later results in us never actually stopping.

She's taken 700k from Goldman Sach's and more money from many other people.  She won't release speeches from those events.  I don't believe someone hands you 700k just because they like you.

    <text>Nowhere in there does Sanders explicitly state support for same-sex marriage. It's always been much easier politically to support "equal rights for gays" than legalization of same-sex marriage...the one does not automatically imply the other. For example, during the Prop 8 debate in California, one of the arguments made by prop 8 proponents was that nothing about the law would violate equal rights for gays and lesbians because they have the same right as straight people do to marry someone of the opposite sex. Another argument was that allowing same-sex civil unions counted as equal rights for gays and lesbians because they allow for the same rights under the [state] laws, but it would just be called a different name.



http://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/

"While Sanders generally opposed measures to ban gay marriage, he did not speak out in favor of it until 2009."

"[In 1999] Many prominent Democrats, including Sanders’ successor as mayor of Burlington and a gubernatorial nominee, spoke out in favor of gay marriage, but Sanders kept mum."

"[In 2006] when Sanders was asked by a reporter whether Vermont should legalize same-sex marriage, he said no. “Not right now, not after what we went through,” he said."

"It wasn’t until 2009 that Sanders publicly voiced support for gay marriage, years after many of his contemporaries in Vermont."



http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_569fcc4de4b0a7026bf9e06f

"Sanders did support civil unions as far back as 15 years ago, but it was for the same reason he opposed the federal Defense of Marriage Act in 1996: his strong belief in state’s rights. He wasn’t advocating for legal marriage for same-sex couples. He actually avoided the subject.

As one Vermont columnist put it in 2000, getting a straight answer from Sanders on gay marriage “was like pulling teeth... from a rhinoceros.” In 2006, Sanders said he supported civil unions but not same-sex marriage, again deferring to states."</text>

    <text>Fair enough.  I will concede you are correct to a degree. He in fact, did not openly support gay marriage specifically until 2009 and only supported general equality which I think is still noteworthy.  I was reading both of their on the issues pages and it seems that his tone is a fair bit stronger in support of gay rights.  His only comment seemingly against gay marriage was the "Not right now" in relation to the 2006 possible federal amendment against same sex marriage.  To me it seemed like he just meant that it needs some time because emotions are running high, which he confirms in this interview.  

http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/10/27/sanders-defends-2006-opposition-to-same-sex-marriage/

But you are indeed right he hasn't seemed to say anything directly supporting gay marriage until 2009, which is still way before hilldog, and he also never said anything against gay marriage apart from that one quote, while hilldog directly said she didn't support gay marriage, just unions due to sacred something something nonsense.

The hilldog thing definitely seems like she was trying to fence sit a bit more on her position.  I don't necessarily believe she was ever against gay marriage, but that she voiced it is the problem.

As a caveat, most people who responded to me so far seem to think I'm some sort of die hard bernie support.  I'm not.  I'd support him but I don't think he's the second coming of jesus or anything.</text>

    <text>I think that the subtext of "appealing to the masses" when used as a negative is that the politician in question is just giving lip service to the issue. 

To use a Hillary example...is she a progressive, or a moderate? If she's in front of a more conservative big money crowd, then she says "I'm a moderate." When she's talking to a group of young activist voters, then she says "I'm a progressive." She'll say whatever needs to be said to "appeal to the masses."

Contrast this with Bernie Sanders, who never had to change his message to appeal to the masses; the masses happened to agree with his message, which by definition made it appealing to them. 

It all comes down to adjective vs verb. I like it when candidates are appealing(adjective) to me. I don't like it when candidates are appealing(verb) to me.</text>

    <text>which means these people who were in positions of power oppressed and ruined people's lives 20 years ago

if someone murders people for fun and sport then 20 years later "learns" that they shouldn't have done so does that mean they weren't wrong and culpable for their actions 20 years ago?

of course not</text>

    <text>While that is true, can we agree that it is helpful to contrast the amount of hindsight that a person must employ?

Although hindsight is important and it is admirable to change ones views when presented with new information, it's arguably more admirable to just make the right decision the first time around.</text>

    <text>It is okay to be wrong, but if you're wrong about seemingly common-sense issues like gay marriage (any human rights issue should be common sense for a democratic candidate), it raises questions about their judgement.

    <text>No politician ever admits to being wrong publicly, because the media never fails to accuse them of flip-flopping or being weak willed. I can't think of a single exam of a politician saying "I was wrong." If they do, it's usually phrased as "we were wrong." They'll find a way to shift the blame onto someone else - they'll say that not all of the facts were available, maybe. Or they'll just straight up deny they ever held a different opinion. Because that is what works for the media.</text>

Well that is just definitely not true. Being politically savvy means that you know what it takes to get where you want in politics, what strings to pull when. You won't be any kind of leader, competent or not, without knowing how to play your cards right to get to that position.

&amp;gt;"People" may not like it when politicians change, but I have no problem with politicians changing and have *every* problem with politicians openly lying about key issues

That would be a great mindset if we lived in a perfect world where EVERYONE cared as much about this/politics in general. But it's not a perfect world, and the general population responds better to their politicians being stone slabs with their political positions carved into them than actual people.
I'm not trying to make it sound honorable to lie about positions she took before and now have changed, just that instead of labeling her a liar right off the bat, realize that she probably knows she changed her position and, even if she wanted to, shouldn't admit to it.</text>

There was no additional information with regards to homosexuality and gay marriage.  That was clearly a politically expedient move.

    <text>&amp;gt; There was no additional information with regards to homosexuality and gay marriage.

Actually, this is inaccurate. The facts around lgbt issues and gay marriage were *not* clear early on. 

Although in hindsight everything is 20/20 and we know better, back in the 80s and 90s there was a great deal of misinformation and plenty of misunderstandings about the nature of being gay. It was unclear whether it was genetic and therefore normal or a mental illness, whether it had links to pedophilia, whether children of gay couples would turn out normal, etc. 

These all seem like stupid thoughts now, but reasonable, rational people were uncertain on these issues back then. 

So it's inaccurate to suggest that nothing changed.</text>
