    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

I mean....if you hold them to such a standard. I, a person who isn't related to the Americas in whichever sense, could also claim I am an American because it won't harm anyone in a meaningful way.</text>

    <text>Sure you could, it wouldn’t. The problem here is people taking issue with it.</text>
