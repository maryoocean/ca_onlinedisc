    <title>CMV: the economic and social conditions that created the so-called stability of the 1950s are unique, thus it's foolish to try to recreate that time period.</title>

    <original_post>The 1950s in popular imagination are a time of prosperity and stability. Whether this is or is not the case, a great many people, particularly on the right, particularly repeatedly-bankrupt millionaires who's eyes look like their mouths, seem to think of this time period as something to emulate. 
The fact of the matter is that this is patently absurd. The economy of the 1950s was so strong and America so dominant because every other country that could possibly compete with us was rebuilding from World War II. Short of Europe and East Asia destroying themselves in a nuclear holocaust or us halting all trade into this country, that is a condition that is nevergoing to happen again. 
The 1950s are also known for a level of social homogenity that is largely a product of low immigration. The 1965 Immigration Act repealed many of the limits on immigration put in place in the 1920s. 
The fact of the matter is that what the Baby Boomers consider to be America's decline is actually America returning to the conditions that had persisted for the 170 years preceding the 1950s. Present conditions- that is, an unstable economy, lots of immigrants, and a religious minority that many people are mistrustful of- is the normal state of affairs in this country. A more achievable goal is a return to the conditions (both economically and socially) of the 1990s- a decade which will undoubtedly in 20-30 years be as idealized by Millennials as the 1950s was by Baby Boomers

    <text>By 1950, non-communist countries were exceeding pre-war GDPs and per capita GDPs.  This was even true of Germany, which was bombed to hell, militarily occupied, systematically looted by the Russians, and then divided politically.   It's true that they weren't at American levels, but they weren't at American levels before the war and aren't at American levels now.
