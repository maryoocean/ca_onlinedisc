    <title>CMV: I do not believe in any absolute morality.</title>
    <original_poster>CARTARS22</original_poster>
    <original_post>Probably in reaction to my rebellion to my Christian upbringing, I have a hard time accepting any objective morality. I understand Christian morality, but as a non-christian I recognize my moral feels as a neurological response trained by evolution and society. I don't believe in any connection between myself and those I "care" about. I believe that I (humanity) act on what will have positive effects on my feelings, and that is the only reason I help others. How can there be a morality that stands above my self-preservation.

    <text>You may or may not choose to be moral. But morality, and our values of right and wrong are underneath it all based on objective facts. We think of pain as bad and lack of it or joy/pleasure as good. A simple example is we consider feeding the hungry to be good only because objectively/scientifically people need sustenance to survive and hunger is unpleasant/painful/undesirable. Underneath it all, morality is based on science. As our knowledge of science expands we formulate better (more objective, more reliable) ideas of right and wrong.</text>

You don't seriously believe this, do you?

    <text>I agree. I think he uses science when he should have used a better word such as an evolving knowledge or capacity for reason. Science is a broad term, which encompasses various assumptions about it depending on how it is used and in what context.</text>

    <text>Or maybe empathy.  It seems to me that morality is succinctly described in the golden rule.</text>

    <text>If the rightness or wrongness of an act can be determined scientifically, then maybe you can explain how murder is objectively wrong.</text>
