    <title>CMV: women are not going for the 'upper tier' of men</title>
    <original_poster>BadgerSame6600</original_poster>
    <original_post>I see this rhetoric over and over and over online, and hear it IRL sometimes.  It drives me crazy tbh. I am a man out in the world, living life, 35 years of it now. I have friends who are all over the spectrum of physical attractiveness. Some are single, most aren't. Their gfs/wifes are also across the spectrum. In most couples I know, friends and acquaintances,  the woman is better looking, earns more, or has more social skills ect. 

Now I know this is my experience, so it is anecdotal, but at the same time I just don't buy this whole women are too choosy. My opinion is that the dudes who say this are refusing to address their flaws and accept them. If these men believe this and they go out into the world feeling hard done by, fighting a losing battle, then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Most people can smell that level of victimhood a mile of. 

OK, open to have this challenge, so- change my view, Redditors! </original_post>

    <text>Your title and post don't really match. Yes, incels are largely unattractive due to their attitudes.

However, that's how a few men feel and think, not what women are going for. I would argue that women do want "upper tier", but the definition is relative and not only defined by financial well being, but of course anyone would like a higher income earner as a partner.

A scrub is a man who can't get no love from me, hanging from the passenger side of his best friends ride trying to holler at me.

It's a song that's been sung for decades.</text>
