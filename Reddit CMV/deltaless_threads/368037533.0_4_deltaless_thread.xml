    <title>CMV: In the future when the average age of death is significantly higher than today, the age of adulthood will also be significantly higher.</title>

    <original_post>This is just something that popped into my head and I thought about it for a few minutes. 

The reason I think that if the average age of death is higher that the age that a person is considered an adult will be higher is because that is how our society has functioned so far. Long ago children were considered adults at maybe 13 or so. Now it's 18. I think this is because the age of death being greater now then long ago. So I'm just extending this reasoning to the future. 

Really I made this post so that I can hear some better reasoning as to why this would happen or why it wouldn't. 

Cheers!
