    <title>CMV: Marriage is not hard work</title>
    <original_poster>Lorenzo_Brandy</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have been married for five years. We have one child together. We rarely argue and never fight. I don't feel like this is the result of the kind of concerted effort that certain people state is necessary for maintaining a marriage. Rather, we were very much in love from the outset and have therefore cultivated habits of being together easily. We also have put our marriage at the center of our lives (as opposed to, say, careers), which we were more than happy to do. We of course have had hard times, but neither of us have had rhe sense that these threatened the marriage in any way. It seems like a popular trope that marriage is hard, sometimes unpleasant endeavor and I get a little bent out of shape about it because it's not descriptive of my experience and I feel like it doesn't have to be that way.</original_post>

    <text>Marriages definitely take effort, and at times that effort will be difficult. By stating that it "is not hard work" you are implying that you should not put effort into it. I doubt that is what you mean. </text>
