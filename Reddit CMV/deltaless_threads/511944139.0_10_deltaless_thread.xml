    <title>CMV: People forgo their right to complain if they never do anything about it</title>
    <original_poster>ooselfie</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have a few friends that complain about their life ALL the time. I hear things like:

"My job sucks, I'm miserable here"

"God school sucks, I'm studying something so uninteresting"

I think they have total control - it comes down to laziness, or perhaps they don't even really want anything to happen. It is so easy to put in some extra effort in your day to make things happen for yourself. They complain and complain but never do anything to change. It's like the boy who cried wolf. 

If you constantly complain, but do nothing to mend the problem, then you shouldn't be allowed to complain.

I'll go with your examples. 
Say you hate your job, but it's the only job you're qualified for in your area. You *could* look for a new job but it would require moving. That would mean finding a new place to live, uprooting your family, and moving away from everyone you know. 
For school, say you realize what you're studying isn't interesting to you, but you only have one semester left. You *could* change your major but that will put an extra 3 years of time and money into graduating. 

Maybe your friends are just whiny. That's not all cases though. </text>
