    <title>cmv: There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as an “American”</title>

    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>Different languages have different rules and conventions. In English this is obviously the standard practice, but in some other languages (particularly Spanish) the rules and conventions are different. 

From your other comments it seems like the context was in a class where people were correcting how you refer to yourself when speaking in German. I don't speak German, but maybe the rules and conventions are different in that language? If so, when speaking that language you should follow those rules and conventions. 

Referring to yourself as "American" in an English-speaking context is fine and doesn't carry any negative or patronizing connotations. If, however, you insist on bringing your English-brain conventions and rules into another language, then you're actually being kind of a jerk (or setting yourself up for lots of meaningless conflicts). 

Different language, different rules.</text>
