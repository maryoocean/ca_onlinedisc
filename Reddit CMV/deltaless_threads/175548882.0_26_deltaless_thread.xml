    <title>CMV: Public transportation should run 24/7.</title>
    <original_poster>Keep-reefer-illegal</original_poster>
    <original_post>We live in a world that is no longer 9-5. Businesses stay open later, friends can reach us with a portable device simply by typing on a mini keyboard. It doesn't make sense that public transportation isn't 24/7. Here are some reasons why it should be 24/7:

1. Very few buses run at 2 am for last call, I feel like if nothing else, running buses later let's responsible drunk people take public transit instead of driving home. 

2. It would benefit the working poor who may work night shift 

3. As mentioned before our world is now 24/7 

Those are my arguments. 

I encourage you all to change my view 

Edit: by transit I am including trains, buses, all forms of public transportation, not just buses.

    <text>Surely, the biggest counter to this is that, of all places that have public transport, very few of them require 24 hour transportation.

The needs of different regions vary greatly. The centre of a large, metropolitan city has vastly different transport needs than an isolated town. Saying that all public transport should be 24 hours could make sense in some places, but is completely senseless in others.

For example, family of mine lives in the suburbs of a small city.  Most people in the areas have cars, but there is a public transport service that covers the general area, which turns out to be a large collection of residential areas. It's not very frequent even during the day, and is never packed. This service stops at about 8pm and frankly, there is very little demand for it afterwards. Yes, some people might want to use it after bars close, but I've been walking around the area several times after midnight and it is not uncommon to find absolutely no traffic whatsoever. Making a bus service run even once every couple of hours would lose money. There is already suitable taxi availability for those who miss the last bus. Furthermore, if I found myself needing public transport at such a late hour, I'd probably take a taxi even if it was available, because who wants to wait an hour for a bus when I can take a taxi right now?

I get that many areas, 24 hour service might be useful and not a waste, but I think you will find that in these places, 24 service is already in place or being introduced. If there is a large enough demand, then there is sense in implementing 24 public transport, but it does not make sense if there isn't enough demand or when that demand is satisfied by alternatives such as taxis.

I think you will find that it definitely makes a lot of sense to not run public transport when there is not enough demand for it, and that where there is demand, public transport will run. Mandating that all public transport be 24/7 is a waste of public funds and valuable road space.</text>
