    <title>I dont think manslaughter or any crime committed accidentally should be considered a crime. At all. CMV</title>

    <original_post>If it is proven that the offender had no intention of committing a crime, why should they be persecuted because the odds were against them? 


EDIT: Ok, many people have used the example of "what if a person is driving drunk and they kill someone?" I still think they should only be punished for driving drunk.</original_post>

    <text>Most 'accidental' crimes usually have very high thresholds o fnegligence. Ie you weren't trying to kill them, but you were doing something incredibly dangerous that you knew had a risk of serious harm/death.

So we discourage people from doing these things.</text>

    <text>We discourage them also because one's negligence put someone else's life in danger. You can be as cautious as possible on the road, if a mad driver rushes into you there's no escape. </text>

    <text>And you wouldn't be charged with manslaughter. You need criminal liability for there to be a manslaughter charge.

If someone is drunk driving and runs into your car and dies, you will not be charged with manslaughter as long as you were not acting irresponsibly.</text>
