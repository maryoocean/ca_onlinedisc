    <title>CMV: one day we will view people who eat meat as disgusting and immoral.</title>
    <original_poster>oaknugginz</original_poster>
    <original_post>Once, humans had very little regard for any living thing outside of their tribe. We were small nomadic groups who thought little of killing other humans simply to eliminate the risk that they might hypothetically pose to us.

Forming cities and later nation-states, our circle of empathy grew wider. Our tribe was able to grow larger thus our feelings of empathy grew to encompass anyone who was in the enlarged, new model of our old tribe. 

As we progressed and gained more knowledge and wisdom our morals changed with us. We gained empathy over time and our ideas about what was okay and what wasnt have changed rapidly. Not so long ago, it was considered okay to enslave, rape and otherwise brutalise another human, as long as they were outside of your tribes circle of empathy.

The basic things that made us understand that these other people were infact people were simple: they are capable of pain and suffering, and they dont deserve it any more than we do. They deserve freedom from persecution. A very recent example is gay and trans people, who we are currently bringing into the circle.

I believe that our circle of empathy will continue to grow and I believe that it is inevitable that animals will gain entrance to our circle of empathy. And that in many ways they already are. They are capable of suffering and they dont deserve it any more than slaves did 500 years ago.

If you ask people on the street whether or not an animal deserves to suffer, most will say no. But we still cause the suffering and premature deaths of tens of billions of animals every year in factory farms. 

I believe that in the near future, we will be viewed as savage beasts with no regard for what is right or wrong in account of this hypocrisy and implicit acceptance of evil acts.

**edit: im not talking about people who require meat to survive, im talking about you and me.**

    <text>During the industrial revolution the workers dealt with truly awful conditions. We had children working 16 hour days in mines or under machinery, getting paid fuck all money and dying at horrific rates. This also at the time when we decided to start completely fucking the environment.

Both things are seen as wrong now and we (in the west anyway) have progressed beyond child labour and instilled standard workers rights. The likes of which would be unrecognisable 200 years ago.

But we don’t look back at victorians with anywhere near the vitriolic hate you want to ascribe to meat eaters today. We don’t think of them as “savage beasts” and we know they did have a regard for what is right and wrong, just like we do today. We have just progressed and refined what that means.</text>

I would say thats mostly because its an obscure example.

We do look back with vitriolic hate at Nazi Germany and slave-owners etc.</text>

    <text>If obscurity is enough to save a whole time period from vilification, then it's a fairly big assumption on your part that anyone will know or care about factory farming In the future.

What you've really done is dismiss an example you haven't considered, in favour of 2 cherry picked ones. What about public torture and execution, treating women as belongings,  the treatment of physically or mentally disabled people, pretty much all of feudalism, most of imperialism etc. Etc. Throughout history every single generation has done things that we find distasteful. That's what progress does.


Your examples really are the exception and you aren't even representing them honesty. Why are you equating  the perpetrators of the holocaust and slave owners  (presumably from transatlantic trade)  to meat *eaters*? The equivalent would be people that own factory farms, not people that eat meat.

We don't tar the entirety of human civilisation, that was using slaves for thousands of years, with the brush of savages that had no concept of right and wrong. We don't do that for the entire population of Germany during WW2 either.</text>
