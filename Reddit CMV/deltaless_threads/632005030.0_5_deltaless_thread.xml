    <title>CMV: The Republican party could guarantee a victory in the next election if they would reach out to labor unions.</title>
    <original_poster>humbleprotector</original_poster>
    <original_post>While Ronald Reagan was a very anti-union president, the Democratic party championed for labor. But in recent history Bill Clinton drafted NAFTA. With the Democratic support of Outsourcing USA Jobs and now open borders they lost a tremendous amount of loyal supporters. The AFL-CIO is a massive lobby group with one of the largest voter support of any but they saw their support fractured in the last election because of policies pushed by the Democratic Party, and the effects of the democratic economy. Forcing an American worker to compete with illegal wages, and with third world wages is not Labour friendly and loyal Democratic voters are leaving because they haven't seen a return for all their loyal support. Change my view.....</original_post>

    <text>Other users have already outlined a bit the ways in which Republicans have not been labor-friendly recently, and how they'd need to shift policy significantly to be viewed as such.

But I'd also like to point out that most voters are not one-issue voters. Most of us take multiple things into account, and most of us don't agree with every single platform of the party we vote for; we just agree with most of them. One of the biggest issues with the US political system right now is that our parties are split not just on political issues (taxes, state vs. federal responsibilities, etc.) but on issues that many people consider to be moral ones. And for most people, morality trumps economics. To me, it doesn't really matter what Republicans will do for my wages or the economy as long as so many prominent figures in the party make comments that reveal--or even actively promote--sexism, racism, homophobia, and transphobia. They can try to tell me they're on my side because they're fighting to keep well-paid jobs in the US, but how can I think someone is truly on my side or represents me when they turn around and claim those same jobs are being stolen by immigrants, or that we need to keep brown people out of the country? That's not someone who wants to help me. That's someone who wants my vote so they can help my white peers. And until that changes, so many of us who the Republican party casts as the "other" and the enemy can't vote for them.</text>

no, they have been very labor friendly, just not labor union friendly, largely because labor unions are corporations that donate to the democrat party.

Unions are obsolete and are more often than not just corrupt money making organizations that don't even support their workers, much like the democrat party.</text>
