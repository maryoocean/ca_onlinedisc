    <title>CMV: The notion that the Democrats or Republicans "must" run Biden or Trump "because there are no other viable candidates" is ridiculous. There are thousands of people who would make better presidential candidates for 2024 than Biden or Trump.</title>
    <original_poster>SteadfastEnd</original_poster>
    <original_post>Every argument for Biden or Trump to run in 2024 boils down to some version of "status quo" or "inertia." We're told that the Ds and Rs have no choice but to run these super-old candidates because there's nobody else who could be suitable.

&amp;#x200B;

In a nation of 332,000,000 people, there are well over 100 million who are over the age of 35, American-born, and have resided in the United States for 14 years or more - in other words, are constitutionally eligible to run for president.

Out of those 100 million, surely at least half have a basic education, are mature, sensible, decent people, and have demonstrated solid character - and also be significantly younger than Trump or Biden.

Out of those 50 million, surely at least ten million would qualify as *highly* educated - the metrics of which can be tricky to figure out (is it a master's degree? or something else?) - but they would be significantly above average.

Out of those 10 million, surely at least one million would be quite exceptional - people who have substantially high IQ, have advanced quite far in life and a career - such as being a doctor, or having worked in public governmental service for decades, etc.

And out of those million, surely at least 10,000 would have the political know-how, the charisma, the political interest, maybe have spent significant time abroad in foreign countries or speak multiple languages, to be a suitable president.

In fact, even in Congress, state legislatures or governorships alone, there must be dozens of good, qualified, educated, experienced politicians who would be much younger than Trump or Biden, and who would make suitable presidential candidates. 

So, CMV on this one. I don't buy for one moment the notion that, in a nation of 332 million people, America somehow has no choice but to run Biden vs. Trump in 2024 because "we've got no one else who'd be a good candidate."  </original_post>

    <text>They‚Äôre running Trump and Biden cause they have an interest in keeping people entrenched in the status quo. ‚ÄúA better candidate‚Äù isn‚Äôt in their interest. Too much work, too much unpredictability.

They don‚Äôt care about you and I. The American two party system is class warfare, clear as day.</text>

    <text>So, the rich white guy who lowers taxes across the board while favoring high earners vs. the rich white guy who raises taxes but gives out a limited amount of student loan forgiveness is class warfare?

    <text>Yeah how‚Äôs income inequality in America? What‚Äôs the minimum wage at now, like $22/hr? We have better workers rights compared to other developed Western countries? It‚Äôs what, 1 year mandated paid leave when you have a kid? How‚Äôs our healthcare? Union membership? You mentioned taxes‚Ä¶ Those favor the working class? Wall Street and big banks, there haven‚Äôt been a bunch of stock buybacks or anything as of late right? SEC doing its job? We leading the world in environmental protection and investment in renewables? How much oil we been pumping? Just a little, right? You seen any corporate monopolies as of late? Folks in Congress, they tend to be of average wealth right? Any weird insider trading going on over on The Hill?

Pretending America has a functioning progressive party who supports working class folks is insane. We have one center party and one far right party. We have no progressive politicians in America, save Bernie.

Enjoy your table scraps though. Good thing we were forgiven all those student loans that the rest of the world DOESNT have.</text>

    <text>No doubt the current situation is bleak, however, one party is actively trying to kill me and my family off and have me die in the street and the other is barely keeping us alive, so there's that.  I don't know if I will even physically survive another GOP reign. When Trump was holding the ACA subsidies hostage, my insurer said CSR wasn't paid on time and told me " the system automatically dropped" me in and I would have to reapply and wait to be approved all over again so I wasn't able to receive my Trelegy that I require to continue breathing at all and that set off the hellish period where I had to be resuscitated 6 times in 2 month period. I am honestly terrified of GOP seizing control again for good reason.  


People honestly do not understand the real stakes and impact this has on who gets to live or die here, while one side is actively killing us while they give billionaires tax breaks.   


The only way this stand off ever changes is people stop electing GOP forever tbh. Like they have to never get elected again if we have any hope to pry the country out of the far rights grip.  Which yes, that is delusional because of all the tinfoil hats  that are now mainstream these days. People don't understand that the progressives are only a small minority within the democrats and the rest of the dems are center and right. They can't shift the party left  at all when the right still has too much control of the country as a whole.   


It's honestly insane that anyone in the US is convinced that democrats are  these left wing extremists, when the majority of them aren't even left.  Dems can't split between left center and right until the general populace finally sees the GOP for the nutjobs they are. The disinformation in the US is rampant  to the point that many people here are in need of a cultlike deprogramming to even begin to recover from everything that is broken at this point. The evangelical extremists  have taken over the school boards and have trying to force creationism to be taught in Biology here. Biology is only Biology in name only and have pastors teaching it instead of qualified teachers. They ban Stephen Hawking's books and send the kids to school with bulletproof backpacks. Ban Theatre and want to arm the teachers, and we have people  here who legitimately see this as  reasonable course of action. üíÄ</text>
