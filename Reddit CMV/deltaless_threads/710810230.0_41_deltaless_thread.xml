    <title>CMV: High school literature and history courses fail to provide meaningful educational value</title>
    <original_poster>dabears_24</original_poster>
    <original_post>In their current form, high school courses focused on history and literature fail to provide meaningful educational benefits. 

These classes commonly have a goal of improving critical thinking skills and develop advanced literacy. However, the format of current history courses where students heavily analyze past events, does not emphasize critical thinking, but rather focuses on memorization of history that has little to no significance in the present. Literature classes that focus on deep analysis of *important* texts like Shakespeare's works, complex poetry, or stylistic writing (i.e. stream-of-consciousness in "Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man") do not develop readinc/writing skills applicable to students' lives or modern texts. They also tend to foster dislike for reading when students are forced to extract meaning from texts they do not value or understand.

I believe a courses in debate, critical analysis of nonfiction works (i.e. argumentative opinion pieces), or even literary analysis of more familiar works would all be better alternatives to detailed US history or general literature courses.

Since this is a broad statement with caveats, I'll clarify in a list:

- I am not arguing the classes offer zero value. The concept of being in an educational environment likely has benefits itself, so my view will not be changed by arguments of the form "all education has value".


- I acknowledge the value of basic history lessons in understand society, culture, and history that affects us today. I am arguing that there is little to no value in all students having to learn of details like specific battles of the Civil War, or the politics of the early 1800s. These topics should be pursed electively.


- I am not arguing that these classes lack value only because they do not tie to future careers. I believe these two courses majorly fail to provide value. I agree that math and science courses do not necessarily tie into future work, but I believe they accomplish their goals more effectively.

I admit I may display a STEM-favoring bias due to my field of study and work, so I am willing to accept arguments that show that my view is a function solely of my bias and not of reason.

EDIT: Want to clarify that I still think history should be taught at a general level in school. I don't think it should be as detailed or exhaustive as a part of the core curriculum. In other words, I think the necessary history can be taught in fewer total classes

EDIT 2: Pretty late in the cycle now, but I'll add this regardless since I've engaged with a lot of arguments that misinterpret my post. I am not arguing against the value of History and Literature. I am saying these classes are ineffective in their current forms</original_post>

    <text>You’re making some broad assumptions here, namely that every high school has equivalent classes, that is not accurate. For example the history of the civil war is taught differently in the north versus the south. Same goes for literature, different districts have different standards. So making an judgement against all high school courses is absurd and speaks to an ignorance of how the system actually works. It’s definitely not apples to apples.</text>

    <text>I fully acknowledge the difference by state and region. I understand how the system works.

You're right that I can't judge against *all* high school history courses, but I'm fairly sure that the majority of them follow the same format. Even when we get to higher level AP classes (same curriculum for all schools), the focus is on an unnecessary level of historical detail, irrelevant of where it is being taught. The North and South may introduce their own biases, but the format remains highly similar</text>

    <text>Again it just sounds like you’re assuming all this, do you have data to back this up?  I don’t buy your argument about the level of historical detail, indeed the point of history class is to present the minutia and grey area so students can contextualize it. To make it all broad strokes, dumb the facts down to the lowest common denominator would miss the point entirely.</text>

    <text>I have taken 3 AP History classes and I have not found “irrelevant historical detail” and have generally seen an abundance of critical thinking in terms of essays, class debates, etc.</text>
