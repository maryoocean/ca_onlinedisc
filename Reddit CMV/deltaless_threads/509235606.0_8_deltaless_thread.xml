    <title>CMV: for the most part, fake news and russian trolls should be tolerated, because the fighting them causes more harm than good.</title>
    <original_poster>shijfmxew</original_poster>
    <original_post>there are a lot of posts lately about fake news and russian trolls. I know this has a lot of impact on public opinion and causes many people to misunderstand the world, and even gets ping pong shops shot up by idiots.

That said, it is my view that any effort to combat fake news by edit it, or by censoring it, it worse than having it just exist. it is my contention that if we start picking what is "Fake" and what is real, we will get to a slippery slope that will inevitably restrict our discourse more than would happen if we just allowed idiots to say their piece (even if they dont have good intent)

*i do think the best way to fight fake news is with more real news, but that's not what this argument is.

    <text>I think there are _lots of ways_ we should fight Russian trolls (or equivalents):

1. limit their ability to do their badness, within the context of continued assurance of our liberties as Americans.

2. education of our citizens about how to vet, read, evaluate and interpret information / media.

3. deeper commitment through our consumer power to _real_ journalism - work done with commitment to quality, investigation and truthfulness.

I could go on and on.  I don't see _any_ of these methods of fighting as doing harm - I see only upside.  You position universal editorial review and censorship (presumably by a centralized, powerful entity like government) as the only method of "fighting" and that seems shortsighted to me!</text>
