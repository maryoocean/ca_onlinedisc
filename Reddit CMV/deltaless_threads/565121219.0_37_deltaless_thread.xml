    <title>CMV: it is a jerk move to play music while camping within earshot of other campers.</title>
    <original_poster>estheredna</original_poster>
    <original_post>We put a tent up in a state park campground for about 4 weeks out of the summer. Most of the time you can just hear nature, people talking, kids playing, lots of birds and squirrels  . Every 5th day or so, there is someone who brings some Bluetooth speakers so they can listen to music , but loud  enough  that people in a half dozen sites nearby get to ‘enjoy’ whatever they are playing. 

Right now I’m cooking dinner and the guys next to me are playing U2, Dave Matthew Band and similar inoffensive crap.

This would be entirely normal in a backyard gathering, but once you reserve to be in a public campground, it becomes selfish, intrusive,  rude.

Am I wrong?

(I know it’s a known risk of car camping. I’m not really  mad. More rolling my eyes. I wish they’d shut that crap off.  )

    <text>You are not wrong. There are rules on some popular floating rivers against having music playing for the same reason. Nobody should be forced to listen to your music. People go there to relax and get away from the noise and enjoy nature. Can't do that with some group hooting and hollering and playing their bullshit music. Usually the younger crowds just have to be noticed for whatever reason.</text>

    <text>this will probably get removed but I needed to share this with someone else. Idk why the new camping movement is so inconsiderate. been doing the same sites and trails for years, and now those sites are full of louder music, and sites left with trash/food on the ground and I see litter on the trails</text>
