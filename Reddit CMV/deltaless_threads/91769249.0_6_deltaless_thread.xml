    <title>People should not break up fights unless one of the fighters explicitly states that they don't want to be fighting. CMV</title>

    <original_post>This has always been a major peeve of mine. I like watching random people fight, and I've been in a few myself. Every time there's a fight, some asshole decides to be a hero and try to break it up. Back in high school, these two kids pulled us apart even though we both explicitly stated that we wanted to fight. Now, I understand why a teacher, cop, or bouncer would do it, nothing against them, but if you're not an authority figure or at risk of injury or property damage yourself, you should let the people fight. For example, if you form a fight ring in high school around the two combatants, then no one is getting hurt, and nor is anyone not involved in the fight getting injured. In that case, no one should intervene unless an authority figure arrives. 

Now of course, there are exceptions. For example, if one person clearly does not want to be in the fight, then someone should break it up. For example, they may be asking for help or just being pummeled without throwing any punches themselves. Or if you witnessed the fight from the very beginning and one guy clearly just attacked the other without provocation. Then you should break up the fight. 

Otherwise, two adults should be allowed to fight and no one should intervene until one of them either states that he does not want to fight anymore, or is put into a state into which he cannot express this desire. Otherwise, people should just enjoy the show and mind their own fucking business.

So basically, if someone attacks another person without anyone around and the person fights back solely to defend themselves, nobody should ever intervene until one of them is unconscious? Am I interpretting that correctly?</text>

If they ask for help or otherwise verbally indicate that they no longer wish to participate in the fight, then bystanders should help.

That's directly from the OP. </text>
