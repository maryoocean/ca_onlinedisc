    <title>CMV: I believe that abortion as a result of consensual sex (without contraception) is wrong.</title>
    <original_poster>BreakinMyBallz</original_poster>
    <original_post>I feel as though women who choose to have sex without the means of contraception, simply don't care if they get pregnant. They put their pleasures over the risk of having a child and having it terminated. 

I feel as though, when the sperm and egg mix, they create a completely new set of DNA, DNA that has never been the same in the entire history of our species and is a completely unique person (I'm not Theist, I try to base my arguments on the uniqueness of each person)

I don't see any way for someone to justify abortion when it is the result of sex without contraception. That woman simply did not care that new life was created within her, and chose to have sex in the first place. We argue it's a woman's choice for abortion? No, It's a woman's choice to have sex without the means of contraception.

-------
Clarification - I believe contraception is OK because new life with unique DNA and a unique person has not been formed and therefore will not be removed from the world.</original_post>

    <text>What is the point of this CMV? You can believe it is wrong, but are you arguing it should be illegal? How does a woman prove that she used contraception (which then failed, resulting in the pregnancy) in order for you to approve her abortion? How do we practically impose a law that would make it legal for a woman to get abortion in some circumstances (rape, or if she used failed contraception) but not other circumstances? You can think abortion in certain situations is wrong - I might even agree with you (and your reasons) but how does it apply to the legal abortion debate?</text>
