    <title>CMV: My pregnant wife shouldn’t seek the COVID vaccine</title>
    <original_poster>Herpes_free_5ince_03</original_poster>
    <original_post>So my wife and I have both had COVID in the past and both tested positive for antibodies. I am double vaccinated but my wife has not yet received any. She is approx. halfway through pregnancy and we can’t decide if she should get the vaccine or not, mostly due to unknown impact on the baby and a lack of long-term studies. She works from home permanently so her exposure to others is significantly decreased.

We are not against a vaccine, just feel like we need more info to make an informed decision. She is undecided, I am leaning towards no.

* I firmly believe it is her body and her choice and this post is for info only. She will ultimately make the decision herself

Edit: 

When she contracted COVID before her health was not significantly impacted and she has made a full recovery with no long-term noticeable effects.

Different healthcare professionals have advised different things. Some say to get the vaccine now, some say to wait until the baby is born, one has said to wait until after breastfeeding. The lack of coherent advice is one reason for her (and my) reluctance.

She is permanent work from home with very limited contact with others, when outside we follow all guidelines, wear masks, sanitise and are otherwise very aware of the risk of transmission.

We are not in the US and the vaccine offered is Pfizer.</original_post>

    <text>Canada vaccinated the pregnant women first (I.E. if you were pregnant you could get it right away) it hasn't been associated with anything.

Your wife doesn't currently share a blood supply with the child. If she were for example to develop HIV, the child wouldn't be affect by it.

If the vaccine is injected into the blood supply it would be unlikely for it to be transmitted to the child in Utero.

Your wife is at a low risk of contracting Covid, but she's at a lower risk of complications. If she was to develop Covid during her pregnancy 95%&amp;gt; of the active ingredient of the vaccine would be present her body.</text>
