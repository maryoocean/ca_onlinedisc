    <title>CMV: While the GME squeeze is a powerful display of retail trader’s power, there is no endgame that doesn’t result in them losing massive amount of money.</title>
    <original_poster>ticklemytaint340</original_poster>
    <original_post>The GameStop squeeze carried out by r/wsb and others demonstrated the power of retail traders and seems like a fair punishment on market makers and hedge funds that have taken advantage of the stock market for ages, but there is no way that it will end well for them. Sure, a lot of stock brokers have lost millions on shorts because retail traders refuse to sell and are still buying, but they can afford to do so because they have enormous amounts of cash to rest on and because GME is clearly overvalued. GME’s market cap is several times its revenue, and the only reason it is that high is because of the artificial demand created by internet communities. At some point, sellers are going to fold and GME is going to collapse, and everybody that purchased it when it was overvalued is going to lose massive amounts of money, while Wall Street short sellers laugh their way to the bank.</original_post>

    <text>Well, that's kind of the point.

The people buying up GME aren't necessarily doing it so they can make money. They're pulling a stunt because it's *funny*, and if they lose a little bit of money as a part of it, that's the cost to them of doing something they wanted to do.

&amp;gt; while Wall Street short sellers laugh their way to the bank.

Eventually that will happen. But plenty of them have already lost really big anyway. Whenever it does collapse, they'll still be a lot worse off than they would if none of this had happened.</text>

    <text>They’re not pulling a stunt at all, they have invested literally billions of dollars, and many people have put their life’s savings on the line because some armchair investors told them too. Look I have my qualms with Wall Street, but these people don’t get MBAs and Econ PhDs for shits and giggles. I promise you that the second that the bigger guys in WSB have the end in site, they’re going to offload their stock and GME is going to tank.</text>

    <text>They didn't though... Melvin recapitalized and unwound the position. Honestly I'd be shocked if they didn't put the short back on if the price runs up again before coming back down.</text>

    <text>No way to really know what their capital position was before the new injection. My guess is they would have been fine if they didn't face large redemptions, but don't know enough about their structure to know either way.</text>

    <text>Why would you need a $3B loan if you weren’t in trouble?</text>

    <text>It wasn't a loan, it was a direct investment in the fund. 

A couple of possible reasons:

\-Shore up capital position in the event of large redemptions:

\-Allow them to enter compelling trades without liquidations.

\-Reduce their reliance on short term borrowing.

\-Favorable terms on revenue share in a fund that they believe will do well over time.</text>

Ah. Anyone who's put their life savings on the line is absolutely an idiot if they don't get out quick. But tens of thousands of people pay hundreds of dollars every day just to say hello to computer-generated anime waifus while they're streaming Minecraft, I don't doubt that a lot of people who don't really care if they lose money could screw up the value of one particular stock for the sake of a meme.</text>

    <text>Tens of thousands of people investing 100s would have raised millions. Billions have actually been spent. People are going to get hurt all to topple a couple of hedgies, who will all still be rich.</text>
