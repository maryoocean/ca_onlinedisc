    <title>CMV: The ESRB rating system is frivolous and inaccurate</title>
    <original_poster>Aid2Fade</original_poster>
    <original_post>My parents prevented me from playing games rated above the ESRB required age. I don't think this was helpful or necessary, and in fact I experienced a short period afterwards where I specifically sought out games like CoD for the novelty of it. I understand that people may find the concept of violence grotesque, but video game violence is incredibly cartoonish. Not many people, or children I'd think, would belabor under the illusion that the silly video game blood on-screen has anything to do with what a realistic analogue would entail. I've even heard from people that it helps get aggression out of their system. Additionally, things like innuendo, violence, and 'bad language' are lumped together without any real way to differentiate. Even if I accept that there's benefit in controlling content, there doesn't seem to be a way for a parent that would want to pick one or two factors to actually choose. But beyond the value to isolated households, even if you tell your kids to not play M games, someone else's parent isn't going to care and will probably just let your kid play one at their house. Plus, if the concern is language and innuendo, they run into those at school anyway. And instagram is hardly sparing either. I just feel like the ESRB wasn't that useful at first and is now even more of a dinosaur.

    <text>Parents may not want their kids to be exposed to violence or nudity, for a number of reasons. The rating system does not ban parents from buying those for their children.

That kids are bound to see such things at friends house is not a foregone conclusion. My friends parents would check with my parents before letting me watch pg13 movies before I was 13. They didn't really check about games, but when I was a kid video game violence (I should say gore) was less common, and what did exist was heavily pixellated. Maybe if games were what they were now they would have checked.

Even if they ARE going to see them at friends houses, occasional exposure to violence and nudity is not the same as continuous exposure.

Your current belief seems to be "parents should expose their kids to everything because they're going to see it anyway," which isn't a belief you can really push on other parents. If you can agree that its ok for parents to decide they don't want their kids regularly exposed to certain things, then the value of ESRB makes sense.</text>
