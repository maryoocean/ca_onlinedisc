    <title>CMV: Modern marriage in the US brings more harm than benefit for men.</title>
    <original_poster>cannibalstreudel</original_poster>
    <original_post>I believe based on marriage laws and divorce practices that marriage no longer has more benefits than harm for men.

For women it's the opposite. I believe this because whether laws state this or not, practices in divorce court often grant kids' custody to the mother from the father when they aren't more dangerous to their kids than their wife. And often men have to give up half their income/assets in divorce when they often make most of the income of the household.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Sure there are emotional benefits to a long term relationship. But there aren't extra benefits for men on top of an emotionally committed relationship that exclusively comes with marriate.

The security marriage itself brings is only for the woman. She gets to enjoy financial guarantee of sharing income when men often make more than women, and she can be assured of his fidelity - it's backed up by government enforcement... women rarely are punished for fucking another guy and being impregnated at the level men are, and often the man in the marriage gets cucked and is made responsible for raising another man's child.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Men are bringing unnecessary vulnerabilities on themselves when they marry a woman in modern US courts.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

If someone can reliably demonstrate that marriage gives more potential benefit to men than potential harm, I would believe marriage brings more benefit than harm to men. And to be clear, I'm not talking about long term relationships, I'm talking about specifically signing a marriage document and putting the law behind the union.</original_post>

    <text>Why mention custody? It’s an issue whether they are married or not, and I doubt not being married to the mother would *increase* the father’s chance at custody. Take a look at [this article](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/child-custody-faq.html). The reason more women get more custody is because it’s more common for fathers to concede custody to the mother. </text>

    <text>You can’t just make a CMV post and not participate for 5 hours. That would break Rule E.</text>

    <text>Exactly why I'm stating it. I'm sure the moderators would understand I don't want to lose my job. Got a quick break will reply again in 4 hours or so.</text>

    <text>I just read the article. That's great! If this is implemented fairly in reality then awesome. I'd want to see that this is, in fact implemented without bias in practice, not just in the books, and this would go a long way to changing my view. I would still need to see that similar fairness is implemented both in law and in practice for financial fallouts in divorce and I'd also need to be convinced that the benefits attributed to marriage are exclusive to marriage and aren't also available to those in committed long-term relationships in general.</text>
