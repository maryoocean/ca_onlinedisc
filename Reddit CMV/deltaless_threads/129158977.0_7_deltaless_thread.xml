    <title>CMV: I believe that abortion as a result of consensual sex (without contraception) is wrong.</title>
    <original_poster>BreakinMyBallz</original_poster>
    <original_post>I feel as though women who choose to have sex without the means of contraception, simply don't care if they get pregnant. They put their pleasures over the risk of having a child and having it terminated. 

I feel as though, when the sperm and egg mix, they create a completely new set of DNA, DNA that has never been the same in the entire history of our species and is a completely unique person (I'm not Theist, I try to base my arguments on the uniqueness of each person)

I don't see any way for someone to justify abortion when it is the result of sex without contraception. That woman simply did not care that new life was created within her, and chose to have sex in the first place. We argue it's a woman's choice for abortion? No, It's a woman's choice to have sex without the means of contraception.

-------
Clarification - I believe contraception is OK because new life with unique DNA and a unique person has not been formed and therefore will not be removed from the world.</original_post>

    <text>I see you talking about women an awful lot, but it takes two to tango. Are you implying men have no responsibility here?</text>

    <text>Men don't get pregnant, it is the woman's job to prevent it if she doesnt want a child, even if she needs to tell her boyfriend or whatever to use a condom.</text>

    <text>Men may not get physically pregnant, but once the child is born, men will presumably share the responsibilities of caring for the child together with the woman. It's not like pregnancy is consequence-free for men. I'd say the responsibility is on the man as much as it is on the woman. 

Accidents happen. Contraception can fail, it can be forgotten, either partner can be deceptive about having used it. Women have abortions for any number of reasons. What if the parents are poor and have no means to care for a child, or perhaps are mentally or physically incapable of doing so. I guess my point is do you support bringing a new life into this world even if that life is guaranteed to be a miserable one?</text>
