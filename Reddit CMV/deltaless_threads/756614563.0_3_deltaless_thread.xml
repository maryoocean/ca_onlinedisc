    <title>CMV: It should be illegal to have a pitbull that isn't spayed or neutered</title>

    <original_post>Should be self-explanatory. I don't think we should straight up ban the breed, but getting such a dog fixed should be a legal requirement for owning one. Un-neutered dogs are \[responsible for the vast majority of serious attacks\]([https://www.avma.org/Advocacy/StateAndLocal/Pages/dogbite-summary.aspx](https://www.avma.org/Advocacy/StateAndLocal/Pages/dogbite-summary.aspx)) according to the AVMA. This would also result in a pit bull population decline which would reduce the huge number of pits clogging up shelters.</original_post>

    <text>Why would it only be pitbulls? That seems very unfair. Most cases of aggression do come from dogs that aren't spayed or neutered, but if you want to slowly kill off pitbulls, you'd also have to get rid of rottweilers, boxers, german shepherds, and the list just keeps going. Dogs are fiercely loyal to their owners, but not every owner has good intentions. You also have to consider why the dog got violent. If someone got too close to a frightened dog, then they should expect to have to pull away or get bit. Guard dogs are often labeled as 'bully breeds' because they are territorial, it's their job. Not every pitbull is violent, not every golden retriever is friendly. Dogs vary, their breed and their personality are not entwined.</text>
