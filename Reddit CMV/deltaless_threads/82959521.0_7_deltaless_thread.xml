    <title>In the Israel v. Palestine conflict, Israel is by far in the wrong and the US should cut ties with the country. CMV</title>

    <original_post>It seems all that I've seen about the conflict, is Israel either taking over Palestinian territory that isn't rightfully there's, imprisoning innocent Palestinian people, and making Palestine out to be the bad guys.

To me, it seems like all of the violence caused by Palestine is just an attempt to raise attention to their cause. I would necessarily agree with that, but their point is still valid.

    <text>I will not address the portion of your post that assigns blame to one side or the other.

I will say that if I had a time machine and could go back, I would advocate never getting involved.  

However, we have thrown our hat into the ring for Israel.  Regardless of what we do from here on out, we will anger at least one side of the conflict (if we out and out support one side over the other) and possibly both (if we try to be in the middle of the road and back off supporting Israel so much).

Bascially we have made our bed and it is now too dangerous/volatile to not lay in it.  </text>
