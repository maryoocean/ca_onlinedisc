    <title>CMV: Regardless of your view on abortion everyone should support universal access to contraception</title>
    <original_poster>Bagool88</original_poster>
    <original_post>Like the title suggests, I think that supporting increased access to contraception (especially birth control) is in everyone's best interest regardless of whether they are pro-choice or pro-life. If you're pro-life, easier access to contraception ensures that lower rates of unwanted pregnancies which should then lead to fewer abortions. If you're pro-choice, nobody *wants* unplanned pregnancies to occur, they just want women to have the option available so that a mistake doesn't ruin their lives. 

That being said, I don't see how anyone could be against increased or even universal access to contraception and birth control in particular. Yes condoms are readily available and cheap, but 1) condoms don't feel good so a lot of people make the stupid mistake of not using one, and 2) [birth control is more effective than condoms](https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/bc-chart.html). It seems that both sides would either benefit from or support fewer unwanted pregnancies, so why would anyone ever not support increased access to contraception? 

Edit: Wow this post blew up overnight. Most of the arguments I'm seeing against my view is that since condoms are both cheap and easily accessible that we do have some form of universal access to contraception, or that universal access to the pill would inevitably mean that it would be provided through tax dollars. My problems with this are I've said, condoms aren't immensely effective and work ~ 82% of the time, and while not wanting your tax dollars to go into funding the pill is absolutely a valid and reasonable view to have, neither of these views actually solve the problem of how to prevent unwanted pregnancies. I'd like to open up the discussion and ask those of you opposed to funding the pill with tax dollars how you would propose we lower the rates of unplanned pregnancy. If anyone can come up with a reasonable solution that doesn't involve the use of tax spending I will gladly give a delta. Thanks for the reasonable dialogue so far everyone!                </original_post>

    <text>As many other responses have said, we do have universal access to contraceptives – no one is barred from purchasing them. It seems that by “universal access” you mean free (governemnt paid for) birth control, though, which I take issue with. Essentially, I should not have to foot the bill for someone else’s irresponsible behavior. If you aren’t in a position to take care of a child, then you should either use birth control or not have sex. If you have sex, then *you* are responsible for the results of your actions, not me.

Additionally, there are people who believe that birth control is immoral. They don’t get to dictate someone else’s decision to use birth control, but you shouldn’t be able to dictate that they pay for something they view as inherently wrong. The same goes for abortions.</text>

    <text>The government pays for many drugs that are important for people’s health, why not birth control?

The vast majority of people use birth control for a primary purpose other than avoiding being pregnant. We should treat it like any other medication that is needed for someone’s health instead of allowing people who need it for legitimate health reasons suffer due to a minority of people. </text>

    <text>The government shouldn't be paying for any drugs at all, but that's a different issue.</text>

    <text>That’s fair. But as long as the government is, it is not fair to pick and choose, they should cover all essential health-related medications the same. </text>

    <text>I can understand the point of view as well, though elective medication such as birth control is significantly cheaper than most drugs, and thus more easily obtained. I think it would be a mistake to involve the government in a market that has so successfully lowered prices by itself, and will presumably continue to do so.</text>

    <text>Birth control can cost up to $50 a month, that’s certainly not cheaper than most meds. (Viagra is $30 for example and is covered by insurances/government)</text>
