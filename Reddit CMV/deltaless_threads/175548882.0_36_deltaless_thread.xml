    <title>CMV: Public transportation should run 24/7.</title>
    <original_poster>Keep-reefer-illegal</original_poster>
    <original_post>We live in a world that is no longer 9-5. Businesses stay open later, friends can reach us with a portable device simply by typing on a mini keyboard. It doesn't make sense that public transportation isn't 24/7. Here are some reasons why it should be 24/7:

1. Very few buses run at 2 am for last call, I feel like if nothing else, running buses later let's responsible drunk people take public transit instead of driving home. 

2. It would benefit the working poor who may work night shift 

3. As mentioned before our world is now 24/7 

Those are my arguments. 

I encourage you all to change my view 

Edit: by transit I am including trains, buses, all forms of public transportation, not just buses.

    <text>&amp;gt; responsible drunk people take public transit

I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that you're talking about a very small customer pool. Taxis are available 24/7 nowadays with Uber and other such apps. So you're looking at people who want to get drunk, but don't have enough money for a cab, and are also responsible. If you're responsible, you can shave two drinks off your night and get that cab. 

The point is very few people need the service, so how can you justify it? Here in Peru where I live, Buses charge 50% more after midnight, and they run roughly 1/3 of the buses as they usually do. That creates a justifiable offset. But to run the full fleet 24/7 is simply wasteful.</text>
