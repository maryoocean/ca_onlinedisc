    <title>CMV: Adding rape as a legal punishment would be good for society.</title>
    <original_poster>kimagical</original_poster>
    <original_post>This started off as a showerthought but I couldn't find any reason this isn't legit, so here we go.

We need to add rape to the legal system as a viable additional punishment for heinous crimes.

I know what you're thinking. But it's not an unsually cruel punishment.

We already have the death sentence, and if not that, then life sentences of solitary confinement, which virtually all experts-- including official statements from the United Nations-- agree is torture.

And if you're a prisoner today, sometimes you are *already* getting raped. Other times you go "gay for the stay".

So don't tell me adding rape as a legal punishment is anything unusually cruel or sinking lower morally.

If anything, this would help guards regulate "safer" condom-provided prison rape, like how weed became regulated and safer after it was legalized in Canada.

So it's not much of a negative. But why is it a positive?

Here's why: there's a rapidly rising population of involuntary celibates. In the last 10 years alone, the population of these "incels" doubled from 12% of the young male population to 24%.

This is 45,000 incels ballooning to over 100,000. These incels have been behind an alarming number of mass murder sprees.

Every day incels on the dark web discuss organizing terrorism.

There's no fancy peer-reviewed study on that last bit yet-- but I've seen this happening with my own eyes by digging around social media years ago.

I found massive and highly active online communities who worship Elliot Roger and egg each other on to muster up the courage to flatten people with trucks. Buy automatic weapons and kill.

If the population is given free license on their own time to rape any inmates who have been handed the punishment of rape, this could solve some of the incel problem.

It *may* not help; obviously there's no proof in this area. It would be a moral wild west, but there's no time to wait. Innocent people are being shot to death.

It would be far more immoral to not at least try this preventative measure when there are innocents being murdered.

This availability of prison sex slaves with no bodily rights would also directly compete with street prostitution, lowering the demand for a dangerous and morally questionable industry, at best saving two birds with one nest.

At worst, we realize it's not helping and we revert the program. My view is that there is enough reason to try it.</original_post>

    <text>&amp;gt; I know what you're thinking: but it's not an unsually cruel punishment.

I'm not american so my first thought was human rights.

&amp;gt; We already have the death sentence

*We* sure as shit don't.  It's in the constitution that the death penalty is abolished.  That's the Belgian constitution if you're wondering, articles 14bis and 18.

&amp;gt; So it's not much of a negative

I'm sorry, is your argument really, we're already doing inhumane things to people so it's not that much of a negative to do *more* inhumane things to people?  That's some twisted logic.

&amp;gt; Every day incels on the dark web discuss organizing terrorism.

Citation needed.

&amp;gt; I've seen this happening with my own eyes by digging around social media years ago.

And yet, no organized terrorism committed by home grown terrorists has occured yet?

&amp;gt; Buy automatic weapons and kill.

So you're arguing to basically ban private gun ownership?  Great, I can support that.

&amp;gt; this could solve some of the incel problem

So you want to take people that you describe as having a deep hatred for society and have society do inhumane things to them?  Again, that's some twisted logic.

&amp;gt; It would be a moral wild west

Well yes, many crimes against humanity happened during "manifest destiny".  So I can agree with this statement.

&amp;gt; People are being shot to death

Yet you're not here trying to stop people from shooting by taking away guns.  Why?

&amp;gt; It would be far more immoral to not at least try this preventative measure when there are innocents being murdered.

Like removing guns from the streets?  Like having affordable, stigma free mental healthcare?  Like having a decent education system?  Like having a social safety net?  Notice how none of these suggestions have even the slightest hint of being a crime against humanity.  But they do cost a bit of money.

&amp;gt; with no bodily rights

And there it is, a direct call to crimes against humanity.

&amp;gt; also directly compete with street prostitution, lowering the demand for a dangerous and morally questionable industry

There's plenty of countries around the world where prostitution is decriminalized or legalized.  Making this industry less morally questionable because it can be regulated.  For example, making pimps illegal.</text>

Regardless of whether I support banning guns, that's not part of the premise because I'm assuming that's never going to work in the US. Even if such a ban occurred too many Americans would keep their guns anyway, especially the ones with bad intentions.

&amp;gt;So you want to take people that you describe as having a deep hatred for society and have society do inhumane things to them? Again, that's some twisted logic.

I didn't say we'd punish incels by raping them. I meant that this would immediately provide the public free government provided sex, thereby making "involuntary celibates" at worst voluntary celibates.</text>
