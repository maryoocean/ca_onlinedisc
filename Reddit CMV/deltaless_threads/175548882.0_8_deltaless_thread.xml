    <title>CMV: Public transportation should run 24/7.</title>
    <original_poster>Keep-reefer-illegal</original_poster>
    <original_post>We live in a world that is no longer 9-5. Businesses stay open later, friends can reach us with a portable device simply by typing on a mini keyboard. It doesn't make sense that public transportation isn't 24/7. Here are some reasons why it should be 24/7:

1. Very few buses run at 2 am for last call, I feel like if nothing else, running buses later let's responsible drunk people take public transit instead of driving home. 

2. It would benefit the working poor who may work night shift 

3. As mentioned before our world is now 24/7 

Those are my arguments. 

I encourage you all to change my view 

Edit: by transit I am including trains, buses, all forms of public transportation, not just buses.

    <text>We have 24/7 buses on some routes here (Nottingham, UK) and most of these are run by a private company, so I assume not at a loss.</text>

    <text>Yeah, I assumed that night buses were normal, we have plenty of them in Edinburgh (although our bus service is mostly owned by the council)</text>

    <text>They probably do research to pick the right routes. It seems op just wants all public transit to run 24/7</text>
