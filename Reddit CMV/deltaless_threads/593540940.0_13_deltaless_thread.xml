    <title>CMV: Tipping makes no sense</title>
    <original_poster>adashofasshole</original_poster>
    <original_post>The general logic I hear behind tipping is because the driver or waiter does not make enough money. 

Well how is it the consumers fault that they are not making enough money? I can see the fault being placed on the employer for not paying enough, or even the company, but to place the responsibility on the consumer is completely lost to me. It would make more sense to me to even blame the employee for not working harder to find a better paying job (not the main point). 

The equivalent would be expecting kids to bring in money to give to underpaid teachers, which makes a lot more sense to me as students in public schools are not paying teachers for their service. 

Please, change my view. 

Edit: I still give my fair share of tips, also I understand it is not mandatory but it is highly frowned upon when someone doesnâ€™t tip. </original_post>

    <text>I think it's a perfectly sensible way to compensate people whose economic value isn't captured in the wage they earn, and also a way to acknowledge that the wage they earn (a low one) is largely a result of the fact that they lack bargaining power in the modern economy, because there are so many substitutes for their labor. 

This wouldn't be the case with teachers in public schools, for example, because they collectively bargain through unions and because they need licenses to practice their trade, which restricts the supply of labor in their industry.

Maybe tipping would disappear if service industry workers were all unionized and had to have licenses! </text>
