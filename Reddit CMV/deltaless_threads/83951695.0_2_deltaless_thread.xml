    <text>Alright here is a clarification. I'm having this argument with a friend, who roughly believes the statement at the top of the post. Aside from arguments based on some sense of common humanity and the monstrousness of it all, I can't come up with an argument that will shut his views down. </text>

    <text>You, or him?  I thought your friend was the one with the view that the population should be reduced drastically, not you.  Well, if that's your view too, at least you get points for being morally consistent.</text>
