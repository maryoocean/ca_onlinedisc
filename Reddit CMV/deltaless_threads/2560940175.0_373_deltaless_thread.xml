    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>At least in my experience studying and living in Germany I never encountered someone who got annoyed that I called myself American.  It’s also the official term for my nationality when I need to say the people from my country.  As you’ve said, the only people who seem to get pissed are a few people from Latin America, and at least in my experience here, I have yet to meet someone from Latin America that cares that I call myself American.  At least for the English language, I don’t see a reason why people from the US shouldn’t be called Americans, first big colony to achieve independence and so got to pick the name, people can do whatever they want in their own languages.</text>
