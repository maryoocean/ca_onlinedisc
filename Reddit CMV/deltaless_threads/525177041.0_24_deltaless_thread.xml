    <title>CMV: Pride parades should have less NSFW content</title>
    <original_poster>punmaster29</original_poster>
    <original_post>To preface, I'm bisexual and I love pride month and pride parades. However, I think that the amount of inappropriate content impedes some of the intent behind pride. 

To me, pride is about celebrating the LGBT+ community and promoting acceptance and understanding. It's about not being ashamed of who we love and what we identify as, and being able to share that with the world. 

I think the parade would ideally be a great place to bring our families, to show parents and children how incredible and talented the community is. I'm not out to my family, but bringing them to Pride would be a great start towards warming them up to accept me. But generally given the amount of public nudity and sexual inappropriateness at Pride, this is pretty much out of the question. 

In order to be more inclusive and celebrate love with as many people as possible, I think pride parades should tone down the sexual undertones and focus more on the concepts of love, pride, celebration, and acceptance. </original_post>

    <text>Do you think the same of other parades and celebrations? Should people stop getting drunk and hook up at the St Patrick's Day Parade? Should women keep their tops on at Mardi Gras? Should the dancers at the Brazilian Carnival wear more modest outfits? Big celebrations like that are usually a place for people to get drunk and hook up.</text>

    <text>As a disclaimer, I live in the SF bay area... probably the world's most out and out haven of gay activity. So our pride parades can be a little more on the extreme side. 

That said, I've attended hundreds of events and festivals in the city... none even came *close* to the level of debauchery that pride parades exhibited. At other gatherings, you might see a topless chick here... a drunk couple stumbling into a bathroom to have sex there... but pride is on a whole nother tier. I'm talking dudes dressed like butterflies with assless chaps on public trans. I'm talking hordes of dudes with cock-ringed dicks out marching the street. I'm talking open displays of BSDM rigs on the corner. I'm talking you glance down an alley and see half a dozen gay dudes blowing and fucking one another. 

Just saying, I get that festivals in general are a hub of debauched activity... but I get OP's point that you could bring a child to *most* of these events and still have it be family friendly, whereas pride is not. 

Fun side story: that actually happened to me in my youth. Mom went to take me to a play in SF when I was 9. Apart from RENT, the play in question, being a rather ill-advised choice for a boy of 9, it also happened to coincide with a pride event in the city. Needless to say, my mom was barraged with questions like "mommy, why does that man have another man on a leash, and why is he wearing a black spandex mask?" or "mommy, what are those pieces of metal that lady has in her vagina?" </text>
