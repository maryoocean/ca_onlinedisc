    <title>CMV: Premeditated 1st degree murder is never absolutely and objectively the wrong thing to do.</title>
    <original_poster>eobversion1</original_poster>
    <original_post>Murder being morally wrong is determined by a consensus of opinions of the electorate, supported by politicians and written into the constitution of every country. I would argue that differences in circumstance and moral relativism will never make it a black and white issue. It's easy to think of it that way and most people take it for granted. Even in cases of genocide there was conviction on the part of the perpetrator that it was somehow morally justified, you and I may viciously disagree with their stance and international criminal courts might put them to death because of it but to them and at that moment it was the right thing to do.

    <text>Well, it would depend on whether you wish to live in a civil society or not. Most societies that care about maintaining some code of civil behavior will agree that killing somebody who poses a legitimate threat to you or someone you care about is not wrong; it's just self-defense. But if somebody breaks into your house and kills you in your sleep, that violates most sane codes of civil behavior and, therefore, that's considered wrong in most civilized societies. You could probably argue about taking preemptive action to destroy a perceived threat, but unless you can conclusively prove that X group of people poses a threat to your existence, you're just going to remember as somebody who killed a lot of people for no good reason.</text>
