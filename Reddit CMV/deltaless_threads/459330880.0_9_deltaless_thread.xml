    <title>CMV:The death of the CD/Album as the primary means of listening to music and music ownership is bad</title>

    <original_post>Growing up, I saw music delivery move from vinyl to cassette to CD, and now to streaming. My friends and I used to spend hours each month at the record store, browsing through new albums and searching for classics or hidden gems. We'd take them home, put them on and listen while reading the liner notes and digging on the cover art. In many ways, the cover art could be just as cool and compelling as a great record. 

Now, streaming has replaced record sales as everyone either downloads songs from itunes or creates their own playlist from spotify, pandora, or some other service. In the end, you don't actually "own" this music, you're essentially leasing it through whatever service you choose. You lose the tactile enjoyment of pulling vinyl from it's sleeve or opening a jewel case. You the lose the discovery of finding more than one great tune on a record. For example, Fleetwood Mac's Rumours had only four singles, so in today's age how would any discover the great tunes on that record like Second Hand News, Never Going Back Again, The Chain, or Gold Dust Woman?

While you can find all sorts of undiscovered music through streaming, you don't necessarily own it. IT might be a good companion because of its ease of use, but owning physical copies of the music you love is still superior to having a copy on your phone.

CMV, that streaming music is inferior to owning either vinyl or cd's of musical artists work.

    <text>Depends who you are talking about. From the supply side, yeah it's a bit of a nightmare, but if you are a consumer it's a dream come true. 20 years ago your music taste was extremely limited. Unless you were a maven or knew one, your taste was restricted to what you could afford, almost certainly a best hits of a group or singer pushed heavily on the radio. Anything too offbeat would have offended your ears initially and then proven too hard to find and capture for you to develop a liking for it. No wonder the Chilli Peppers were one of the biggest bands of the 90's. 

Nowadays, you couldn't be stopped if they wanted you to. Music is so readily available that you can find 10 versions of a song you never heard before all by people you may be familiar with and you won't pay a penny (beyond internet and premium streaming bills). You are quite simply spoiled rotten, and the ubiquity of music and cost of music now makes it seem cheaper or less important. This, however, is just you. Fleetwood Mac would absolutely be popular today, in fact due to the upwards creep of the gross number of music consumers (and people) on the planet, they would undoubtedly be even more popular had they been around now (not to mention the new medium allows for groups such as the Mac to get access to newer generations of fans like never before). Plus, the album isn't dead. Singles are riding high but look at artists like Kendrick, or Tame Impala, or St. Vincent, etc. They are judged by their records as a whole just as much as Nas, or the Beatles, or kate Bush were. 

As for the ritual of a physical copy, you can still do that. I and my friends have spent hours perusing town for record shops to waste time fawning over records we can't afford in. As much as things change, they stay the same. The difference is I have heard all the records before, or if I haven't, then I will very very soon. And it will be amazing quality, and if I like what I hear I can check out the rest of the catalogue, and if there are related artists I can listen to them too.
