    <title>CMV: OCD doesn't have to be debilitating</title>
    <original_poster>lookslikeamirac</original_poster>
    <original_post>A lot of people get ticked off a bit when someone says something like "I'm OCD about _____" because they don't think it's legitimate and they see it as undermining what people with 'real' OCD go through.

I understand that maybe it seems insignificant to someone who has to wash his or her hands 20 times before bed, but it doesn't mean it's not some degree of OCD.

A hypothetical situation:

There's a guy who always leaves the volume on an even number when he changes it. When he turns on the TV though, he doesn't check to make sure it's an even number. So if it's already odd when he turns it on, then it's fine.

He changes the volume and sets it to an even number. Then, his friend changes it to odd and steals the remote. It doesn't prevent the man from watching TV, but it makes him slightly uncomfortable because he knows it's odd and he asks for the other guy to change the volume to an even number. The man refuses, and both men go on watching TV leaving the first man a little uneasy. After a while, the friend goes to the bathroom and forgets about the remote/volume, and the first guy steals the remote back to change it back to even.

My claim is that the guy may still have OCD since it makes him feel uncomfortable. It doesn't mean he *has to* change the volume back but he'd greatly prefer it be on an even number and gives some small anxiety when he knows that's not the case. It's enough that the friend forgot about it, but he remembered and immediately changed it on the first opportunity. 

To change my mind please provide evidence that my situation or a similar one *can't* be OCD. There may be no way around a semantic argument since we're dealing with medical terms, but try to avoid it if possible.

    <text>Others have posted a lot of stuff about the technical term so Iâ€™ll give some anecdotal based on myself. As a younger child I was diagnosed as borderline OCD. This was due to my habits being considered causing me stress, but not being time consuming. 

I have the even number issue in a lot of things. Number of bites Iâ€™d take to eat food. If I have a cookie that takes 3 bites, I change the size of my bites to make it take either 2 bites or 4 bites. TV volume has to be an even number. When I drive I have to bring going an even amount for the speed, I prefer non digital speedometers for this reason. If Iâ€™m eating bite sized things like M&amp;amp;Ms, I have to eat them in twos. If the bag has an odd number, the odd number gets thrown out. 

If I see anything dirty, or touch anything that might be considered dirty, I have to wash my hands and mouth. Even if when wearing gloves. 

If Iâ€™m carrying more than $10 cash, then I pull my wallet out about once every 10 minutes to verify the cash is still there. This grows more distressful the more cash I am carrying. 

After pumping gas, I get back in the car, and then get out a second, sometimes three times to verify I put the gas cap back on correctly. I have been known to pull over on the side of the road shortly after leaving a gas station to verify this again. 

All counting of stuff is done four times. 

While alone neither of these take significant time or cause significant distress, added all up on a daily basis and the amount of stress this causes me could be considered debilitating at times. I make it a habit of avoiding as many of these situations as I can to limit the impact on my life. So I think you have to look at the whole of the simming habits and not just individual ones to determine the impact on a person. 

Also, it is CDO, with the letters in the correct order as they should be. ðŸ˜œ</text>
