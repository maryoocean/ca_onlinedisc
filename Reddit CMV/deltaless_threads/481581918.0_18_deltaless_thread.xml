    <title>CMV: If I'm not guilty, I want to be tried by a judge rather than a jury</title>
    <original_poster>Mimshot</original_poster>
    <original_post>In the American criminal justice system you have the *right* to a jury trial, but you are not obligated to exercise your right a jury. It's possible to have what's known as a "bench trial" where in addition to determining the admissibility of evidence, and sentencing if convicted, the judge determines guilt or innocence as well.

Jury trials are notoriously unpredictable, therefore if I'm actually not guilty of a crime, I want a professional judging my case. Historically, bench trials result in acquittals [more often than from juries](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/judge_v_judge). I understand wanting to be judged by someone who never saw inadmissible evidence, if I'm guilty but the evidence was illegally obtained, but if I'm actually not guilty, why should I take a chance with a jury?

Change my view.

    <text>You would change your tune very quickly when the Judge has a very clear bias and wants to see you rot in prison for eternity for something arbitrary or out of your control, like your skin color. Besides, the Jury's purpose is only to decide what is true and what is not. It's up to the Prosecutor to set the stage for the charge, and the Defendant's to make sure the charge isn't too ridiculous, and the Jury to call out any bullshit. The Judge makes the final call by using all the information available and if there's any problems in the process then you move up to the next level of court. Otherwise you just accept your charge and the process ends.</text>
