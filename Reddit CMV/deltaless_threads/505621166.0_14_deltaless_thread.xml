    <title>CMV: Activists should abandon the phrase "white privilege" because it alienates white people who didn't grow up wealthy</title>
    <original_poster>ShiningConcepts</original_poster>
    <original_post>Blacks are [more than twice as likely to grow up in poverty](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;amp;sortModel=%7B"colId":"Location","sort":"asc"%7D), [disproportionately sentenced for the same crimes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/16/black-men-sentenced-to-more-time-for-committing-the-exact-same-crime-as-a-white-person-study-finds/?utm_term=.b0e81ca325dc), [several percentage points ahead in terms of unemployment statistics](https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpsee_e16.htm), prone disproportionately to police arrests incl. for nonviolent drug usage, and the list goes on. There are a wide variety of issues minority rights activists bring up that are legitimate - I'm not here to dispute those. I fully support that fight.

My view here is that the usage of the phrase "white privilege" is wrong and should be retired. Many upper class white people are privileged as they are immune to the ripple effects of a racist history (and the modern day effects of racist police departments and shitty schools in minority neighborhoods). But for the poor white ones, which there are many, the phrase white privilege should be abandoned. Because it minimizes and implies less importance for the suffering countless poor white people had to go through - while blacks are disproportionately victims of all the things i mentioned, some whites are the victims of them to.

I understand why a white person who suffered hardship in their life would feel alienated by hearing someone throw around the term "white privilege" - the term asserts there is a privilege in being white. There is privilege in being rich, but not solely in being white. So, the term should be abandoned in the interest of not alienating poor white people from a legitimate movement that has legitimate concerns.

    <text>OP keeps firing back that the term white privilege is alienating to white people who do not feel as though they have benefited from their white privilege. It's like they showed up to the party because they were told there would be cake, but found no cake. So,  they want to stop talking about the cake. "We didn't get any cake, so there is no cake." But, the cake WAS there. A bunch of us saw it. We even had some. We're sorry that you didnt get any yet, but more cake has been ordered. There's always more cake. Unless you're black. This is white cake. 
I try to give people the benefit of the doubt and say that if something never happened to me, I might not think it was as important as the people affected by it do. But white privilege is both demonstrable and quantifiable to some extent. It exists. Australia exists even though you've never seen it. People get struck by lightning even though you've never been struck. I'm not much concerned about people's feelings. I'm concerned about their ability to understand the concept that things exist independently of their personal observations. </text>
