    <title>CMV: The only difference between AI (digital) life and human (physical) life is the material which sustains it</title>
    <original_poster>CarpeBedlam</original_poster>
    <original_post>To be clear, I’m talking about a theoretical AI which is designed specifically to be indistinguishable from a human, and accomplishes that goal. Also, I don’t necessarily mean an android that is physically equivalent (e.g. Ash from “Alien”), but just a digital consciousness living in a computer which is capable of replicating human behavior. At that point, I’m struggling to find a difference between the two that isn’t solely about the material required to sustain the life (blood, tissue, etc. for human life, silicon, copper, etc. for AI life).</original_post>

    <text>While I concede that a hypothetical AI that can reside in a bio-robotic body may be close enough to a 'human' in the context of fiction like in the Alien series and Blade Runner, yet the fact of the matter is that movie/fiction AI is very different than what AI is in reality.

Fictional AI has no bounds other than what the story teller writes. It isn't limited by real life problems and roadblocks.

The AI we have now is essentially a bunch of automated scripts that can sort through lots of data and complete basic tasks and write very crudely rendered articles.</text>

    <text>Yeah, I agree. In retrospect, my premise is flawed even if my view of its ramifications is sound.</text>
