    <title>CMV: In the future, we should have a privacy-focused AI research initiative to identify and end violence and crime.</title>
    <original_poster>AnimeVRexpert</original_poster>
    <original_post>What I mean is that in 5-10 years(or more), when AI is advanced enough to identify and understand with 99.9%+ accuracy exactly what people are doing, we should have them monitoring us worldwide, of course without any human being able to access the recordings. Why?
                                                                                               I 
I can't see many disadvantages to this if done right.
1- Crime would be 90%+ reduced and everyone enjoys a peaceful life because as soon as a crime happens, police would be notified instantly or maybe the AI itself could handle it.

2- Privacy will not only be maintained, it will be increased since there will be fewer excuses for human surveillance.

3- End of terrorism since AI would predict the act before it happens

4- AI could predict suicides and give statistics like "people are 30% happier in the UK" or something like it, helping the world become a much better place.

5- The possibilities are endless, we could save countless lives and help people live better in unimaginable ways.

Disadvantages:

People seem to be against this idea, I [posted a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/73r0uu/active_shooter_at_mandalay_bay_casino_in_las_vegas/dnswcz3/) about the recent tragedy that happened in LA and got massively downvoted(Maybe the part about the drones contributed, what I meant was an AI controlled pacifist drone that would only use tranquilizers so no one gets hurt), this means my view is probably wrong, and I realized now is a perfect time to use CMV.

Would appreciate if you could tell me why my view is wrong or maybe I just presented it the wrong way in the comment.     </original_post>

    <text>This sounds like a bad sci-fi movie where the program decides humans are the problem</text>

    <text>This is sort of kind of the plot of minority report. not exactly AI, but the same kind of idea.</text>
