    <title>I believe that prayer does nothing to change the world. CMV</title>

    <original_post>Prayer as an act of reaching to a deity for help or comfort has no appreciable effect beyond what can be achieved by normal positive thinking.

Praying to end world hunger or to get a job has no effect unless you or someone else makes the decision to achieve the goal. These goals could also just as easily be achieved without prayer.

Edit: I do not believe in the non corporeal nature of prayer. I do believe in the effects such as positive thinking giving someone a better understanding of who they are a what they can do.</original_post>

    <text>Even if god doesn't exist, prayer can be used for the placebo effect, and the placebo effect works. For example, experiments have been done where teachers tell their students that brunettes are smarter than blondes, then give them a math test. Of course, the brunettes do better on average. Then, a different teacher tells her students the reverse, and what do you know, the blondes end up doing better. Same thing applies with prayer. So if you pray for a new car, you are more likely to work harder to afford that car if you truly believe god has heard your prayers.</text>

    <text>He talked about positive thinking. I'm saying that there's a difference between positive thinking and actually believing that you are going to succeed. The latter is often more effective.</text>
