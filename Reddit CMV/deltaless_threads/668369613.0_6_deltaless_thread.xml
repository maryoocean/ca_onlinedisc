    <title>CMV: The question of "do we live in a simulation" doesn't matter</title>
    <original_poster>mix_420</original_poster>
    <original_post>I say this for two reasons:

1. You can't prove it. Can't really think of anything you can't explain with common sense that proves that we live in a simulation.
2. There's no point in it. I don't see how life changes in any way if you were to know you were in a simulation. I understand that knowledge is a great thing and we should try to get knowledge even if it doesn't matter, but because of #1 it makes it pointless.

Basically what I'm saying here is there's no point in asking this question if you will never have the answer to it, considering the only reason to ask the question is for the knowledge of it, as you'll never achieve it.</original_post>

    <text>An example of a book where the world is a simulation would be "The game is life". The main characters found out about the simulation by discerning how similar the world works to a game. And by knowledge of the world being a game, they could circumvent the rules because because the game took the thoughts of the players into consideration by determining the rules. 

In these cases it would be good to know if the world is just a simulation or not. </text>
