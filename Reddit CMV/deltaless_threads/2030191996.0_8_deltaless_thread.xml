    <title>CMV: It's fair to compare carnists (people who eat meat) to nazis.</title>
    <original_poster>Arkenhiem651</original_poster>
    <original_post>1) Carnists think that animals are inferior; Nazis think that jews are inferior
2) Carnists put animals in camps; Nazis put jews in camps
3) Both jews and animals attempt to escape
4) Both are/were normalized. Anyone who goes against these beliefs were/are suppressed and treated as illogical/emotionally driven
5) Both are unnecessary 
6) Both are/were driven long distances and murdered
7) emotional detachment from the victims
8) Both are sentient
Alex Hershaft a holocaust survivor also used this comparison along with other vegan holocaust survivors.
"We're focusing on the victims rather than the cancer of oppression itself",[8] and that "I noted with horror the striking similarities between what the Nazis did to my family and my people, and what we do to animals we raise for food: the branding or tattooing of serial numbers to identify victims, the use of cattle cars to transport victims to their death, the crowded housing of victims in wood crates, the arbitrary designation of who lives and who dies — the Christian lives, the Jew dies; the dog lives, the pig dies."[6

Also Alex Hershshaft looks extremely young considering he's 88 and survived concentration camps. That's irrelevant but I thought it interesting enough to mention considering he claims it's due to his vegan diet.

Edit: I know I say Jews but this also applies to other victims of the concentration camps such as Slavic peoples, gays and communists</original_post>

    <text>1. Meat eaters and Nazis aren't comparable, you could make the comparison with farmers maybe but eating something because you have to to live isn't the same as actually doing everything to the animal. Which leads to point two.
2. A lot of humans need to eat animal products to be healthy and even if this isn't a concern the diet isn't viable financially for most people and abstaining from eating meat isn't going to stop what's done to animals. If you do try to seriously rally people to stop eating meat this way it may make more animals just die for nothing, only those with power could actually change it.
3. Animals don't have the same mental capacity as humans and propensity to empathy, it is cruel what animals go through but it has a purpose it's not wanton cruelty it's to sustain life.</text>
