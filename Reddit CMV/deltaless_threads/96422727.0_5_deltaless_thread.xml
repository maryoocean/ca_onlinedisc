    <title>I think that if Israel had gained it's independence fair and square. CMV.</title>

    <original_post>So I know this is kind of political, but let's try to keep this on subject.

I'm a Zionist who is also an atheist, so let's try and keep religion out of this, because this is definitely not the reason I support Israel.

Thing is, there's this thing called "Romantic Nationalism", it's a form of nationalism in which the state derives its political legitimacy as an organic consequence of the unity of those it governs. 

In Israel's case that's religion and I'm pretty sure that that's how it got recognized as a state. I understand that a lot of people disagree with this because the land wasn't theirs to begin with and that just because some group claims an old book told them it is, is just a logical fallacy.

Problem is, almost the exact scenario happened almost 200 years ago with Finland. 

The Kalevala was a compilation of old Finnish folklore and mythology (Kind of like a bible, written to sum up oral mythology) During the Russian reign, the Finns tried to used the Kalevala to legitimize their nationality and gain recognition as a state. (Pretty much like the Zionist movements during the British mandate).

In case number one, there were people (Swedes) who lived on a territory that they used to own but was then taken by another country (Russia). The "natives" just accepted their fate and either returned to their land (Sweden) or became part of the ruling country (Russia). 

While this was happening. There was a second, much smaller group of people (The Finns) that claimed that this was their land long before the "natives" took over. With the use of a book that contained their mythology (Kalevala), they tried to gain independence from the ruling country. They did. (The Swedes eventually either moved to Russia or came back to Sweden).

In case number two, we see the exact same scenario. The Russians are the Britts, the Swedes are the Palestinians, the small group is the (now) Israelites and the Kalevala is the Jewish Bible.

The only difference, is that Britain didn't want to get involved like Russia did, and left the mess to the two rivals.

If this were the late 19th century, this whole conflict would never have happened.

TL;DR : The British were pussies and this whole thing got started just because the Palestinians wanted more land.</original_post>

    <text>While Israel's right to exist is certainly subjective and can always be simplified down to the argument "They won the war, therefor they have the right to exist"- A further examination brings up moral and ethical question, which must include both the current state of things and the basis for their existence. Without directly addressing the post holocaust argument FOR Israel which of course includes it's existence as a safe haven for persecution, I'd like to address the basis on which Zionism exists as the right of an ethnic group to CREATE their own sovereign state in the 20th and 21st centuries.

I'd argue that modern democracy tends to understand the importance of a separation of church and state- and that the idea of a "Jewish State" is at odds with this lesson.

Further- as you somewhat acknowledge in your post, Judaism is less of a religious identity as it is a cultural identity... but what we must admit is that this culture is based on a genetic preface.  Since there are different genes which have worked their way into jewish society- however that may have happened, we may characterize it as an Ethnic Identity, BUT it is largely a culture which identifies itself based on a genetic identity, even if that classification is shied away from for obvious reasons.

So, beyond evidence which shows a separation of church and state to be ideal in a democratic nation- would you agree that having an official state "Ethnicity" in this case is, in a sense, inherently racist? 

And in a global society where cultures are expected to not be isolated from one another, is it ethical to create artificial boundaries specifically to be governed by the ideology of a group which identifies itself by a genetic classification?</text>

    <text>A state organized under ethnic lines is not inherently racist. Or if it is then you can pretty much characterize every nation-state as racist. 

As for a Jewish state being at odds with separation of church and state, I'd say a lot of Jews and Israelis would agree to a certain extant. The monopoly on issues like marriage that the Orthodox rabbinate have is severely criticized by many Israelis. But that doesn't have anything to do with the justification for the state itself or the legitimacy of its founding. As you said, Judaism is less a religious as it is a cultural identity and that was the basis of Zionism and the establishment of Israel. Most Israelis (and Jews in general, really) are secular but still identify as Jewish.

Judaism does not in any way identify on genetic lines. I'm not sure where you're getting that idea. Jewish identity predates any understanding of genetics and converts and their descendants have always been accepted and treated as fully Jewish.</text>

    <text>Yes, it is a very secular culture.  So what is the culture based on?  A history and mythos of persecution, combined with a strong emphasis on lineage.  There are shared cultural values which arise from this identity, which include hard work and a strong cultural bond/sense of unity especially among friends and family, as well as the import of respect and conservation.

&amp;gt; Judaism does not in any way identify on genetic lines. I'm not sure where you're getting that idea. Jewish identity predates any understanding of genetics and converts and their descendants have always been accepted and treated as fully Jewish.

I don't think that's a reliable premise.  I'm not interested in disputing the semantics of "genetics", but the ethnicity is very focused on lineage.  It's not a religion which welcomes converts unless they are marrying in.  While technically matrilineal, you are typically only accepted as Jewish if you can prove Jewish ancestry.  I, for one, would never be able to go on a trip with Birthright.

An nation founded with a class system based on ethnicity (which bases itself on lineage) is oppressive in its nature.</text>

    <text>Of course Judaism is concerned with linage. It's an ethnicity. French, Japanese, English, Kurd, Arab, Russian, these are all ethnicities concerned with lineage. You can't just decide to be Japanese.

Judaism, as an ethnicity, is way more open in that you can convert. It isn't semantics.

That's a lot of variety for a group "very focused" on lineage.  Of course you wouldn't be able to go on a Birthright trip. You're not Jewish. Convert to Judaism and you can go. You don't have to prove Jewish ancestry. You just have to be Jewish. You seem to have a lot of misconceptions about Judaism.

&amp;gt;An nation founded with a class system based on ethnicity (which bases itself on lineage) is oppressive in its nature.

Partial list of countries organized under ethnic lines or defining themselves a nation-state for one particular nation: France, Japan, China, India, Sweden, The Netherlands, South Korea, North Korea, Spain, Portugal, Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, Georgia. And many, many others. When was the last time anyone who wasn't Japanese was elected to the Japanese Diet? Would that ever happen? When was the last time an Arab was elected to the Israeli Knesset? Every single election. Israel defines itself as a nation-state for the Jewish people. Nothing about that in and of itself makes it oppressive.

    <text>&amp;gt; While Israel's right to exist is certainly subjective and can always be simplified down to the argument "They won the war, therefor they have the right to exist"

I think it is more like "They exist, therefore they have the right to exist" 

Why does a man have the right to live ? Because he lives. I think there is a similar logic for the states. Every country has the right to exist because there is people inside them recongising this state as theirs.</text>
