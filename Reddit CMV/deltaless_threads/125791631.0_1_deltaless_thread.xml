    <title>CMV: Romantic love is a manifestation of the broader phenomenon of addiction</title>
    <original_poster>O_OY</original_poster>
    <original_post>I derive this view mainly from observing breakups, and drawing similarities to addiction.

1. When a breakup happens, often there is a craving for human contact (most of the time the subject is craving the ex). This craving is physiologically similar to the one that addiction uses (the VTA pathway).

2. Relationships often have the honeymoon phase, comfortable phase, etc. (I realize I'm not being very scientific here, but romantic love doesn't exactly have many scientific journals on it) This seems very similar to the tolerance that many addicts experience (first experience with a drug seems to be the most intense).

Please CMV! =(</original_post>

    <text>If you actually want to understand the how humans experience relationships, why not read a book on psychology or neuroscience rather than guessing? You're just making a big unsubstantiated leap for no reason. 

The world's more complicated than that. If you really want to have an informed opinion, then read into the subject matter. People have spent their entire lives researching this kind of thing. Want to know where to start? How about here: [The Neuroscience of Human Relationships](http://www.amazon.com/The-Neuroscience-Human-Relationships-Interpersonal/dp/0393704548/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1397351646&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=neuroscience+of+relationships).
