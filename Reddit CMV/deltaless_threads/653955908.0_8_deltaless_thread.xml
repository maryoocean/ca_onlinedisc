    <title>CMV: Equastrian sports should not be part of the Olympics.</title>
    <original_poster>LarryAndBarry</original_poster>
    <original_post>The Olympics in my opinion, is to challenge the boundaries of a humans physical abilities and see who is the best of the best. Its amazing what the human body is capable of when pushed to it limits.

I understand the same level of commitment goes into being a horse rider, but I feel as though equastrian sports is more a test for the horses. In theory, a javelin thrower can use any type of javelin but still throw a winning shot, but a rider can't really do the same with which horse he/she will use, therefore relying heavily on the horses ability to perform as well as their own. In the same vein, why not include the traditional horse racing with jockeys into the Olympics. </original_post>

    <text>Riding at Olympic levels takes a lot of athletic ability, strength, stamina, skill, and dedication. Just because the horse is also physically competing doesn’t mean the rider isn’t. With your argument, we could also say skiing isn’t a sport because they rely on the slopes, cycling isn’t a sport because they rely on the cycle, and swimming isn’t a sport because they rely on the buoyancy of the water. </text>
