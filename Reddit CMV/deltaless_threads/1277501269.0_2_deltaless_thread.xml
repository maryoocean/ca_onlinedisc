    <title>CMV: Redditors don't know shit about money</title>
    <original_poster>Yaqoob_</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have asked on multiple sub-reddits about the way money works. Its inception, supply, centralisation among other constituents. Most of the redditors answer in jargon language which doesn't serve any use. Divulging a bit, I have also hear that reddit doesn't turn a profit because the audience of reddit are merely keyboard warriors who don't have money to go out there and spend for advertisers to generate cashflow.

Also, kindly do suggest how I can understand things related to money (in simple language)</original_post>

It's not just Redditors but most people that lack a fundamental understanding of money. Even basic things like managing personal finances are not taught in schools and yet is probably the most important thing you can know.</text>

    <text>It isn't that people don't know shit about money. It may be that people we have encountered do not. There are people with plentiful money. Sometimes it seems they have a limitless source of it, like a printing press or something.</text>
