    <title>CMV: a better way to pay for college would be a wage percentage system</title>
    <original_poster>SaltySpursSupporter</original_poster>
    <original_post>instead of needing to take out thousands of dollars for student loans, maybe this is a better idea. instead of needing to pay money outright, negotiate a percentage of your future wage. depending on the program you're entering and the amount of years in that system, you can negotiate the percentage and the amount of years. if the person has a minimum wage job for the chosen amount of years, that's still all they get. i'm sure there are problems here that I haven't thought of. you're welcome to change my mind.</original_post>

    <text>Would the financier/school still get paid their full amount? eg They finance a 10k tuition. I then pay it back over 2 years if I made 50k/year and give them 10% each year?</text>

    <text>I think that is OP's intent. The idea is to make the financier care more about what majors they would sponsor and also make them invested in the candidate's placement. Perhaps, in this system, the financier could even get more money back as if it was an investment into the student.</text>
