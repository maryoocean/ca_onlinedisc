    <title>CMV: Adding rape as a legal punishment would be good for society.</title>
    <original_poster>kimagical</original_poster>
    <original_post>This started off as a showerthought but I couldn't find any reason this isn't legit, so here we go.

We need to add rape to the legal system as a viable additional punishment for heinous crimes.

I know what you're thinking. But it's not an unsually cruel punishment.

We already have the death sentence, and if not that, then life sentences of solitary confinement, which virtually all experts-- including official statements from the United Nations-- agree is torture.

And if you're a prisoner today, sometimes you are *already* getting raped. Other times you go "gay for the stay".

So don't tell me adding rape as a legal punishment is anything unusually cruel or sinking lower morally.

If anything, this would help guards regulate "safer" condom-provided prison rape, like how weed became regulated and safer after it was legalized in Canada.

So it's not much of a negative. But why is it a positive?

Here's why: there's a rapidly rising population of involuntary celibates. In the last 10 years alone, the population of these "incels" doubled from 12% of the young male population to 24%.

This is 45,000 incels ballooning to over 100,000. These incels have been behind an alarming number of mass murder sprees.

Every day incels on the dark web discuss organizing terrorism.

There's no fancy peer-reviewed study on that last bit yet-- but I've seen this happening with my own eyes by digging around social media years ago.

I found massive and highly active online communities who worship Elliot Roger and egg each other on to muster up the courage to flatten people with trucks. Buy automatic weapons and kill.

If the population is given free license on their own time to rape any inmates who have been handed the punishment of rape, this could solve some of the incel problem.

It *may* not help; obviously there's no proof in this area. It would be a moral wild west, but there's no time to wait. Innocent people are being shot to death.

It would be far more immoral to not at least try this preventative measure when there are innocents being murdered.

This availability of prison sex slaves with no bodily rights would also directly compete with street prostitution, lowering the demand for a dangerous and morally questionable industry, at best saving two birds with one nest.

At worst, we realize it's not helping and we revert the program. My view is that there is enough reason to try it.</original_post>

    <text>1. How will you find people that are willing rape others?
2. How much do they get paid? This also leads to how much it will cost to upkeep this
3. Even with protected sex, if someone has crabs/herpes for example, it can be transmitted (especially if the rapist is raping multiple people)
4. How do you know that the person being punished will be not ok with having sex? (They can be down bad for anyone)</text>

    <text>1. Incels are basically people who feel they are entitled to sex. They in theory would perceive this as their privilege. Hopefully they wouldn't consider themselves incels after.

2. No pay. Prison guards would oversee this stuff just like overseeing any other prison activity.

3. That's a risk they consented to the moment they committed a crime that warrants losing their bodily rights.

4. Don't see how this makes anything more problematic.</text>

    <text>For 4, if they enjoy being "raped", then it's not really a punishment right? 
If they enjoy it, then it's like a reward for commiting a crime</text>

    <text>I don't mind if the prisoner enjoys their community service, whether it's the sex kind or cleaning up parks. All the more power to them.

Whether they enjoy it or not, they would provide a normally extremely expensive and unregulated public service (prostitution) for free.</text>
