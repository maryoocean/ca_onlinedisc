    <title>CMV: Alpha males are actually 95 percent beta</title>

    <original_post>The others are human traffickers internet celebrities.  
I really don't believe this bullshit. I made a lot of observations in the military and people don't fit these patterns. The reason I'm writing this is because they contradict what they made up. they're all going after a few "alphas". but speaking by their rules, one alpha never follows another alpha. For example, andrew tat. This guy has millions of followers. most of them are men. others are probably female simps. now, if they are all alpha then what are all these alphas doing together? Why are alphas praising or defending andrew tate on the internet? All I see is adolescents who have not become individuals, have chosen a "male" role model for themselves from the internet. or, in their language, the alpha male gathered all betas around him.  
 just it. speaking by the book, an alpha never follows another alpha, when an alpha sees another alpha, he prepares for a fight. there is only one alpha in a group, there is no such thing as an assistant alpha. There are only loyal betas who take advantage of alpha. But, as far as I can see, these aren't even beta. fanboys only.  
Another contradiction (paradox?) "sigmas". I'll cut it short. why would a sigma have discussions with anonymous people on the internet about being sigma?   
Imagine that: Kai, the most famous sigma (who is a beyblade character, not kpop) is watching videos of the his sigma brothers to be cool (or make a girl). do you think this makes sense?</original_post>

    <text>what does it mean to be an Alpha male?

I think extrapolating from your post, its mostly about leadership.  An alpha male is a male that calls the shots.

I don't think being an alpha is about being excessively macho, cool, dominate etc.  Its about being a good leader to the people that follow you.  Its about preventing infighting in an organization and keeping everyone aligned on shared goals.  There was  a video on the front page a few weeks ago of one guerilla attacking another.  The silverback jumped into the fray and put a stop to it.  That's what makes him the alpha.


In the human someone like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk would certainly be alpha male, right?  They are (or were) the leaders of these massive organizations.  They lead their organizations to success by (among other things) keeping everyone aligned on the shared goals.

Neither Jobs nor Musk did it alone.  Musk was influence heavily by many other people, including jobs.  He posted his top 20 books of all the people who influenced him.  https://hbr.org/2004/05/coaching-the-alpha-male

I don't listen to Andrew Tate and I don't think he is a good role model.  but listening to the opinions of other people doesn't mean your not an alpha.  Not unless your going to say the wealthiest and most influential men in the world are not alphas.

I have two kids.  I lead them.  I mediate disputes between them.  I punish them when appropriate.   I keep their behavior in check.  In my family I'm the Alpha male.  Its not a compliment or something to boast about, its just a fact.  When the kids fight, I break it up.  My wife too, but not as much.</text>
