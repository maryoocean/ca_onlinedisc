    <title>CMV: r/childfree is a toxic sub</title>
    <original_poster>SosRashneer</original_poster>
    <original_post>childfree is toxic. The sub isn't about being childfree, its about hating children as a whole. When I see a post on childfree its always about someone hating on other peoples "Crotch goblins" or "little brats". Like sometimes the child will be doing nothing at all and they're like "ugh I hate the little fucker so much like keep your crotch goblins inside your own house."
And I never really see any thoughtful discussions going on there I always only see someone hating on some other peoples children. And when someone tries to defend the child they usually get banned or downvoted. And I understand the reasoning of a child being expensive as to not having one, but if you're complaining that they're selfish that's the parents job to fix, and annoying, that can also be fixed by the parent.</original_post>

    <text>Let me start by saying that I agree that r/childfree is a toxic place, having been a member for a short period of time and being childfree in my lifestyle.

That said, I'll contest your claim that there's never any thoughtful discussion over there. I won't go as far as to say that the discussions are always well-guided or even well-intended, but there are people who frequent that sub that are childfree because they believe they are doing a service to the world as a whole by reducing their carbon footprint. That kind of discussion isn't extremely prominent on the sub from what I saw when I was a member, but it was common enough, and I'd certainly call it thoughtful.</text>
