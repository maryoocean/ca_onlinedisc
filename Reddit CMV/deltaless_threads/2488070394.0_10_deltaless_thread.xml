    <title>CMV: People who surrender animals to the shelter shouldn't be required to do paperwork that identifies them or go on a 'sh*tlist' that prevents them from adopting from that shelter in the future.</title>
    <original_poster>ForsakenTakes</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'll start off by saying that I'm a licensed and registered veterinary technician who has experience working in clinics that do 'bulk' reduced cost spays and neuters for local humane societies and shelters.   
Yes, the sheer numbers of unwanted puppies and kittens- especially in the spring and fall -are next to impossible to keep up with. I hate seeing animals come in and out of the clinic that have been returned to their respective shelters, neglected, abused, or needlessly pregnant or intact as much as anyone else, because in the end it IS irresponsible people that cause these situations...   


However, I do not think that these shelters should be keeping what we call "shitlists" on people who responsibly surrender their pets they can no longer care for and go through the proper channels to surrender.   
What any shelter or rescue is doing by having you sign paperwork or anything regarding your surrender is basically adding you into a database of "irresponsible pet owners".   


Sometimes, this information is shared with surrounding shelters and rescues to deny future adoptions to people who've surrendered an animal *anytime in the past*. As far as I can tell, these databases are *forever*. If you surrendered a dog in 2002 because you lost your job and had to move into housing that doesn't allow pets for a few years, for example, they keep that surrender -and your reason- on file. And if you go in to adopt a pet today from that same shelter, you could be denied adoption because you're flagged in the system as an "abandoner". If your recalled reasoning doesn't match the original paperwork for surrendering an animal in the past -they will automatically deny you and assume the worst.  


I feel like making people identify themselves during the surrender process is counterproductive. The reason for this is it encourages blind dumping or abandonment at these shelters. We have so many pets left outside of these rescues/shelters that have requirements to fill out paperwork and provide identification that *more are dumped than people following protocol* by going in and physically filling out the paperwork. Because people know that they're going on some shit-list they don't know whom it will be shared with if they go in and "do the right thing".   


Sometimes these abandoned pets are left injured in crates- during the weekend or at night in harsh conditions when no one is there, simply because they fear being identified and judged for abandoning a pet they cannot care for. That's a big reason people re-surrender their animal- they get sick or get into an accident and the owner cannot afford the veterinary bills and are embarrassed and heart-broken.   
Allowing a 'no-questions asked' policy and 'baby boxes' have worked wonders for fewer unwanted babies being dumped in trash cans or irresponsibly on hospital property. Why can't we apply the same mindset to pets?   


I also don't feel like punishing someone for life is fair when people's situations change and improve all the time. Just because someone hit a rough patch 10 years ago and had to bring their cat back to the shelter doesn't mean they'll always be some irresponsible pet-dumper. (I think this is the reason they're so worried about the nature of the surrender, and want the paperwork in the first place.)   


Their hearts (shelters and rescues) are in the right place, but they're making things more difficult than they need to be when housing all of the pets that need it. There are way too many pets in need of homes to scrutinize potential owners to the point some of these shelters do. Some of these requirements are higher than many people in society hold to be a necessary threshold for caring for their own children and are excessive and ridiculous.   


TL;DR: Don't make people ID and "tell on" themselves when surrendering an animal because it makes more people just dump them instead. Also, don't just assume someone's a pos dumper for life just because they had to surrender in the past.</original_post>

    <text>Our local shelters have started to put security cameras out to identify "blind dumpers." They do not take extensive information from people surrounding pets, but do need to know the reason for the surrender - illnesses, bite history, etc - if they hope to rehome it.

  The other issue is that people will often surrender its older pet because it's not "fun" anymore and then go to another shelter to adopt a puppy. Shelters will often take information from the person surrendering the pet and share it with other shelters to try to avoid this.</text>

Yes, I agree that this is a really shitty thing to do. It sucks. It does. But keep in mind that old dogs have a shit-ton of health problems. Many become incontinent and start peeing and defecating all over the house because they simply can't hold it anymore and make it out of the house or are just so painful with arthritis and other conditions it's easier to just go right where they are. Many people can't be home or just can't deal with doggy diapers and expensive end-of-life medications and foods on top of the incontinence. It's sad, but this is a reason people will take their old pet to a shelter. Because it's simply no longer welcome in the home. Yes, people suck and shouldn't have a pet (or kids) if they have that throw-away mentality, but I can very much understand not wanting an incontinent pet in the home.</text>

    <text>You're absolutely right. I got a couple dogs, both age 10 because they had health issues the owner couldn't or didn't want to deal with. The shelter charged me "senior fees" - $10. I understand the difficulties of dealing, and I wound up with a couple great dogs.</text>

    <text>Then they shouldn't own a pet. A pet is not a toy that one returns when caring for them becomes difficult. These people should absolutely be on a shitlist. What happens to the old dog they surrender? It will most likely be euthanized. Then they'll adopt another animal and care for it until it becomes sick and unadoptable and then discard it just for it to be euthanized. I'm sorry but what about this behaviour is okay or understandable?</text>
