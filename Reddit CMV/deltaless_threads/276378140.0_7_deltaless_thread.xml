    <title>CMV: The fact there are certain weapons that I as a private citizen can't own is inconsistent logic of the use of the Second Amendment.</title>

    <original_post>The second amendment: A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

Arms: Weapons and ammunition; armaments

As you can see, the second amendment doesn't define what arms really mean, so I also provided Oxford dictionary's definition of arms. 

As a private citizen, there are certain weapons and ammunition that I can't own. To me this suggests that there is a certain definition of what constitutes arms and it's up to our current society and current legislature to define what that means. With the logic I am using, this means that guns aren't inherently arms or fall within the second amendment. It would not be unconstitutional to outlaw guns if society decides to do so. Guns aren't inherently protected under the second amendment in other words. It is only this current society and legislature that does include it.

So basically to sum up my argument and, at least to me, keep the logic consistent, I should be able to own any and all weapons available or guns aren't inherently part of the Second amendment.

Change my view!

Edit: Two redditors have succesfully convinced me that the second amendment does limit the owning of certain weapons. However this doesn't mean that my other view point has changed. Guns aren't inherently part of the Second amendment, and the outlawing of guns could still be possible without getting rid of the Second amendment

Second Edit: to clarify how to now change my view, you have to convince me that the limitations that aleady exist in the second amendment can't somehow be extended to any and all guns.</original_post>

    <text>Considering that this actually doesn't seem to have been posted, I would like to try to change your view by discussing how constitutional law balances the rights of the individual with the rights of society on the whole. You see, while the rights listed in the first ten amendments of the constitution *seem* absolute due to the way they were written, there are actually longstanding legal precedents for limiting them under certain circumstances. Most notably, it has been determined that the protection provided by these most basic rights can be weakened if upholding them would present undue danger to society. 

Most people are familiar with the most commonly presented example of this principle, as it applies to limitations on first amendment rights, such as not being legally protected if one shouts "fire" in a crowded public space (as resulting panic could lead to injury to others). However, many other rights have similar caveats that aim to serve the public good, such as government officials being able to enter private property without a warrant (in violation of the 4th amendment), if there is immediate risk of a person being harmed or evidence being destroyed.

In the case of the second amendment, this need for balance between ensuring the right of the individual to be able to bear arms, while also protecting the safety of the public as a whole, is both clearly evident and hotly contested. While its generally agreed that American citizens are guaranteed access to *some* forms of weaponry, there's good reason to put limits on this right in order to limit access to items which could cause destruction on a mass scale. It is this train of legal thought that has led to bans or restrictions on private ownership of fully automatic weapons, explosives, and certain types of ammunition, just to provide a few examples. However, debate still continues around what legal changes are needed to ensure that there is proper balance between individual and collective rights in regard to the second amendment, with some groups arguing that more restrictions are needed to provide protection from gun violence, in opposition to others whom claim that current legislation already goes to far. Since the arms we have access to are frequently evolving, and there is currently no way to ensure they are always used for legal means, this debate is likely to, and should, continue indefinitely to ensure the greatest degree of protection for the rights of all Americans.</text>
