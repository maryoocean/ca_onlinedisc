    <title>CMV: The USG can’t stop all of us, we could change this country tomorrow with direct action</title>

    <original_post>The institutions they run the US are horrendous.  

We have the worlds largest prison population, which maintains legal slavery.

Capitalist overlords hoard the majority of wealth while the working poor is real and growing.

For not the first time in kinda recent history concentration camps are back. 

My entire life I’ve been told things are the way they are, and there’s nothing to be done about it.  But that’s fucking bullshit. 

I don’t believe for a second that reforms will ever give power, real power to the people of this world. The teachers, the workers, the families that will grind through this hellscape as best they can for their entire lives, just trying not to go hungry on the streets.  

The State has a monopoly on violence. If we break that monopoly up, if we use that power for ourselves, against the enemies of humanity, maybe the world gets better sooner rather than later.</original_post>

    <text>What if people don't share your political views. Should those people take direct action on your people?</text>

    <text>Yeah. I sure don't agree with the OP, but he seems to think that everyone hates the US. It's actually really annoying that the view that he's building off of would make a much better CMV.</text>
