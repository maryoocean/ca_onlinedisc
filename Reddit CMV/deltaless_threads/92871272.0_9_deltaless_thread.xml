    <title>I don't think the NSA spying on us is such a big deal. CMV</title>

    <original_post>Here is my reasoning: growing up parallel to the development of the internet my parents always warned me that anything you put into a computer someone out there can see. It is permanent. So I have always assumed there is always someone watching. That assumption at the end of the day hasn't really changed what I put on the internet because everything is strictly my opinion and I don't care what others think of it.

As far as the recording of phone conversations and storing of email, that is just a case of national security. these things need to be saved in case someone is planning a terrorist attack on our nation IMO.	

I am just a normal citizen like many of you, but my opinion differs on this subject matter and I want to understand what the big fuss about it is. It has always just been a common knowledge and understanding for me that I am being watched.</original_post>

    <text>Well simply put: How many times have these extensive security efforts actually granted security and prevented an attack? I've heard of Canada thwarting more terrorist plots than the US despite relatively few law-enforcement tools for data gathering that don't require a warrant.</text>
