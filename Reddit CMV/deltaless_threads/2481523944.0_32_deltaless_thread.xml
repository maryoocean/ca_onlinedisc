    <title>cmv: Canada should install dirty atomic bombs in each big lake as an invasion deterrent.</title>
    <original_poster>maxi1134</original_poster>
    <original_post>With the upcoming climate changes and the fact that Canada has 20% of the freshwater reserve in the world. Russia, America, and other states might have an interest in invading Canada to access the water reserves and the Canadian north that will taw out and become available for crops.    
  

With this information, I believe that rigging the water table to be radioactive for eons in case of invasion would be the perfect deterrent to prevent the invasion from any other state.   

  

Especially America, as their water table would then also be contaminated</original_post>

The problem with fresh water isn't just that it's lacking, it's the difficulty of transporting it to where it's needed. This is already sufficient deterrent. 

Suppose Russia decides "we need 10,000 Gigalitres of water to supply the city of Putingrad. Aftre invading Canada at massive cost, it has to find some way to drain the lakes, melt the ice, and pipe this water thousands of kilometers across an ocean, through hostile territory, and then somehow get it to Putingrad.

It would be far easier and cheaper to buy water from its neighbours - even sea water, and then build a desalination plant.</text>
