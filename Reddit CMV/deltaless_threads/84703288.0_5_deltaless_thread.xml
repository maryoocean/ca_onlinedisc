    <title>There is no good alternative to a democratic form of government. CMV</title>

    <original_post>I think all governments should be based on individual liberty and democracy. And statism, monarchy, autocracy, and dictatorships are ALWAYS bad.

I'm not going to elaborate on exactly why I think so, at least not here, I just want you to argue why I'm wrong.</original_post>

    <text>Are you talking about pure democracy? Not even America is a pure democracy. That would be too chaotic. 

Democratic republics are where it's at. The people, as a group, are too easily swayed and manipulated, and they are not experts on all the issues that must be voted on. With a democratic republic, we can elect people who represent their constituents and their values, and have their best interests in mind, and it is their job to be educated on the issues. So while I might not have the time in the day to learn about every piece of legislation that needs to be voted on, my representative does, and he can vote for it on my behalf. </text>
