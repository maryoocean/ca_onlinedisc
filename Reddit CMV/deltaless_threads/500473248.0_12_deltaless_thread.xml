    <title>CMV: There is no such thing as "love at first sight"</title>

    <original_post>So-called love at first sight is based on just that - sight. 
&amp;amp;nbsp;

Now I know some people are going to jump in with anecdotes about grandparents who married after three dates and were together for 70 years and whatnot. But that is a form of commitment and usually (in older people) a response to a society that did not really allow for divorce. Can two people make it work if they fall in love based on sight and quickly marry? Sure, sometimes. But that doesn't mean that real love, deep love like you have when you know all parts of a person can form immediately upon seeing them. You can't truly love someone without knowing about their personality, their thoughts and their feelings.</original_post>

    <text>Love at first sight is an *idiomatic* expression, which means that it shouldn't be taken literally. It's something we say in hindsight, to express that there was an immediate attraction between two people from the start, which later developed into real/deep love.

In general, the word love is a pretty flexible concept with a huge range of meanings. Nearly every Christian will tell you that they love you. It doesn't even mean that they are attracted or infatuated with you.</text>
