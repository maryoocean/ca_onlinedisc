    <title>CMV: women are not going for the 'upper tier' of men</title>
    <original_poster>BadgerSame6600</original_poster>
    <original_post>I see this rhetoric over and over and over online, and hear it IRL sometimes.  It drives me crazy tbh. I am a man out in the world, living life, 35 years of it now. I have friends who are all over the spectrum of physical attractiveness. Some are single, most aren't. Their gfs/wifes are also across the spectrum. In most couples I know, friends and acquaintances,  the woman is better looking, earns more, or has more social skills ect. 

Now I know this is my experience, so it is anecdotal, but at the same time I just don't buy this whole women are too choosy. My opinion is that the dudes who say this are refusing to address their flaws and accept them. If these men believe this and they go out into the world feeling hard done by, fighting a losing battle, then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Most people can smell that level of victimhood a mile of. 

OK, open to have this challenge, so- change my view, Redditors! </original_post>

I think there are a lot of men (and women) out there who have flaws, but rather acknowledging those flaws and working on self improvement they give up and/or blame external factors.

I think its important to be honest with yourself about your flaws and i think everyone should always be on a journey of self improvement.  That journey of self improvement will lead to a successful life including a successful romantic life.

If women were not choosy, then this would not be needed.  If I'm a jerk and a slob and i have nothing to offer, then i need to get my act together because women are choosy and will not choose me.  

(I think this applies in reverse as well, men are also choosy, but that's not the topic of the post)</text>
