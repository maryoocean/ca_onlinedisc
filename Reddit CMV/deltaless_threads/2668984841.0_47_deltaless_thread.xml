    <title>CMV: women are not going for the 'upper tier' of men</title>
    <original_poster>BadgerSame6600</original_poster>
    <original_post>I see this rhetoric over and over and over online, and hear it IRL sometimes.  It drives me crazy tbh. I am a man out in the world, living life, 35 years of it now. I have friends who are all over the spectrum of physical attractiveness. Some are single, most aren't. Their gfs/wifes are also across the spectrum. In most couples I know, friends and acquaintances,  the woman is better looking, earns more, or has more social skills ect. 

Now I know this is my experience, so it is anecdotal, but at the same time I just don't buy this whole women are too choosy. My opinion is that the dudes who say this are refusing to address their flaws and accept them. If these men believe this and they go out into the world feeling hard done by, fighting a losing battle, then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Most people can smell that level of victimhood a mile of. 

OK, open to have this challenge, so- change my view, Redditors! </original_post>

    <text>Yeah, I don't know, but on a dating app you can choose someone you find attractive. In my experience, women are quite picky and how can you blame them when most guys they swiped just resulted in a match? It's easier to choose more attractive guys, since you can't keep up with the amounts of matches. If I find 300 matches in 7 km, you bet I will select the best 5-30.

I know a lot of guys who just swipe every woman to the right, just to hope to get a match. They were generally not interested who this woman might be at all. (Note: a lot of men are nice and do no such things)

Women might be less picky if men were a little bit more picky as well. If a woman would not get hundreds of matches, then there would be less incentive to select "top-tier" men.</text>
