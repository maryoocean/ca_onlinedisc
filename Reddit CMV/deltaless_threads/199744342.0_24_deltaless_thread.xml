    <title>CMV: Giving other cultures sh*t about eating dog meat is hypocritical</title>
    <original_poster>simobk</original_poster>
    <original_post>Hi all,

So someone just posted a video on my FB feed about [the Yulin dog meat festival](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=yulin+dog+meat+festival). It is horrifying...

For the purpose of this CMV, let's forget about how it's done (the way they get the dogs, they treat them... etc.) and concentrate **only** on the dog meat eating part.

I love dogs, and yes, I find it horrifying that other cultures eat them. However, I also understand that for other cultures, it is horrifying to see us eat beef or pork.

In my opinion, the only situation where you are allowed to complain is if you are talking about eating animal meat in general. But if you enjoy eating a good steak, then it is hypocritical to criticize others for eating what they consider is "just meat".

Again, I am stressing the fact that this is not about the *animal cruelty* part. It's just about the meat eating. For the sake of this CMV, let's suppose that the animals are bred and slaughtered in the most humane possible way.

So... CMV

    <text>&amp;gt;I am stressing the fact that this is not about the animal cruelty part. It's just about the meat eating.

This framing is inherently flawed. If we are to disregard anything related to cruelty, then your premise is excluding the overwhelming majority of the reasons why people actually condemn the practice. How *would* anyone disagree with it, if that wasn't a factor? There are more tangential things like environmental or human-centric considerations, but that's clearly not what you're focusing on. You're essentially stating that you feel these condemnations are hypocritical or unprincipled, but your framing excludes from consideration any views that are aren't.

So this CMV is self-undermining and impossible to answer on the intended issue, except by disregarding your criteria, as a number of commenters have done very well. I'd contend you fundamentally misunderstand the nature of people's objections when you assume that animal welfare issues can somehow be "factored out".</text>

    <text>Agree with /u/trifunctor.  A lot of what is in the popular press is about how inhumanely the dogs are treated.  They are literally boiled alive or dragged throughout the street, the thought being that if they have fear and adrenaline running through their body they will be more tasty.  We don't do that for cows, pigs, chickens or any other domestic meat source.  By excluding that single factor you're missing the main thrust of the issue.</text>
