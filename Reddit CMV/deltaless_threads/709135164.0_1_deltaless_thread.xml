    <title>CMV: News Reporting must strictly be as neutral and factual as possible, instead of containing the reporter’s opinions and agenda.</title>
    <original_poster>Daberinos</original_poster>
    <original_post>Sometimes, when I watch or read a news report, I find that I notice many, or at least noticeable parts of the articles are not strictly of the information of the news report, but of the reporter’s opinions of the article. This leads to the reporter changing the meaning of, warping, omitting or highlighting certain parts of a report due to either subconscious opinion or conscious agenda pushing. Hence, many times have I read a news article and realise that I have been influenced by the way the reporter phrases the facts of the situation, and even outright puts their own opinion in the article. When a person who does not consciously make sure to watch out for subliminal messaging in news reports read them, their world views can seriously be affected. A good example is the “CNN vs Fox” meme where people poke fun at the fact CNN panders to democratic audiences and Fox panders to Republican audiences, and their reports of the same incident can be wildly different, and that’s where the opinions of the writer starts to show. Obviously I don’t believe that a report can be entirely without a second-hand opinion, in fact I think it’s impossible to produce a perfectly neutral news report. However I do believe that the situation right now could be remedied into a far better state than it is now. By having a opinion-wise neutral news report, it gives the reader a chance to developed their own opinions on the subject, and if the writer would want to give their view on the topic which I agree with, it should be segregated from the facts of the news report to warn news readers that what they read will be a third-person view of the report. Thus News reports and proper discussion of opinions can be properly distinguished. 

However, some people have told me that they disagree with what I said, thus I would like to know the general consensus of how people view this view.</original_post>

    <text>Editorial decisions have to be made about every story. Even the decision to report on a certain event is an editorial decision - there are a thousand other things that happened that day that might be just as newsworthy. Different outlets make different decisions about what information is the most important and relevant. They also have to make decisions about what level of verification or lack thereof is acceptable for what kind of information. So different outlets ending up with very different takes on the same story is not necessarily indicative of political bias, oftentimes, it's indicative of different editorial decisions.</text>

    <text>I understand that editorial decisions exist and agree that that is completely fine, but there are some articles where I’m done reading them and forget about it before coming across another article reporting the same thing but by a different reporter, and find extremely important information that completely changes the way I view the situation, or where the same piece of information are being represented in to radically different forms that can completely divide opinions on the interpretation of the report.</text>

    <text>Yes but it could be that the first reporter didn't have access to that information, either because of time constraints or because an editorial decision was made that that information couldn't be verified to an acceptable level. Later reports have the luxury of taking more time to gather and verify information. Some reports have access to sources that others don't. The BBC and Buzzfeed are always going to have a different take because they have different journalistic standards and sources.</text>

    <text>I was referring more to purposeful change of meaning of a sentence or omission of information ( which is much rarer) but yes I do understand that later reports will contain more information that earlier reports. 

Also, your mention of Buzzfeed and BBC reminds me of a very interesting discussion of Journalistic culture.</text>
