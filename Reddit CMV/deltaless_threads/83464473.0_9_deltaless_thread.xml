    <original_post>Prayer as an act of reaching to a deity for help or comfort has no appreciable effect beyond what can be achieved by normal positive thinking.

Praying to end world hunger or to get a job has no effect unless you or someone else makes the decision to achieve the goal. These goals could also just as easily be achieved without prayer.

Edit: I do not believe in the non corporeal nature of prayer. I do believe in the effects such as positive thinking giving someone a better understanding of who they are a what they can do.</original_post>

    <text>I think the reason that people find prayer to be so effective is because nobody is perfect. You could be the most skilled at anything in the world and still be beaten by someone with less skill than you. Human error exists and therefore we can't help but doubt ourselves. 
Prayer relies on the crux that there is something out there with complete control of the world. They can manipulate people, nature, time and space. Instead of having to rely on your own imperfect skills, reactions, and judgement there is that which can help you if you're asking for it. I am atheist but I have always viewed prayer as such. Positive thinking still relies on one's self, and deep down there is still uncertainty. </text>
