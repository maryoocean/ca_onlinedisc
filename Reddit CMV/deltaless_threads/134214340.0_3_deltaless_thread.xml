    <title>CMV: I Believe a Sustainable Market for Video Games Oriented Towards Women Exists, and that Feminism Would Be Better Served to Develop For It Than Merely Complain About It</title>
    <original_poster>OhCrapADinosaur</original_poster>
    <original_post>E3 took place the past couple of days, and of the various bits of news from the event, Ubisoft announced their Assassin's Creed title. I'm wholly indifferent to the Assassin's Creed games, but apparently this game features 4 person local multiplayer and only includes a slate of male characters. As a result of this news, some of my feminist former-friends posted articles to this effect: http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/11/5799386/no-female-characters-in-assassins-creed-unity-too-much-work

I'm not going to weigh in on the truth of Ubisoft's claims particularly, whether or not their claims were justified, or whether any of the views held by either side is right and just. The general consensus among the feminism crowd seemed to be along the lines that:

* 1. There are many sexist stereotypes prevalent in video games, possibly moreso in mainstream titles, and particularly noticed (by the feminists) are those stereotypes concerning women.
* 2. There is a large and substantial base of female gamers, many of whom would presumably enjoy games that break stereotypes and employ strong female lead characters
* 3. Many popular games today don't necessarily serve female gamers so well

I'm not going to suggest that feminists shouldn't complain (well, I might a little), but from my vantage point that's pretty much all I see get done. If you actually believe 1, 2, and 3 above, then there might be a GOLDEN MARKET OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU and you should invest your ranting energy into developing for this female gamer market (it's also overwhelmingly likely that this is, in fact, already being done and I'm just not particularly aware of it). Barriers to entry have probably never been lower to go develop for almost any platform you like, and indy games that hit it big have the opportunity to hit it REALLY big. You could make the video game equivalent of "Orange is the New Black" and have millions of loving, adoring fans who will cheer and talk about how you helped bring women into the video game mainstream. And hey, money!

Sadly, this attitude didn't much win over my feminist friends, who more or less told me to shut up and go fuck myself. So... yeah, I fail to see the problem with my thinking. Anybody want to help me out?

    <text>I don't think there's any such golden market opportunity, because for the market, "good female character" isn't a dealbreaker. People look for things like good performance on their hardware, good mechanics, good gameplay, etc. Those are the dealbreakers. If it runs at 10 fps, it's unplayable. If it crashes every 10 minutes, it's unplayable. If controls are off to the point you're fighting the control system, it sucks. Those are reasons why games don't get bought.

But female characters? I doubt it. Take for instance Half Life for something well known, liked with an iconic protagonist. How many people do you think looked at the box, read the great reviews, but then decided that they wouldn't buy it because the one in the suit wasn't a woman?

So the situation I think exists is that there's a whole lot of people who'd consider a good female character the icing on the cake on a good game, but I doubt that there are that many for whom it's a strict requirement and wouldn't buy it otherwise. I also highly doubt that many people would buy a bad game just because the character is female. So really, anybody planning to sell to this market has to create a good game first of all. Then crunch time comes, critical issues need fixing, extra character models get cut, and it still sells great.

That leaves the issue of what gender is the first protagonist you make. Well, the problem there is that programming is highly male dominated, investors are highly paranoid, creating games is risky and expensive, and the vast majority doesn't go into this field to push their ideological concerns. </text>
