    <title>CMV: Focusing on ideological purity does not win elections</title>
    <original_poster>LaserWerewolf</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have encountered many people who openly say that they hate centrists more than they hate their actual political opponents. Fair enough, because ideologically they often have more in common with their opponents than with a genuine centrist, but when the election comes around the same people often ask why more centrists don't vote for their candidates. I don't know about you, but I think voting for people who hate me seems like a questionable idea. 

I have also noticed that in certain echo chambers (possibly this is a general feature of echo chambers) people are often insulted, verbally abused, or even excluded if they do not share every single belief common to the people in that echo chamber. Often this person then leaves and joins a different echo chamber where they are more welcome. 

Let's say that a person starts out in a Party A echo chamber. They agree with 9 out of 10 of the main Party A viewpoints. But because they disagree with Party A one one single viewpoint, they are pushed out of the echo chamber by people who demand ideological purity.

Now let's imagine that Party B says, "It is enough for us that you agree with us about this one viewpoint. We accept you." The person now joins a Party B echo chamber.

I think this person would most likely start agreeing with Party B more and with Party A less after switching to the Party B echo chamber. I also think this person would be less likely to vote for a Party A candidate and more likely to vote for a Party B candidate after switching to a Party B echo chamber. 

To change my view, you would have to persuade me that focusing on ideological purity causes a greater number of people to vote for one's party. Bonus points if you can back this up with some kind of statistical data, but a purely logical argument could also be convincing.

    <text>There are many problems with centrist way of thinking though - and it boils down to context. Context which centrists, as your example brought up, continue to ignore no matter how much reality itself slaps them in the face.

First, purely and simply, the popular argument online: ‘both sides are the same!’

No. No, to anyone with a brain who isn’t being willfully ignorant, malicious, spiteful, or just plain incompetent, they aren’t the same. Does that make democrats a pure and godlike entity? Absolutely not.

But at the end of the day, the issue becomes this: when you hurl bullets ‘at both sides’ using logic built upon nothing more than ignorance of reality, you’re not just ignoring how wrong your argument becomes, you become an unwitting participant in that which centrists claim they hate the most.

Which begs the question: are centrists closet republicans who just don’t want people to know they’re republicans, despite not fooling many people?

Or are they just damn incompetent 

Look, it’s not up to me to tell anyone else how to vote - but it’s worth pointing out that despite centrists constant screeching, their ideology, their rhetoric, their mindset, and their vote still keeps ending up in the hands of those who abuse their station among several other things.

These are also the laughable idiots whose unwillingness to bend on anything south of their imagined purity that we were handed Donald Trump - so the same blood that’s on his hands is ultimately also on theirs’.</text>
