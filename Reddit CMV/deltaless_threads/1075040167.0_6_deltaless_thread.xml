    <original_post>[EDIT- PRAISED NOT APPRAISED] Overweight people shouldn’t be told complements about their weights it’s unhealthy and is making their lifespan shorter, I understand there are some people that can’t help their weight due to conditions but there are some people who don’t try to help themselves but are getting complements, more weight puts for pressure on joints causing conditions like arthritis as well as heart conditions, blood conditions and kidney issues, we shouldn’t be lying to people saying that their body is incredible, they can still be pretty believe me there are many over weight people that look nice but what doesn’t look nice is them being winded after walking up a flight of stairs. Don’t discriminate them but stop complements over unhealthy habits.</original_post>

    <text>I think you’re referring to a very rare phenomenon...I don’t think many peoples actively praise the unhealthy components of others lifestyles. At most people will brush of concerns- a fat person takes a doughnut, smiles guiltily and you say “ah don’t worry it’s good for the soul”. 

I think most of this behaviour is more akin to not making someone feel bad for their human foibles, which we all have, just some of us are lucky enough to not wear them on our sleeves. 

Ultimately, positive behaviour change usually happens when someone feels good about themselves so we should promote that.</text>
