    <title>CMV: if you live in a “traditionally Christian” nation you should use Merry Christmas as the default greeting/goodbye unless you’re asked not to.</title>

    <original_post>Basically I think of it similar to misgendering people. In that context use the pronouns of the gender they appear to present as (unless you already know the person’s wishes). If and when someone asks you to use an alternate set, you apologise and change going forward. 

The same should be done with Christmas- in my experience almost nobody has any genuine objection to being told merry Christmas, hell, I was discussing just today with a woman in a full hijab our favourite (largely secular) aspects of Christmas, all the while referring to things as “Christmas XYZ”. However if someone tells me they’d prefer happy holidays then I’ll just switch. Just like pronouns it literally makes no difference to me. 

You can change my view by showing me that knowingly using words that will make someone else feel less welcome or upset is not worth it compared to the potential loss I might feel at using a different term. Of course maybe you can come up with other arguments I’ve not thought of.

Edit: this only applies “at this time of year” say more or less the month of December.</original_post>

    <text>This seems to express a profound misunderstanding of the nature of freedom.

You may be unaware that the Puritans who settled part of new England, the "Pilgrims", banned any observance of Christmas as being rooted in pagan tradition and having nothing to do with the birth of Jesus. You could be punished for wishing anyone a Merry Christmas. It is a misunderstanding to suggest that they left England to find religious freedom. Religious persecution had been significantly relaxed by the time they boarded the Mayflower and they had been free to worship as they saw fit in the old country. The reason they came to the new world was to establish a religiously hidebound society where they could impose their strict fundamentalism on others. 

If we're going to demand everyone observe Christian rituals the question is, which ones?

And while the rest of us might be amused watching all the Christian sects fight it out among themselves in a cage-match, that's kind of the description of the way it had worked for 800 years in the old county. The separation of church and state is a direct response to the fact that giving religion **any** meaningful control over public behavior, or the government any recourse to religious authority for itself, is a proven recipe for disaster.

If someone wishes you well with a polite greeting, why do you feel moved to criticize their language? 

Here in America, we are free to wish anyone the best of any season in any language we choose and you are entirely free to wish anyone a Merry Christmas in return.</text>
