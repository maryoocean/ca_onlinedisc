    <title>CMV: There is no reason to refuse to sign a pre-nup unless your reasons for marriage are corrupt to begin with.</title>

    <original_post>I know that a lot of people view pre-nups as “insurance” in the case of divorce. And I get it. If someone is entering into a marriage with a LOT of capital, and the other person comes from significantly less, it makes sense to want to make sure that what’s yours, stays yours. 

But I think a lot of people (at least in media portrayals and stories from friends) are very against the idea of signing one and I don’t get it. If you love someone and you intend to be married to them forever, a pre-nup is essentially pointless. To me, it only seems like you would refuse to/be adverse to sign a pre-nup if you’re marrying someone because you see the relationship as potentially beneficial for you in the case of a divorce. 

I’m interested in hearing anyone’s opinion, but particularly the opinions of those who have been in this situation, i.e. the one asking for the pre-nup or the one being asked. Thank you!!

EDIT: I’ve awarded 3 deltas on this post so far because of some very valid points. The most convincing of which was that a prenup compels the person signing to be in a potentially extremely difficult and even dangerous position in the case of abuse. Someone else provided me with a very convincing analogy which put the whole issue in a new light for me. A third person suggested the possibility of an unfair prenup; I understand why you would not sign one, however, after re-negotiating the terms to a place where both parties can be satisfied with the prenup, it would then make no sense to continue to refuse to sign. And if the person asking for a prenup refuses to compromise on unfair terms, you probably shouldn’t be marrying them in the first place, imho. 

Ultimately, my personal experience has shaped my view so that I have no issue with signing a prenup with my partner, but I do see now that the issue is much more multi-faceted than I had previously believed. I suppose my view on the subject now is: there is no reason not to sign a prenup if the terms are satisfactory to both parties and there is room for a discussion between the couple. If your SO refuses to compromise on any point or even engage in a discussion about the terms, you probably shouldn’t be marrying them in the first place as they clear don’t see you as an equal. 

So I guess...view shifted/expanded, but not altogether changed. </original_post>
