    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>The thing that brought it home for me was a fellow I know, now in his 70's,  Jewish by religion &amp; nationality, America born, who has no family on his mother's side. She was the only one in her family to survive. He would talk about how strange the holiday gatherings were with only his dad's side present. No aunts or uncles or cousins or grandparents from mom's side how unbalanced it seemed &amp; how it was so difficult for him to understand when he was little. Yeah. Those conversations brought it home.</text>
