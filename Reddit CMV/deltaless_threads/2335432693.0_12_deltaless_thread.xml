    <title>CMV: all (US) roads that are not highways between cities or states should only have a single, one-way, lane of civilian traffic or less.</title>
    <original_poster>Square-Dragonfruit76</original_poster>
    <original_post>The main reasoning for my argument is because there at this point has been consistent, replicated, research finding that the more roads you add, the more traffic is actually _increased._ It would be a rough transition at first, but in theory, traffic would be diminished if you cut down the number of roads and the number of lanes. This would be great for the environment but it also would be great for everyone driving because there would be less traffic. The lanes that are no longer in use could be used to improve our society in a number of ways. They could be made into trees or park area. They could be restricted to only delivery vehicles and/or public transit or emergency vehicles. Or they could be made into bike paths. And if all goes well, perhaps people would even be open to eliminating some roads for civilian traffic all together.

Edit: Again, to reiterate, according to all the current research, more roads actually _create_ more traffic. So if anything, this would reduce traffic, maybe not immediately, but over time. A lot of people seem to not have read that part, so I'm not going to respond to repeats of people who clearly did not read my argument.

What you're saying makes no sense. You are misinterpreting this research.

Imagine if what you're saying is true, and that eliminating driving lanes made cars travel faster. If that's the case, then why would anyone stop driving? After all, driving would be even better than before! So if anything more people would want to drive on these smaller roads. But you can see that this is ridiculous.

What "induced demand" actually means is something much more common sense: that if you make something better, people will use it more. If you add capacity to roads, thereby decreasing travel times, more people will use the roads, *but not so many as to make travel times worse than before*.</text>
