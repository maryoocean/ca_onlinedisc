    <title>CMV: It is not necessary to prove that gays are "born this way" in order to advance gay rights.</title>
    <original_poster>poolerboy0077</original_poster>
    <original_post>Perhaps in response to people who claim that being gay is a "lifestyle choice," there has been a push by gays and gay allies to prove that gay people are born this way. Even Lady Gaga decided to make it an anthem for the LGBT community. Many people make this assertion in the context of gay rights, including many well-educated and smart people like Judge Richard Poser did in his concurrence for the latest federal appeals Title VII discrimination case. I hold the position that, while it may be true, this is unnecessary in the context of advancing gay rights. Insisting as much, in my opinion, is a kind of naturalistic fallacy. You are welcome to change my view.

**EDIT:** Thanks everyone for posting. You are free to continue to post here and I'll hopefully get around to them if time permits, but I have to go to bed. To sum up what's occurred below, I remain unconvinced by the arguments presented. I was hopeful that there would be some kind of rationale or perspective I hadn't yet come across but a lot of these arguments I've already encountered (for several years now), and needless to say I don't find them to be very persuasive. :( I'm hopeful someone will come to this thread with something I haven't yet thought of before.

It may not be necessary but it's far more effective than just waiting for people to legalize what they think is a "choice".  American law is very concerned with natural and God-given and universal rights.  By linking homosexuality to such a thing, it's very difficult to argue against it.  It may not have been accepted in the past but I'm going to assume you think we need to get sweeping rights for people at once or any attempt is worthless.  The fight for this, though legal now, could take a few more decades to normalize.

Civil Rights occurred in the 60s, but we're still seeing a lot of racism today.</text>

That's a false choice; those aren't the only two options. My view is that responding to other people's non sequitur assertions by answering their questions head on essentially gives them what they want -- validation to their irrelevant claims. My position is to instead assume their premise purely for the sake of argument and require them to show how their premises lead to their conclusions. It's a way of correctly shifting the burden of proof back on them.</text>
