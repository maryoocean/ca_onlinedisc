    <title>CMV: There is no good reason to leave a note on a comment after editing it for typos</title>
    <original_poster>wscuraiii</original_poster>
    <original_post>Is this some aspect of internet etiquette I missed out on at internet school? 

Too often, I'll be scrolling through comments on Reddit, and come across one with a footnote that reads:

EDIT: typos

Or even worse:

EDIT: a word

I understand and support leaving edit notes for developing stories or when *content* needs to be corrected after the fact. That makes sense.  But spelling? Seriously? When you turn in an essay or publish an article you wouldn't leave a footnote saying:

[1] All spelling errors have been corrected.

Who cares if you proofread your work? Why is that so special it deserves a footnote? Correct your typos and move on. You're *supposed* to proofread your work. It's assumed we all try to do so. Everyone makes typos, especially today when so many people are typing on mobile devices. I wrote this entire post using swipe text, for example. I'll be absolutely stunned if I don't find a few awkward typos in here. But I certainly won't let everybody know I corrected them. Because assuming I found them, of course I did. 

That's my view. Am I just uneducated? Is there something I missed? I've been meaning to make this post for a while now but kept forgetting, until I saw the "I fixed my typos" edit in three different comments today. I'm just trying to understand what the thought process could possibly be. 

EDIT: Did not find any typos, so none were corrected. Stunned.

EDIT 2, ELECTRIC BOOGALOO: Thanks for the silver, anonymous stranger!</original_post>

    <text>When someone edits their comment, an automated stamp or tag will appear that the comment has been edited. However, the reader will not know what was edited. Therefore, the writer should document what was edited. The reason for the edit could be material/relevant or it may be trivial. In any event, we don't know either situation unless the purpose of the edit is documented that gave rise to the automated Edited stamp or tag. To date, there is no "audit trail" available for edited comments. Until an automated audit trail becomes available, best Reddit/Facebook/YouTube/blog practice is to leave your own "audit trail" by briefly indicating what the edits were for. If there were no automated "Edited" stamp or tag provided to a post that was edited for material/relevant information, a reader may not become aware of it, which may affect a reply or their views.</text>
