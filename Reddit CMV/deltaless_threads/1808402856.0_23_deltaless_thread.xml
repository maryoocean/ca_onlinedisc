    <title>CMV: Fredom of speech is far more important than a few people being offended</title>

    <original_post>Freedom of speech should be protected and kept, there shouldn't be people arrested for anti trans comments or insulting a soldier/soldiers, or for nazi jokes, or racist remarks or jokes.

Those should all be handled between people, if someone says stuff you dont like you handle it, simply block them or avoid them, theres a whole world you can be in and that persons in a very tiny part of it. 

It makes me nervous seeing people arrested and charged for saying things. It's only leading us to a place where we can be arrested for saying whatever the government doesnt like. And they shouldn't be in that much power to effect our communication with eachother. 

I live in scotland and dont feel I have freedom of speech anymore. 

(For the record I'm a white woman who's bi and have trans thoughts ig for those folks who say it never has been about me, it has sometimes, and in more ways than just those)

Edit: No it's not just anti trans people, Yes I believe crimes other than hate crimes involving speech should be illegal (threatening violence, doxing, defamation) but I also believe insults, jokes and bad takes or thoughts should not be.

Edit 2: Consequences for what is said like losing a job, getting insulted, losing friends ect is totally fine I just dont think the Government should be in charge of what can get you arrested in this sence.

Edit 3: I live in SCOTLAND in the UNITED KINGDOM or in BRITAIN depending what you say, I'm not american, im also not here advocating for my right to be a dick, im just saying the government arent the ones I want saying what I cant say, I mean twitter can destroy lives without them anyway.</original_post>

    <text>You can't have freedom of speech without some restrictions on speech. 


Absolute freedom of speech will restrict it for more people than having a few small ways in which you are restricted. 

How about people calling for violence, should that be allowed?

Or what do you think about let's say Louisiana (picking at random, not using data) and 85% of the population is as racist as they come (again, using it as hypothetical) and 10% of the population is black. Should that 85% I'd the population be allowed to be openly racist towards that population. Even more so, should local businesses owners be allowed to not serve those black people because they're a racist asshole?</text>
