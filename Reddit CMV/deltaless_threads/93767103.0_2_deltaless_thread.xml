    <title>I believe humans need their rights limited to ensure survival of our species. CMV.</title>

    <original_post>This is something I've believed for a while. As a species, humans are self-destructive. We procreate too much and consume too many resources. I believe that something like China's one-child policy should be instituted in as many countries as possible to curb population growth. ~~I think currency should be done away with and governments should provide housing and necessities while the population works for the betterment and survival of humanity as a whole rather than for monetary compensation.~~

Am I crazy to think this is how the world should be? 

EDIT: Perhaps eliminating currency would be more problematic than keeping it.</original_post>

    <text>Depends on who you ask lol. Basically what youre describing sounds like a socialist utopia. Thats pretty much the whole basis of socialism: to each according to his need, from each according to his ability. It doesn't work because we ARE human and will do greedy, selfish things. Its what Russia was shooting for but got lost along the way in the midst of corruption of greedy officials. You can't give anyone that kind of power. It will be abused. Even america, land of democracy and checks and balances, has managed to allow greedy and corruption to influence politics and completely abuse the whole system.</text>

    <text>So basically, any system we adopt is doomed to fail anyway? </text>

    <text>No, but leadership attracts a certain kind of self-interested person, and drives away the pragmatic individuals who make good leaders.

For a decent leader the general mundanity of people looking to you for guidance is a never-ending irritation. For a poor leader it's a narcissistic reason for existence.</text>

    <text>A problem I can see with an "everything provided for you" state, is that what incentive is there for advancement, to the individual.

Why should I become a doctor and help people, if I'm going to live in the same house with the same food as the man who sweeps the streets. 

I think something like this could only be implemented when humanity has advanced to a point that the vast majority of tasks, eg cleaning, health care, maintenance, are automated, and the systems which maintain these are them selves automated. Humanity would no longer have much to do, and could get on with sitting around and watching TV, probably leading to something much like the simpletons found in HG Wells "The time machine".</text>
