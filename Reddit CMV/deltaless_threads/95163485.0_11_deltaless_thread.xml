    <original_post>1. Although some disabilities aren't hereditary, almost all disabilities and mental issues come from genetics and genetic issues. 

2. I only believe this for people who'd be a complete drain on society. Yes, there are exceptions like Stephen Hawking and what not, but that's exactly what they are. Exceptions. I believe there should be no debate over those who're mentally insane as well. 

3. I believe the government should force this because the parents wouldn't know right from wrong while being distraught by emotions. Ultimately, it would benefit the parents much more to abort the disabled child. Have you seen how much of a life-ruiner those disabled kids are? 

4. They also cause anxiety in the parents because of the thoughts of what will happen after they're not around. 

5. It may seem inhumane now, but keep in mind that I'm talking about abortion here. The disabled currently alive can live their lives and what not, I'm talking about those that aren't born yet. Right when the doctors find out that the kid will turn out fucked up, they should do something about it.

6. Okay, okay. So you're morally higher than me. I'm a monster for thinking this way. **Can you honestly look me in the eyes and tell me that the lives of those parents of fucked up kids wouldn't be much, much better without all that bullshit? How many parents are having their money and time drained because of this stuff?** </original_post>

    <text>First of all, where do you intend to draw the line on determining who is and isn't a "complete drain on society"? How exactly do you define "complete drain on society"? By how dependent they are on someone to care for themselves day-to-day? Or by monetary cost perhaps? HIV drugs are some of the most expensive drugs in existence, but they enable HIV+ people to lead relatively normal lives. Organ transplants are insanely expensive procedures, too. Could you really take sole responsibility for deciding that the mentally challenged nobody with Down Syndrome and the mental age of a 13 year old should live while Stephen Hawking should die? 

Don't get me wrong; I'm high-functioning autistic and transgender myself, and my life has been pretty fucking hard because of it. If my mother had known all the conditions I would grow up to have before I was born and had decided then that it was better to abort me instead, I can't say I would've wholly blamed her for it. It would've been her choice to make, and I support the right of women to choose for themselves what's best for them and their families. But despite the challenges I faced as a child (some of which I still face now), I also grew up to be a wholly self-sufficient and relatively successful software engineer with an IQ of over 140.

I personally just don't feel it should be anyone else's right but my mother's to decide whether it was "right" or "wrong" that I was permitted to be born. In this way, I am pro-choice, but this does not mean that I feel it's always okay and "right" to just abort a pregnancy for any old reason.</text>
