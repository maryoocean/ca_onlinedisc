    <title>CMV: Kink and BDSM should not be at public pride events and should be kept for 18+ ones</title>
    <original_poster>akoudagawaismywaifu</original_poster>
    <original_post>To start, I am a lesbian. And I've been seeing recent controversy about this topic. 

Look, no denying that kink plays a big role in the creation of pride. It is a part of embracing sexuality and shouldn't be excluded from the community. 

However, it should not be at public pride parades. Pride should be for everyone of all ages. Many people say "stop catering to the straight capitalized ideal of what pride should be" and "pride isn't a party, it's a protest don't police us" and "children should go to disney if they want family friendly" This has nothing to do with straight rainbow capitalism. I figured out I was LGBT at age 11 and trust me if I saw a kink act in public I would be kind of disgusted. I'm still a minor now, and I'd be less disgusted but still. I know people say that it's up to you to bring your children to pride, but by making all pride events "wear whatever you want even if it's nothing" we are also kinda excluding minors from it. It's also non consensual to anyone who is exposed to such acts, because nobody wants to go to pride to see naked people right? The "think of the children" phrase holds true here. Young children and teens embracing their sexuality shouldn't be forced to see adult acts against their will. 

Again, no denying the role kink plays in the community, but it should be kept at 18+ events. There should definitely be a separate pride for people who just want to do leather and other kinks. That way, you can do whatever you want in a safe space where you know you won't offend others, and because people consented to come to an 18+ event, it's all good. 

That's just my personal opinion on it, but it seems to be the minority. I'd like to see how you guys think about this.

Edit: it appears after reading and responding to several comments, I don't really have a problem with kink, but more with public indecency. I don't care if you wear a collar or leather pants. But I'd rather not see things that could get you arrested or questioned for doing in public.</original_post>

    <text>1. What do you constitute to be for 18+? I definitely knew and saw a lot of porn by the age of 13. 

2. If you took your 10 year old to a gay pride parade and they saw kink fetishes do you think that would impact them negatively, how so?</text>

    <text>1. As a comment said above, something you could get arrested for in public or at least be questioned for indecency I don't care if you wear a collar or leather boots. 

2. I know that if I saw someone walking their naked partner on a leash (or anything similar) at the age of 11, I'd probably be like "ew wtf" and think it's strange. That might just be me though</text>

    <text>You’re definitely allowed to say think “ew wtf” and think it’s strange, but that doesn’t mean they’re not allowed to do it. Part of the point of Pride is being out and loud about stuff that makes people uncomfortable, because it’s that perception that’s part of the problem. 

If LGBTQ+ people were only allowed to be/wear/do what mainstream society found tasteful or normal, everybody would have to go back in the closet. 

That applies to the “getting arrested” part too; laws are tied to social attitudes about stuff, not necessarily what’s right or wrong. When you catch yourself thinking “ew wtf” try to examine WHY you feel that way and decide if it’s reasonable or if it’s just societal pressures talking. That’s how things change.</text>

    <text>Wish I could delta you--I've been arguing on 'nipples are legal to be exposed here, leather collars are legal to be worn here, why are we trying to exclude legal things during June because they're associated with queerness?'--but that entire argument is ALSO weak because laws themselves are tied to social attitudes which have excluded LGBT+ for far too long.

I won't say that my argument has been a bad take to bring up, but I needed this reminder pretty badly.</text>

This covers that, though. Pedophilia isn't just illegal because of societal pressures.</text>

In the same way that a homophobe might look at two gay men kissing and be like "ew wtf"?

You should ask yourself why you feel icked. What is so wrong about seeing a sexual act between two consenting adults? Is there something fundamentally wrong about what they are doing? 

All this pearl clutching over "What about the kids?" is rooted in the very sexual conservatism that pride seeks to challenge. In most Western countries, nobody would bat an eyelid at a couple kissing in public, when in countries like India, that would be just as outrageous as the example you give. 

They are all just arbitrary social norms. Where is the evidence to say that exposure to naked people engaging in consensual sexual acts impacts children negatively? It's bullshit propaganda used by socially conservative people to retain social control, in the same way as social conservatives in India make little things like wearing a short skirt or kissing in public an issue of morality. 

I am not accusing you of being one of these people. More so pointing out how all of us implicitly accept so many arbitrary social norms just because we have grown up with them.</text>

    <text>lmao there is nothing wrong with what they’re doing. There is everything wrong with *where* they do it. A heterosexual couple walking around with one on a leash, barely clothed, with a dildo inside them would get flak too. 

This isn’t a hurr durr the gheys have to dress like the strayts. 

Children cannot consent</text>

    <text>I agree and I'm not sure why nobody else seems to have an issue with this example. Let's take the kids out of the equation even: 

Performing a legitimate sex act in public involves other people, who did not consent. Say my kink is voyerism-should I be allowed to masturbate on a subway? Or have sex with a consenting adult on a busy sidewalk? 

Of course not. Seeing consenting adults do sex acts may not be harmful, but seeing such things in public, unexpectedly, and against your will ABSOLUTELY can be. This isn't about "ew gay people can't have kinks" this is about *openly involving others in those kinks without asking*. 

Before you all downvote me, genuinely ask yourself what you would do if you saw this kind if think outside of pride. Switch the gender roles: is it okay for 2 men? 2 women? A hetero couple? Can they do this at an airport? A Jimmy John's? What boundaries do you beleive in?</text>

    <text>I don't like seeing public sex, but that's a dangerous argument. If performing a sex act in public violates your consent, how doesn't kissing in public violate your consent too? Should it be illegal?</text>

    <text>I don't equate kissing to sex at all. I think those are inherently different, and platonic relationships can involve kissing. There is no inherent sexual aspect to it.

I don't think heavily sexual kissing should be public. So I guess my answer is-it depends? Are they lightly kissing each other on the lips, or full-on making out on the ground and grinding on each other?</text>

    <text>&amp;gt; I don't think heavily sexual kissing should be public.

Precisely that is why that argument is so dangerous. Kissing in public doesn't harm you in any way. You just want to restrict other people's freedom because it bothers you. That's why gay people weren't allowed to display affection at all. You can't just ban things because you find them disgusting.</text>

    <text>So, out of curiosity, where do you draw the line? And why? To what extent can a person involve bystanders in their sexual gratification?

You seem like you disagree with my view, which is fine, but perhaps you could elaborate yours so I can see why. 

Do you beleive people can have sex publicly? If not, why?</text>

  <comment id="37039466636.0" user="lafigatatia" delta="False">
    <text>It depends.

Can you have sex in public transport? No, that's unhygienic and actually harms people.

Can you have sex in the beach with your partner? I'd never do it, but I don't see why not. You do you. My reaction would be 'wtf', not wanting them to be fined or worse. They aren't harming anybody.

However, almost nobody actually wants to have sex in public transport, in the beach or anywhere on display. There's no need to ban it. It isn't a problem at all. If you happen to see public sex once in a year you can just move on.

Edit:

Can you masturbate while looking at other people? No, that's actually involving them and breaks consent. It's already banned, because it's assault.</text>

    <text>It's not about what it would be like outside of pride. It's a demonstration to normalise LGBTQ sex as part of sex. "Sex in society", if you will.

Not to normalise public sex. The public part is just the nature of the demo.</text>

    <text>Kids should not be pushed into sexuality before they are ready, especially a pre-pubescent 10 year old. It can be very, very damaging.

It’s very different for you to seek out porn on your own, vs. an adult asking a kid if they want to watch porn. We have age of consent laws because kids do not understand all the complexities of sex, and are therefore incapable of understanding if they want it or not. There are certainly adults who do not want to go to a pride parade and see kink fetishes, a child cannot understand if they want to see it or not, and therefore you really don’t know if it’s good for them or not, or how it will affect them long term

You can teach a kid about sex when they’re of age, and in a comfortable situation. Bringing a 10 year old to a sex-parade, especially one with a niche thing like kinks, is certainly not that. And note that I say sex-parade, not pride parade, because it feels like we’re specifically talking about sex/kinks here</text>

    <text>you seeing porn before it was legal to do so does not make it a good or even neutral thing.</text>

    <text>It can definitely be argued that the minimum age to view porn/adult material should be lower, but the point here is that that same barrier should apply to kink/bdsm pride.</text>
