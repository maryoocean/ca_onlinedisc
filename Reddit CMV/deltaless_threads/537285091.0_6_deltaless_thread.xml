    <title>CMV: Not all gay people are born that way.</title>
    <original_poster>eltonjohnelway</original_poster>
    <original_post>First of all, I should make it known that I am not anti-LGBT and I believe that everyone should have equal rights and be treated fairly. I am straight but I do have a few gay and lesbian friends, coworkers, and family members. 

The common belief nowadays is that gay people are "born this way" and I can't find myself to completely believe this. I want to, as I want to be fully supportive of my gay friends. However, I am under the belief that who we are as people is almost completely defined by how we are raised and the experiences we have as children and through our entire life. IE- "we are the sum total of our experiences". I think that this expands to sexuality. I don't think there is anything wrong with this or that it is some sort of a mistake if you end up being gay. However, I do believe there is some alternate timeline/universe/ course of events ( whatever you want to call it) where certain people end up with different sexualities. In my opinion, my life could have been drastically different and I could have ended up being gay, but my cousin could have ended up straight. 

I am not trying to offend here, and I hope that it doesn't come off that way. I would truly like to have my view changed. Thank you!</original_post>

    <text>This probably isn't going to be easy to swallow, but I've never met or seen a gay person with an otherwise clean bill of mental health. You could argue it's a correlation=/=causation thing, and maybe it is, but there's a large portion of mental health issues that are acquirable, such as PTSD or some forms of depression... None of which are exactly "by choice" or voluntary in any capacity, but again, also not inborn. I'm sure some people will take umbrage with the "homosexuality is a mental illness" implications there, but it's an angle to consider, albeit not a pleasant one.</text>

    <text>True, it is a *bit* presumptuous on my part to only include people who are out of the closet on that list, but like it or not, most people in the world just aren't gay. The only people I can really be sure are gay are the ones who tell me (or the world in general) they're gay. It's a bit of an assumption, sure, but what's more of a stretch, assuming the guy I'm talking to is in the 95% majority or assuming he's in the 5% minority?

And because I know it's coming... For the purposes of this discussion, no, I can't really meaningfully refrain from assuming. We've only got two classes of people here; self-declared gays and those who have made no such declarations (either because they're still in the closet or because they're just not gay). There's no way to further sift it down as of right now.</text>
