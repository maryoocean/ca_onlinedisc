    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>The major problem with the Quebec law is that it treats religion as it treats no other cultural aspect. 
“Religion doesn’t belong in schools” is an overused canard and in my opinion false. We recognize that a public school should not be used to denigrate the faith of other people or force others to violate their beliefs, but similarly, it should not be used to uphold the false idea that religion is something to be avoided, and not practiced when in the presence of peers.</text>
