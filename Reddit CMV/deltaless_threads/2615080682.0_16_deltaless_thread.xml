    <title>CMV: Taylor Swift is the best artist of the 21st century and is on track to become the best artist of all time.</title>
    <original_poster>DesperateForYourDick</original_poster>
    <original_post>Note that here, “best” means most popular, most successful, most famous, etc. I am in no way saying that her music is the objective best music to listen to or anything like that.

Taylor Swift is a cultural phenomenon. Yes, her music is stereotypical “basic white girl music” (which is a problematic belief that many hold that I won’t get into here), but way too many people deny that she’s an all-time great just to be controversial, quirky, different, etc.

[Here is a quick list of her awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Taylor_Swift)

In addition to those, she has been on top of Billboard Artist 100 for **81 weeks**. She is the only artist to take up **every single spot** on the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time. She has multiple songs (Love Story, You Belong With Me, Shake it Off, We Are Never Getting Back Together) that have stood the test of time for a decade and will likely be classics at least on the level of songs like Hey Jude, or even We Will Rock You.

Furthermore, the Eras Tour is arguably already the most famous concert tour ever. Going by current numbers it will absolutely demolish the record for highest grossing concert tour, which was set by Elton John’s Farewell Yellow Brick Road. And it’ll do so with just 1/3 the number of concerts.

Just look at the NFL. Their Twitter account changed their profile picture, bio, and banner just because Taylor Swift showed up to a Chiefs game. To have that level of influence over the most popular sports league in the United States is insane.

Yes, I’m a big fan of her work. But even objectively speaking, I don’t see how anyone can deny that, when she does retire, she will be one of the greatest artists to ever live, just in terms of objective popularity.

And just to directly address the claims made in my title—I for one cannot name any artist with more name recognition in the 20th century. “Taylor Swift” is, at this point, used as the default name-drop for “stereotypically popular singer”. And her current level of popularity/fame is on par with any great artist (say, for example, the Beatles or Michael Jackson) at their peak, which is why I think she has a shot at becoming #1 all time.</original_post>

    <text>It doesn't really challenge your overall view as I agree that she is the most acclaimed and successful musician of 21th century by a large margin. But on a point secondary to your view: she hasn't a shot at becoming #1 of all time because she simply lacks universally known anthems. 

What is her "Yesterday-Hey-Jude-Let-it-Be-Here-comes-the-sun" or "Thriller-Billie-Jean-Beat-it" songs that everybody and not just fans can sing along in a good part of the world?

Now it can be argued that music landscape has changed and it's simply impossible for an artist in 21th century to do what the Beatles or Mickael Jackson did in their time but that's how it is.</text>

    <text>She isn't even the most successful of the 21st century though. Ed Sheeran has sold more, and so has Eminem, Kanye West, Adele And we are only talking about like 1/5th of the entire century.. it's not even close she isn't in the discussion.</text>

    <text>Absolutely wild to claim she isn’t even in the discussion. Objectively that’s not true bud</text>

    <text>If she's not in the top five by most sold albums just in this century how could you logically consider her the most successful of all time.</text>

    <text>Well where did you get your numbers? Because I know that nowadays the numbers are harder to compare as different method of album sales equivalent (since obviously most people stream instead of buying) but if believe market maker:

https://chartmasters.org/most-successful-artists-by-decade/

She outsold Ed Sheeran, Adele, Beyoncé and Kanye West. Only Eminem sold more but… well guess it’s subjective but Eminem big three albums are from 1999-2002 and the guy was born in 1972 so I he’s not very 21th century to me.

So sorry but you seem to have wrong numbers</text>

    <text>1999-2002 isn't considered 21st century to you? Thats....odd. Anyway I just finished a discussion about how drastically the music industry has changed in very recent history which makes this topic almost impossible to answer definitively.  We're essentially using statistics coming from less than 20 years of data there just isn't much comparison for any valid argument so I don't feel comfortable making one. Her ticket and physical album sales are low but that isn't accounting for digital singles and what not.</text>

    <text>Well strictly speaking, the 21th century began on 1st January 2001 so Slim Shady LP and Marshall Matters are 20th century albums.

But as I wrote: there’s a bit of subjectivity. For me Eminem is the guy who was dissing Britney and Christina Aguilera on TRL with Fred Durst so it feels like ages ago and a different era that doesn’t feel 21th century but you can have a different feeling.

And yes, like I also said, it’s a lot more difficult nowadays to compare sales number and there can be debate about it when 30 years ago, it was pretty clear who was selling more than others.

But all that being said, you cannot say that she is even in the same category than Ed Sheeran, Adele, Beyoncé and Kanye West and not even in the discussion. She probably is more successful and certainly at least in the same ballpark</text>
