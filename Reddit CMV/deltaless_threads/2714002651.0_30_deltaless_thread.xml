    <title>CMV: Capitalists hates the free market</title>
    <original_poster>SulemanDawood</original_poster>
    <original_post>Big businesses hat the idea of smaller companies rising up and challenging their market dominance which is why they try their absolute hardest to buy out every single startup they can. FAANG companies are notorious for this. They spend absurdly large sums of money which could be used to innovate on pointless mergers and acquisitions to avoid having to deal with the 'free' market. This is true even in the EU. The recent rise of Chinese EVs is driving european EVs out of the market and these companies are actively seeking to get them banned to save their own skins. Google, Amazon and Apple all continuously engage in anti-competitive practices to drive out competition because they can't deal with the fact that they can not innovate like smaller firms can. In the end capitalists are the ones destroying capitalism.</original_post>

    <text>Itâ€™s the paradox of capitalism that seeks to do everything in three most efficient (cheapest) way possible. Economies of scale heavily favor big companies so the best way to improve efficiency (profitability) is for companies to merge until there is one or only a handful of giant players left, which means that monopolies and oligopolies are inevitable in a true capitalist economy.</text>
