    <title>CMV: Downfall of News Networks is a Good Thing</title>
    <original_poster>mindtug</original_poster>
    <original_post>News thrives off fear mongering which has been detrimental for America. For instance ‘stranger danger’ caused kids across America to be locked indoors which isn’t great for development and mental health because the fear of some van taking them away, while the likelihood of your kids being kidnapped is actually extremely low. Same thing with tough on crime that went overboard causing mass incarceration and lengthened prison times making America have the biggest prisoner poppulation in the world. News talk about “How we’re more divided than ever” but they’re probably the biggest contributors. It’s important to know what’s happening but global networks such as CNN and Fox are too sensational for me to support. Should I feel sad they’re dying?</original_post>

    <text>One thing they do somewhat well is gatekeeping for facts. No matter how biased you think they are, to have something that is actually false, as opposed to misleading or badly our of context is relatively rare. Fox got sued for saying voting machines were rigged, which made them try out the defense that tucker Carlson is entertainment, not news. 

Mind you having fewer gatekeepers has pros too. Means that stuff that wouldn't normally get airtime does. Also people now have means to get their side of the story out, unfiltered. 

I expect that it will settle to a better equilibrium in the long term.</text>
