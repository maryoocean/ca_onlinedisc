    <title>CMV: Colleges in the U.S. only care about profits and protecting profit generators in the middle of a pandemic</title>

    <original_post>Okay so, as I'm sure other sports fans have noticed, the NCAA has suspended all fall championships outside of division 1 and the Big Ten has officially opted out of the 2020 fall sports season.  Basically universities are recognizing that travel and the inevitable proximity to one another is unsafe and unpredictable.  So, to protect athletes that make them millions, they are preventing competition.  This is completely reasonable and is best practice for navigating the dangers to the health of student-athletes.  

However, they seem to take no issue with bringing in students from all across the country, and in some cases different countries, to live in highly close proximity on campus and go to massive lecture halls.  Why?  As some economists have noted, many universities without huge endowments may go bankrupt without tuition and room and board expenses being maintained by students.  So, they value their profit generators (student-athletes) and want to protect them, but health and safety is out the window if that means losing out on room and board (which would occur if the fall semester was declared online only) and tuition (many students refuse to pay the same price for an online tuition and are opting to take gap years if this is the case).   

It's certainly a financially tough situation for many schools, but should maintaining revenue truly be the driving force behind holding classes in person when big univeristies are signaling that they fully understand how unsafe travelling and being in close contact with people is at this point in the U.S.?  Further, by making this choice to have classes held in person, I believe the vast majority of universities have zero actual regard for the health and well-being of their students if it hurts their pockets.  Change my view?</original_post>

    <text>Part of the problem with athletics is that the students travel between schools every week. There's no way to run intercollegiate sports without students from different colleges getting together and then dispersing again. Every match brings with it the risk of infecting the school.

The colleges and universities I have seen are letting students attend classes remotely if they want to. For those students who are eager to attend them in-person, part of the deal is that they swear not to attend off-campus parties or engage in other activities that carry a significant risk of introducing COVID into the campus community. Students also must self-isolate for two weeks before engaging in any in-person activities on campus. They must submit a report every day on whether they're experiencing any symptoms and can be ordered to stay away from class if they are. If they aren't willing to agree to those policies, they need to study remotely or take a leave of absence or deferral. If they agree to the policies and break them, they may be kicked off campus or face academic penalties like any other breach of the code of conduct.

The expectation is that students *will not* travel during the semester. Students won't be allowed to go home for the weekend, fly across the country for a job interview, or drive to the city for a party. Many schools have canceled Fall break and are going fully-remote after Thanksgiving to help avoid having students travel and return. A student who has to travel due to an emergency would be required to self-isolate and study remotely for two weeks after their return.

With athletics, you just can't do those things. You can't require that a student always remain at least 6' away from everyone and to stay even further away from those outside the school and then also encourage them to play sports that require physical contact with students from other schools.</text>
