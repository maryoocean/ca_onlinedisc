    <title>CMV: It's a good idea for bank tellers to be armed.</title>

    <original_post>I'm not entirely passionate about second amendment rights, but it just seems like a rational solution to the problem of an armed robber coming in every now and then. This won't help with any nonviolent thieves that use sneaking, hacking or bad checks, but mostly just to protect the customers and the employees themselves.

Assuming the employees are at least a little trustworthy, there's nothing to worry about. 

This isn't something I've done more than some Googling on, but it just occurred to me. Happy Friday guys.</original_post>

    <text>Why? When you bring out a gun it means you are willing to fight. 

No reason to have the teller fight, it is just money, not even their money. Company policy says just hand over the cash. </text>
