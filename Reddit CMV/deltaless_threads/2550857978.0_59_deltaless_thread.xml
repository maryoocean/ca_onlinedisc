    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>I don't believe in good and bad people. We all have good an bad qualities there are no "pure evil people" there are only good and bad actions, and in order to be a cop imo you have to engage in bad actions because the job itself is immoral (using violence to protect capital owners) they also do some good things like catching murderers and rapists but it isn't their primary function now and it wasn't when they started as slave patrols. So thats what I mean by ACAB they all have to do bad things to do their jobs</text>
