    <title>CMV: You should be allowed to take drugs and alter your conciousness in the safety of your own home.</title>

    <original_post>I believe that the government goes too far in deciding whether or not you are allowed to take drugs in the safety of your own home. You don’t stand to harm others, you only risk hurting yourself.

You can go rock climbing, skydiving, wingsuiting, rally driving and so on. 99% of the time nothing happens, and no harm is done. The same goes for drugs.

The war on drugs has done more harm than good. People who start out abuse drugs are usually doing pretty bad, and they cover up the void. That drug use only perpetuates the problem. You start failing economically, your social life declines, and the ditch just becomes too deep, so you can’t get out.

People have bad mental health, and self-medicate. I’ve been there. For me it was weed, for my grandfather it was alcohol, for some it is meth, and there are several other addictive behaviours in completely normal things, that are used to cover up a mental wound, something that hurts. Just like you get painkillers for a wound to numb the pain.

In every single drug, the abuse percentage is roughly 10%. Most users use it recreationally and only once in a while. A small part of users use it compulsively at some point in their lives.

The drug isn’t the problem, it lies in mental health. One in four people will suffer from a mental health issue during their lifetime.

Now, I don’t use drugs compulsively. I do it with friends sometimes. Sometimes I might light up a joint to unwind after work, and sometimes I take psychedelics, to expand my understanding of myself, and the world around me.

What I do at home harms doesn’t harm a single soul. What I do with my friend is nothing but bonding and fun. 

People should be allowed to do what they want, and even **if** it poses a risk, they should be allowed to do it, just as rock climbing or skydiving poses a risk.

I’d seriously like to expand my understanding of the arguments for why this shouldn’t be. We live in a world where it isn’t, and as such, I’d like to understand why.

Thank you.</original_post>

    <text>As people progress with each other throughout their lives, and learn more about the society and the people around them, they are often brushed up against dilemmas, and events. These fabricate our way of thinking. Allowing us to construct what is believed to be acceptable and what lies within the realms of needing to be corrected. Some may be better at this then others, due to the structured training that has surrounded them. These events and observations formulate the way we think and construct a set of beliefs for us as a person. The way these events unfold will heavily influence future decisions. Some drugs allow us to reflect on our future, the hopes and dreams we desire, the wishes and wants of our tomorrows. We also have drugs that mask any opportunity to think. They fabricate an entirely different understanding of what you are capable of comprehending. Then, there are drugs that completely eliminate any possibility of constructing a connective thought within oneself. These variables will influence your concept on what may be considered more respectable and enlightening, or neglectful and frightening. If consideration towards healing is implemented, then you will have a more comfortable and enlightening experience with the event. If your frame of mind is trapped in a negative state, depending on what the influential variable may be, you will not derive any sense of healing. Utilizing the word “drugs” limits your discussion path and prevents a streamlined and focused discussion as to whether or not drugs in a household may be healing. Your environment is your own and you have every right to explore yourself, just be cautious about what is involved, as well as who is involved. People can not be trusted. With advancements in security breaches, a better understanding of social constructions, and the utilization of drugs, your meth dealer could make a new friend, break your home barrier, and squish all the bugs inside of your skin! So be careful and don’t safely smoke meth.</text>
