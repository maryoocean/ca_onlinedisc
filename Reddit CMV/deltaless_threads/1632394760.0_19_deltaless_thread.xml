    <title>CMV: Space Tourism is a Waste of Resources</title>
    <original_poster>rsirdeshmukh</original_poster>
    <original_post>In 2021, three billionaires, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, and Elon Musk, entered the "space race" to take flight into space with no aim other than to reach suborbital space for a few minutes. 

While much of the world marvelled at this technological milestone, I was taken aback. If these billionaires get their way, there will be many spacecrafts jetting off to space for a joyride. This is scary because the carbon footprint of each of these space expeditions is extremely high due to the amount of fuel they use, the energy used to manufacture the fuel, and the soot generated which pollutes and damages the atmosphere while heating up the earth.

To me, space tourism seems like just an obscene display of power and wealth. With so many problems on earth, such as climate change and the pandemic, their money can be used more productively. Whether that is helping save earth or funding real space research, both are much better than just going up to space for a few minutes. Especially since doing so continues to exacerbate the wealth gap because space tourism is only a reality for those who can afford it while having serious implications on those left on earth.</original_post>

    <text>Governments going to space has proven wasteful. Since it's government, politics gets involved, especially with politicians trying to keep jobs in their districts. This is how you get the jobs program masquerading as a space program known as the SLS. We may love the Space Shuttle, but it objectively was a gross failure at its goals of cheaper launches and fast turnaround. 

Private industry such as SpaceX, in cooperation with the government, has proven to be much more efficient and has lowered cost to orbit dramatically, with the promise to lower it even more. To do this they need income. That can come from commercial or government launches, or tourism. 

Bezos also has the goal of useful space travel, although he's far behind SpaceX so right now he can only do suborbital tourism to bring in income. Branson, well, you're right there, it's just about tourism. But even that gets people more interested in space, which is a good thing.</text>
