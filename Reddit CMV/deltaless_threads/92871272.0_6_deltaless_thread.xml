    <title>I don't think the NSA spying on us is such a big deal. CMV</title>

    <original_post>Here is my reasoning: growing up parallel to the development of the internet my parents always warned me that anything you put into a computer someone out there can see. It is permanent. So I have always assumed there is always someone watching. That assumption at the end of the day hasn't really changed what I put on the internet because everything is strictly my opinion and I don't care what others think of it.

As far as the recording of phone conversations and storing of email, that is just a case of national security. these things need to be saved in case someone is planning a terrorist attack on our nation IMO.	

I am just a normal citizen like many of you, but my opinion differs on this subject matter and I want to understand what the big fuss about it is. It has always just been a common knowledge and understanding for me that I am being watched.</original_post>

    <text>Regardless of the moral implications, the act itself is an egregious violation of the Bill of Rights. It definitely disregards the Fourth Amendment:

&amp;gt; The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

Our country has decided that the laws don't need to be followed by the government, and there's nothing we can do about it.

I forget who said it (maybe Hamilton?), but "the people should not be afraid of the government; the government should be afraid of its people." In essence, the people should not have to tread carefully when conducting private affairs (as is the result since the Snowden Exposure). Our forefathers had put in a system of checks and balances to combat an overpowered monarch as had been the case in Europe, but in the past couple hundred years, those balances have been skewed, and the Executive Branch is still equal to the other two, but it is "more equal".</text>
