    <title>CMV: The Middle East will be consumed by chaos for the rest of the 21st Century</title>
    <original_poster>AssFaceKillaaa</original_poster>
    <original_post>Change takes a long time. Things happen overnight, but we don't see true effects until removed by a generation or two. There have been myriad of conflicts in the middle east for the entirety of my life, as well as most of the last century. Over the course of the last Century, The Middle East was thrown into Chaos due to many factors: 

-The redrawing of borders which effectively isolated portions of ethnic or religious groups into minority/majority regions that would form the basis of targeted persecution for regimes at later times (disbanding the Ottoman Empire/reshaping political landscape of the region).

-The discovery of massive oil reserves across the region which would turn some states into the massive economic powers (Saudi Arabia/Iran/Qatar/UAE... and on and on) that would drastically effect their relation to the rest of the world.

 -The formation of the State of Israel, and subsequent dissimilation of Palestine (this one should be obvious..)

-The growth of what would become an endemic trend of militia groups backed by states foreign or otherwise for purposes of fighting Proxy-Wars or affecting regional influence. (i.e. Mujahideen turned into Taliban turned into Al-Qeadea turned into ISIS...)

Because of these and many other reasons, I believe that the region as a whole will continue to see failing Nation States, massive civilian casualties, continued violent confrontations between Nations, Rebel groups, and civilians, and systemic corruption for *at least* the next 85 years. **I don't believe through supporting Regime Change, or diplomatically informed policy decisions will affect meaningful change in the region in this century.**

 Or to put it another way: *The damage has been done.*

    <text>Consider this. The modern nation of Tanzania is one the most diverse nations in all of Africa and the world. It is home to nomads, farmers, various tribes mountain people, Catholics, Protestants, Muslims, etc. and yet it is also one of the most stable and successful nation in Africa post colonization. I'm not saying it is a pillar of progress, but simply that Tanzania despite its vast diversity is very stable. So if colonial borders, ethnic, and religious minorities aren't the issue, what is?

The answer to that is as you said, the propaganda and weapons supplied by foreign nations fueling proxy wars. I also agree this will continue, but with a caveat. Just as damage has been done by foreigners, so too can it be healed by foreigners. If decisive action is taken by the world community to cut the supply of weapons into the Middle East (the USA is currently supplying every side of the Syrian Civil War) and to help build up its people and infrastructure it is entirely conceivable that this turmoil will gradually come to an end and the region can see just as wide a success as places like South Korea. Often all it takes is just a little stability for a country to get itself stuck in a virtuous cycle of progressive development (look at Vietnam post war)!</text>
