    <title>CMV: Legislative bodies should be required to explain, in formal writing, why they voted a certain way when it comes to legislation.</title>

    <original_post>I think publicly elected officials responsible for driving policy and legislation should be required to explain why they vote certain ways in writing. Voting along party lines is reprehensible regardless of the side. Politics shouldn't be a game about which side wins, but rather which fact-based opinions win regardless of sides. If the legislative bodies have no reasonable explanation for why they voted a certain way besides voting along party lines, they should not be allowed to vote because we have no reason to believe that they're not voting out of self-interest. If, for example, someone in Congress voted against what seems to be reasonable gun law without explanation, but you can see in their financial disclosure that the NRA contributes a lot of money and support for them, how are we to know that their vote was not influenced by the NRA without them explicitly citing so and explaining what other reason compelled them not to vote for said reasonable legislation? I'm not even asking for a long written response from them. A short paragraph or page summary with sources they're using to base their vote on is good enough. </original_post>

    <text>You seem to be under a misapprehension about what Democratic Republics are for: The job of a legislator is to *represent* their constituents. 

The only valid reason for a legislator to vote on a bill either way is "because I think that's what the people that voted for me would want". It absolutely doesn't matter whether the vote is "fact based" or "justified by sources". All that matters is whether they are doing their job of representing their voters. 

And the only people qualified to decide whether they are doing this properly are the aforementioned constituents, who will voice their opinion at the next elections. </text>
