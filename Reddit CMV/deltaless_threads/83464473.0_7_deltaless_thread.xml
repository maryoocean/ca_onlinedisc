    <title>I believe that prayer does nothing to change the world. CMV</title>

    <original_post>Prayer as an act of reaching to a deity for help or comfort has no appreciable effect beyond what can be achieved by normal positive thinking.

Praying to end world hunger or to get a job has no effect unless you or someone else makes the decision to achieve the goal. These goals could also just as easily be achieved without prayer.

Edit: I do not believe in the non corporeal nature of prayer. I do believe in the effects such as positive thinking giving someone a better understanding of who they are a what they can do.</original_post>

    <text>I think there is a slight logical disconnect in the original post.  If the effect of prayer is no different than "normal positive thinking" then, perhaps the OP should think of prayer as "religious positive thinking."

Otherwise, anytime anyone would suggest that any prayer ever had any positive effect, the OP could simply say "well that is just positive thinking."

Perhaps, the clearer challenge would be: "I believe prayer to disconnected 3rd parties cannot possibly have any impact on the 3rd party, CMV."</text>
