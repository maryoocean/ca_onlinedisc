    <title>CMV: You should be allowed to take drugs and alter your conciousness in the safety of your own home.</title>
    <original_poster>Cheezefebreeze</original_poster>
    <original_post>I believe that the government goes too far in deciding whether or not you are allowed to take drugs in the safety of your own home. You don’t stand to harm others, you only risk hurting yourself.

You can go rock climbing, skydiving, wingsuiting, rally driving and so on. 99% of the time nothing happens, and no harm is done. The same goes for drugs.

The war on drugs has done more harm than good. People who start out abuse drugs are usually doing pretty bad, and they cover up the void. That drug use only perpetuates the problem. You start failing economically, your social life declines, and the ditch just becomes too deep, so you can’t get out.

People have bad mental health, and self-medicate. I’ve been there. For me it was weed, for my grandfather it was alcohol, for some it is meth, and there are several other addictive behaviours in completely normal things, that are used to cover up a mental wound, something that hurts. Just like you get painkillers for a wound to numb the pain.

In every single drug, the abuse percentage is roughly 10%. Most users use it recreationally and only once in a while. A small part of users use it compulsively at some point in their lives.

The drug isn’t the problem, it lies in mental health. One in four people will suffer from a mental health issue during their lifetime.

Now, I don’t use drugs compulsively. I do it with friends sometimes. Sometimes I might light up a joint to unwind after work, and sometimes I take psychedelics, to expand my understanding of myself, and the world around me.

What I do at home harms doesn’t harm a single soul. What I do with my friend is nothing but bonding and fun. 

People should be allowed to do what they want, and even **if** it poses a risk, they should be allowed to do it, just as rock climbing or skydiving poses a risk.

I’d seriously like to expand my understanding of the arguments for why this shouldn’t be. We live in a world where it isn’t, and as such, I’d like to understand why.

Thank you.</original_post>

Please provide a credible source that states this.</text>

    <text>I can’t find where I originally found the statistic, but here is one with quite similar results. The second page shows what I was talking about.

https://www.unodc.org/wdr2017/field/WDR_2017_presentation_lauch_version.pdf

The one I originally read had statistics for several drugs.

Edit: I remember that with Heroin it was 20%. And that alcohol also had higher rates than drugs like cannabis. With alcohol, I believe it is a question of availability and legality. With heroin, I believe it is because those who already abuse drugs try more, and end up with substances like heroin, creating a pool of addicts.</text>

    <text>Reading that tells me the statistic isn't "In every single drug, the abuse percentage is roughly 10%", it's "When looking at every person who takes drugs put together, 10% of them are drug abusers". Some of those drugs like heroin or meth have much higher addiction/abuse rates than 10%. Providing access or a free pass to use those drugs will undoubtedly lead to higher addiction rates.

I agree that recreational drugs should be legalized, but they need to be heavily, heavily regulated to avoid things like opioid abuse. It shouldn't be some free-for-all.</text>

    <text>I believe that every drug should be regulated, including Alcohol. In my country you can’t buy as much hard alcohol as you want, because the government owns all the shops and makes sure you don’t buy too much.

No drug should be abused, and if someone buys a lot, you offer them therapy. The swiss did this during their opioid crisis, and it had tremendous results.</text>

    <text>I get that but the basis of your argument is people should be free to take drugs and alter your consciousness in your own home. No where in your argument did you say it should be heavily regulated - you stated:

&amp;gt;I believe that the government goes too far in deciding whether or not you are allowed to take drugs in the safety of your own home

What I'm proposing is the legalization or recreational drugs, but with a huge asterisk. The government SHOULD decide if you are allowed to take drugs in the safety of your own home by regulating things like opioids very heavily.</text>

    <text>Opioids have extremely high harm potential because of overdose. When it comes to those drugs, they should be taken on site, like the swiss did it. That way the dose can be measured so that you cannot overdose, and you don’t have any spare so that you can exceed that threshold.

Yes, it is a bit contradictory to my own statement, but these drugs are an exception. They are in exception to other drugs; the most abused, and therefore in exception to other drugs, they should be regulated.

I believe the drugs should be regulated by harm potential, and also to stop them from being sold to other people.</text>
