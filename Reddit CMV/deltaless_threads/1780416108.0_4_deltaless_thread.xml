    <title>CMV: The West does not understand Russia and its efforts to make it capitulate won't come into fruition</title>
    <original_poster>Tasogare80s</original_poster>
    <original_post>Russia and Russian politics in general is vastly different from the long-standing democratic societies of Western countries. The perception of western countries that Russia will ultimately capitulate due to economic pressures is presumptuous, primarily because it assumes that Russia operates on the same status quo that western countries do.

If and when a democratic country enters a war, public pressure and change in leadership ensures a war's end so long as the public deems it unworthy of continuation. Russia is a non-democratic society, to which the constraints of public opinion do not bind the Russian state to the opinions of its people due to it not caring about what the people think and its irrelevance to the decision-making process.

In some parts of Europe, parliaments have existed since the medieval ages, which eventually became our models for modern parliamentarianism and republican democracy. Russia never experienced these developments and hence from Tsardom to Soviet to the modern era, the public opinion of your average Russian is irrelevant. The only parliament that Russia ever had was the Zemsky Sobor, which only approved the line of succession for Tsars whose sole and only purpose and power was taken away by Tsar Peter I. This is important because Russian society did not experience the same thing that western democracies did, and hence assuming that they function in a similar way is flawed.

One important thing to note is that because of this, every time the Russian state and country underwent hardship they willingly outsourced their hardships on their people. Knowing full well that the people are incapable of rebellion and the nobility being so weak, as a result of their deprivation of rights and strengths to even affect anything. When Soviet Russia was undergoing economic hardship during the 20s Stalin blamed the kulaks. When Peter the Great went to war against Sweden, he incentivized nobles with tax breaks if they taxed their peasants effectively. I am willing to bet that Putin does not care about the average Russian pensioner and if shit hits the fan he will outsource the consequences of his war, to his people.

Additionally, when Stalin purged the kulaks, he also purged the Soviet military and politicians, replacing his power base anew. When Ivan the Terrible's power was being questioned by the nobility and boyars, he engaged in a political purge that executed most of the Russian aristocracy. Putin's support when he rose to power were former KGB agents and when he consolidated his power, he was backed by the oligarchs. There are now rumours that Putin has surrounded himself with right-wing ideologues like Alexandre Dugin and the military elite. The Russian nobility is interchangeable and they aren't cemented within the political system. Hence if the oligarchs feel that their profits are going dry due to sanctions, all Putin has to do is arrest them, shoot them or sack them to fall in line. 

If history tells us anything Russia is going to crackdown hard on its own people and engage in another political purge.</original_post>

    <text>Hello! 

I agree the West and Russia are very different and our perception of things can change, especially as you noted with government oppression and large state burdens but this does not mean that Russia will not feel the burn of sanctions. Russia still needs to feed and produce, not only to stay stable but also to stay safe. 

It is entirely plausible that Putin remains in power but due to an inability to trade or efficiently engage in an increasingly advanced and decentralised global economy, Russia becomes a hermit kingdom without any real power or influence with an objectively worse standard of living. Think 'sick man of Europe'. In the modern day I think this would even be accentuated, you can't build modern standard tanks or jets in one country, globalised network and producers are more specialised than ever and cannot be developed by one country alone. The chip shortage right now shows that, if the entire globe can't get silicon manufacturering increased to meet essentially infinite demand for 2 years now, how can Russia by itself?

While I don't think history is predictive of the future and shouldn't be relied on too much in speculation, this very situation is famous in 20th century Russia. In WW1, Russia could not produce goods or feed its gargantuan population and thus could not adequately compete with Germany, despite British efforts to arm them. You have stories of soldiers sent to war without bullets and more due to increasingly inept authoritarian rule and economic management of Tsar Nicholas II leading to the Russian revolution. While this essentially replaced one dictatorship with another eventually, it goes against your assertion that they are immune from civil unrest and that won't feel economic whiplash.

Regardless of outcome, Putin remaining in charge or not, Russia will feel this.</text>
