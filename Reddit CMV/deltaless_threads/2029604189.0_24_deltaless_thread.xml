    <title>CMV: Sustainability, from a philosophical perspective, is misguided</title>
    <original_poster>Pyropeace</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've been an advocate of sustainability for a while. However, I've recently begun to question the underlying assumptions behind the sustainability movement. 

Nothing is truly, infinitely sustainable. The sun will eventually go nova, killing everyone on earth (if humans haven't already gone extinct by then). If humanity manages to escape Earth, then the universe will likely perish as well, depending on what model you accept. The universe is in a constant state of change, and nothing lasts forever. Is it better to be moderately happy for a long period of time or extremely happy for a short period of time? When talking about entire societies, I tend towards the latter, though on an individual basis I tend towards the former. 

Essentially, my question is this; what is the value in things that last a long time in a universe where nothing is eternal?</original_post>

    <text>This is true, and sustainability should focus not on our current idea of sustainability, but on what I'm going to call Sustainability of Expansion. This basically means that we're securing access to more materials than the rate we're projected to use them with unrestricted growth. By this logic, we should focus far more on things like deep sea mining, space exploration, and really the true industrialization of space. We've got 5 billion years to make it out of the system, which is the sort of time limit that seems fine now, but we're still on our first world and haven't even fully conquered that, the benchmark of doing so presumably being becoming a Type 1 civilization on the Kardashev scale. 

The interesting question is what does this mean for humanity? Do we want to exponentially expand forever? Even without FTL, we could reasonably colonize the entire galaxy, build some sort of even bigger Dyson sphere around the supermassive black hole at the center of the milky way. It's theoretically possible to extract energy from black holes, and that big of one would be a fairly good lifeboat for the heat death of the universe, doubly so as you can throw more matter into it to recharge it.</text>
