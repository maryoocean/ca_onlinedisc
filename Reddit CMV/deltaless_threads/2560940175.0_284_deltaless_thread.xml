    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>I wonder if this is because people from Europe are called "Europeans", rather than their actual nationality? They are much more aware of the distinction between continent and State, so maybe they think Americans need to be, as well?

Central and South American peoples don't call themselves Americans. They go by their nationality, or sometimes their ethnicity. Canadians call themselves Canadians. We kind of don't have any other name for ourselves than "Americans", and since nobody else is claiming it...</text>
