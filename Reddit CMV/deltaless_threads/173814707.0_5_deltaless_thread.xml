    <title>CMV: Focusing too narrowly on the plot of movies is a shallow way of experiencing and critiquing them</title>
    <original_poster>sloggz</original_poster>
    <original_post>Often when I see movie criticism, either on Reddit or in person, I see people focusing on critiquing the plot of films. They'll say things like "the story was great, up until *blank* and then it totally ruined it for me". There is also a general focus on spoilers, plot holes, etc.


Now, I don't think there is necessarily anything wrong with people viewing film this way, I just think it's shallow. And I don't mean shallow in a wholly negative way, I just mean it as exactly as it is, shallow, close to the surface, without depth.


Films, as an art-form are an immensely complex and intriguing form of entertainment. They combine all the aspects of music, photography, writing, performing, digital effects and art, set design and sound production into an end result that can often be greater than the sum of its parts. To reduce all of these aspects of film to just the narrative of the story and the literal events of the movie is to ignore and not appreciate a massive part of the experience.


Not that plot isn't an important part of movies. I love movies with complex, interesting plots, but I also love movies without them. A complex narrative is in no way, a pre-requisit to a good movie. Just as it's not a requirement for a good novel or anything. It helps, and it can add to or make a good film even great, but it is not all there is.


Basically, my view is that modern mainstream critiquing of movies - what your family members discuss after leaving the cinema, or what people say around the water-cooler at work, (or what is often said in discussion posts of films at /r/movies, is far too focused on the plot of movies. Movie fans everywhere are doing themselves a disservice and would enjoy the movies they watch more if they changed the way they thought about them.


I equate it to people judging music solely on the lyrics.


So! please, try to change my view, as I am clearly in the minority. Why would it not be better for general audiences in general to be more well-rounded film viewers?

    <text>The plot is the center of the movie upon which everything else you're referring to is built upon.

Plot issues - be they holes, unanswered questions, poor flow, whatever - can break the suspension of disbelief and take you out of the experience.

It's great if the plot is original or complex - but it's not strictly necessary if other aspects of the film are... it' just needs to *work* at a fundamental level.

I'm not sure the music analogy works, given how lyrics are often very secondary to instrumentals/beat in many genres... but it's perfectly reasonable for atrocious lyrics to ruin how a song is perceived for similar reasons.

I kind of think of it like having a nice car but with a terribly unreliable transmission... in the end it negates *a lot* from my experience and will be the thing I remember.  Sure, academically I might recognize other parts of the car I liked, but it's fine to have deal breakers.</text>
