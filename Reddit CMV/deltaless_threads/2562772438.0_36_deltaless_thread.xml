    <title>CMV: It is illogical to not believe in Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>LAMARR__44</original_poster>
    <original_post>Many people either believe in Hard Determinism or Compatibilism. I will argue that both are illogical.

Both argue that human actions are extensions of factors we do not have a choice over. Compatibilism seems to say we are still free but just redefines free will to the internal factors behind a decision, but the decision is still decided by a chain of events outside of our control.

My argument is a sort of wager argument. Either libertarian free will exists or it doesn’t. If it exists and we believe in it, we have made a free decision where we are right. If libertarian free will doesn’t exist, the decision to believe in libertarian free will was out of our control.

So either we have a choice and we can make the right choice, or we don’t have a choice and were determined to be wrong.

Thus it makes more sense to believe in libertarian free will since it’s potentially the only one where we have a chance to make a right choice, if determinism is true there is no choice, so there’s no value in being right.</original_post>

    <text>I upvoted this, because it's a fun interesting idea, I never heard about before. If it's so obviously wrong, it should be easy to refute you.

&gt;  If it exists and we believe in it, we have made a free decision where we are right. \[***agree***\]
&gt; If libertarian free will doesn’t exist, the decision to believe in libertarian free will was out of our control. \[***agree***\]

&gt; So either we have a choice and we can make the right choice, or we don’t have a choice and were determined to be wrong.

That's only talking about people who believe in libertarian free will, of course. Someone who believes in free will can also believe that not *every* decision is free, only some. I wouldn't say that the belief that penguins can't fly or the belief that 2+2=4 is a chosen belief. The evidence forces you to belief those things. You could also have a person that believes that evidence forces them to belief in free will – that's not a contradiction.

&gt; if determinism is true there is no choice

In without free will, you can still have *will*, i.e. choices, it just wouldn't be *free*.

&gt;  if determinism is true there is no choice, so there’s no value in being right.

Many opinions are important to be correct: For example, if you are in the forest and hungry and you find mushrooms, it's critical for survival that your opinion whether the mushrooms is poisonous corresponds to reality. If you belief that the mushrooms is poisonous and it actually is, you survive.

The correct opinion on free will is not critical for survival on first glace, but if free will actually doesn't exist, it would only be possible to believe in it, when you make some errors in other areas that could indirectly be related for survival. Expressed more simply: If someone has *unimportant* wrong beliefs, that could indicate they are *stupid*, and that indicates that they also have *important* wrong beliefs.  
I'm not saying that everyone who beliefs in libertarian free will is stupid. Obviously there are some highly educated and successful professors who belief in libertarian free will. But if there are errors in their arguments, that is something that matters.

-------------

I'm not 100% sure where the error in your argument is exactly, but let me ask you a question back:

What would you tell someone who says that they can determine the answer to math questions freely? Like, someone asks them what 2+2 is, and they answer "2+2=14, because today I chose it to be 14". How is that statement different from saying "I have free will, because I chose it to be that way."?</text>

    <text>Well 2+2=14 has nothing to with the act of being able to make a choice. The free will vs determinism case is unique because you’re making a choice on whether you can make a choice. So either you can make choices, which then you should always choose free will, or you can’t make choices, and thus if you choose free will or determinism you’d have no other option. With 2+2=14, its decision is based simply on the rationality of mathematics, not the ontology of choice. My argument is based on free will being good, but that if we can choose it makes sense to choose free will, if free will is true, we would’ve made the right decision, otherwise we couldn’t make any other decision so why feel bad about it?</text>

    <text>I think all beliefs should be connected to evidence and logic, including the belief in free will. You probably disagree and I don't think I can justify that further.

Speaking of evidence, I think there is at least nothing that indicates that the origin of our decisions is necessarily different from either deterministic causes or randomness. Sometimes you are even mentally aware of the cause of your desires and actions and if you aren't, there could be subconscious causes. That neatly fits together with the theories about inanimate physics, so if you like Occam's Razor or the principle of parsimony, it's preferable to believe the theory, that causes less problems.

Your view that free will is desirable over no free will is challenged at other comments. For example, you don't actually need to be defeatist and you don't need to tolerate crime, if you don't believe in free will.</text>
