    <title>CMV: The only form of government that exists is Opportunism</title>
    <original_poster>jerkularcirc</original_poster>
    <original_post>Everything else is just propaganda. History has proven time and time again that countries will always do/find a way to do what they think is in their best interest, quite irrespective of morality, laws, or even their own “constitution”. These labels of government and/or thinking one type of governing is always better than another is purely a result of propaganda and has been a great blinder throughout history. 

In group vs out group aka “us vs. them” thinking has been shown by research to be one of the best predictors of human thought and behavior and it has been utilized by those in power for much of human history to control the masses.</original_post>

    <text>I see it as, it depends on the governing body and the people involved in said body. It also depends heavily on other factors, such as economics, military, land mass, political climate, etc

The bigger the government the more likely money and corruption will seep in, as there will always be people who will try to benefit themselves, but we shouldn't label everything else as propaganda just because we think that it's all about opportunism.

We should be focusing on electing officials with good track records rather than party aliments/affiliation</text>
