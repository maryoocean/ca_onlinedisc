    <title>CMV: The only difference between AI (digital) life and human (physical) life is the material which sustains it</title>
    <original_poster>CarpeBedlam</original_poster>
    <original_post>To be clear, I’m talking about a theoretical AI which is designed specifically to be indistinguishable from a human, and accomplishes that goal. Also, I don’t necessarily mean an android that is physically equivalent (e.g. Ash from “Alien”), but just a digital consciousness living in a computer which is capable of replicating human behavior. At that point, I’m struggling to find a difference between the two that isn’t solely about the material required to sustain the life (blood, tissue, etc. for human life, silicon, copper, etc. for AI life).</original_post>

    <text>AI is a group of algorithms that recognizes patterns (essentially just a bunch of math operations) powered by a computer. Why is a series of transistors and circuits any more “life” than a piece of wire on the ground. Do you believe arranging non-sentient objects in a certain way unlocks consciousness?</text>
