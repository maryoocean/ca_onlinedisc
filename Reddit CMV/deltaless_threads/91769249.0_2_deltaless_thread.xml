    <title>People should not break up fights unless one of the fighters explicitly states that they don't want to be fighting. CMV</title>
    <original_poster>Taylor_Vontell</original_poster>
    <original_post>This has always been a major peeve of mine. I like watching random people fight, and I've been in a few myself. Every time there's a fight, some asshole decides to be a hero and try to break it up. Back in high school, these two kids pulled us apart even though we both explicitly stated that we wanted to fight. Now, I understand why a teacher, cop, or bouncer would do it, nothing against them, but if you're not an authority figure or at risk of injury or property damage yourself, you should let the people fight. For example, if you form a fight ring in high school around the two combatants, then no one is getting hurt, and nor is anyone not involved in the fight getting injured. In that case, no one should intervene unless an authority figure arrives. 

Now of course, there are exceptions. For example, if one person clearly does not want to be in the fight, then someone should break it up. For example, they may be asking for help or just being pummeled without throwing any punches themselves. Or if you witnessed the fight from the very beginning and one guy clearly just attacked the other without provocation. Then you should break up the fight. 

Otherwise, two adults should be allowed to fight and no one should intervene until one of them either states that he does not want to fight anymore, or is put into a state into which he cannot express this desire. Otherwise, people should just enjoy the show and mind their own fucking business.

    <text>The real problem with a scenario like this is that legally, the person who inflicts the injuries is responsible, even if there is retaliation. As a result, you could essentially "consent" to fight (even though this consent is invalid), and subsequently be hit with the other person's medical bills or charged with assault.

Also, there are numerous reasons why people would appear to want to fight but actually would not. Be it taunting, daring by friends, a matter of personal honor or pride, or any number of reasons, someone could be fighting but not _really_ want to, and in the moment, no one can determine that accurately.

Finally, your example mentions high school, but then subsequently mentions adults. People in high school are not adults, and cannot legally give independent consent on a large range of issues.</text>

    <text>When I get into a fight, I am aware that I may go to jail or take a trip to the hospital. I accept this risk and still want to fight. 

If someone is fighting because they're proud or egged on, then they can still fight. If they change their mind mid fight, they can communicate their desire to stop the fight. 

I brought up the high school example because that is where I have experienced it prior to going to the bar. It is the school's job to ensure that the fights to not happen, which is why I stated that I have nothing against authority figures breaking up fights. However, other students are not authority figures and are by extention, not allowed to decide for other people what's best since they are not old enough either. </text>

I don't think this is what /r/Armanewb meant. Two of you could "agree" to a fight, both giving consent, and then the first punch you throw could break the other guy's jaw and just like that... you've got a $30,000 medical bill of his that you have to pay for him because you broke his jaw, even though he "gave consent" to fight.

People may say they "want to fight", but they probably don't really want to take full responsibility for whatever damage the fight causes to themselves or to the other fighter(s).</text>

    <text>Well in the case of legal consent...well I'll just leave this here: [Assumption of Risk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assumption_of_risk)

My biggest problem with OP's view is that the kind of people who tend to get in fights are the same kind who tend not to carry health insurance (and in the case of intentional acts, such as fights, insurance won't cover medical bills).  Thus, the costs of their injuries are ultimately passed on to taxpayers and those of us who do carry insurance.</text>
