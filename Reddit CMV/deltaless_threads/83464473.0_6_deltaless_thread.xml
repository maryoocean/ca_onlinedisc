    <original_post>Prayer as an act of reaching to a deity for help or comfort has no appreciable effect beyond what can be achieved by normal positive thinking.

Praying to end world hunger or to get a job has no effect unless you or someone else makes the decision to achieve the goal. These goals could also just as easily be achieved without prayer.

Edit: I do not believe in the non corporeal nature of prayer. I do believe in the effects such as positive thinking giving someone a better understanding of who they are a what they can do.</original_post>

    <text>One unique aspect of prayer(over positive thinking) is that it lets you stops being focused on yourself, you wants and your needs, and becoming focused on a "higher being" which usually has more communal values. 

So it might change you're mind in those ways which from psychology we know does hold some benefits: Thinking about other people helps you achieve better relationships, and less self focus might make you happier. 

There might be certain patterns of thinking that could achieve this without prayer, but many positive thinking patterns do not. </text>
