    <title>CMV: People forgo their right to complain if they never do anything about it</title>
    <original_poster>ooselfie</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have a few friends that complain about their life ALL the time. I hear things like:

"My job sucks, I'm miserable here"

"God school sucks, I'm studying something so uninteresting"

I think they have total control - it comes down to laziness, or perhaps they don't even really want anything to happen. It is so easy to put in some extra effort in your day to make things happen for yourself. They complain and complain but never do anything to change. It's like the boy who cried wolf. 

If you constantly complain, but do nothing to mend the problem, then you shouldn't be allowed to complain.

    <text>Complaining is covered under free speech and there’s nothing anyone can do to take it from you that wouldn’t be a violation of basic human rights. 

It is your right to be able to complain about things if you really want to. 

Other people are allowed to judge you based on it, though. So in your example you said they forgo the right because they don’t do anything about it,  but it’s there right to not do anything about it and complain about it. It’s your right to either ignore them or call them a lazy idiot. </text>
