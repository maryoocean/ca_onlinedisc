    <title>CMV: Space Tourism is a Waste of Resources</title>
    <original_poster>rsirdeshmukh</original_poster>
    <original_post>In 2021, three billionaires, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, and Elon Musk, entered the "space race" to take flight into space with no aim other than to reach suborbital space for a few minutes. 

While much of the world marvelled at this technological milestone, I was taken aback. If these billionaires get their way, there will be many spacecrafts jetting off to space for a joyride. This is scary because the carbon footprint of each of these space expeditions is extremely high due to the amount of fuel they use, the energy used to manufacture the fuel, and the soot generated which pollutes and damages the atmosphere while heating up the earth.

To me, space tourism seems like just an obscene display of power and wealth. With so many problems on earth, such as climate change and the pandemic, their money can be used more productively. Whether that is helping save earth or funding real space research, both are much better than just going up to space for a few minutes. Especially since doing so continues to exacerbate the wealth gap because space tourism is only a reality for those who can afford it while having serious implications on those left on earth.</original_post>

    <text>I think it's a great way to get people excited for space and ultimately, science. SpaceX, for instance, allows you to watch their takeoffs/landings which is a remarkable feat in-itself, but it lets people get interested in how it actually works during flight rather than "explosion out back makes rocket go up". 

Sure, you can make the argument that we technically don't *need* "space tourism", but you can extend that to basically every facet of life that isn't life or death. 

Like all new things, you have to pay an early-adopter tax. Space tourism is no different. It may be extremely expensive now, but innovations always lower costs. Take air travel, for example. It used to cost quite a lot and reserved for the wealthy, but now it's \*fairly\* cheap and accessible. 

I obviously am not saying that the cost of a ticket to go on a rocket into space will be anywhere near the price of an airline ticket, but I think that the price will definitely drop and become accessible to even the upper-middle class.</text>
