    <title>[Mod Post] Welcome to all new readers!</title>
    <original_poster>IAmAN00bie</original_poster>
    <original_post>**This is Mod post 22. You can read the previous Mod Post by clicking [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e5yke/mod_post_looking_for_a_wiki_mod/), or by visiting the [Mod Post Archive](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/modpostarchive) in our wiki.**  

---          

I noticed there was a HUGE influx of new users just now, and I was confused on where they were coming from. Well, I was tipped off by a friendly user that [AdviceAnimals had mentioned us] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1ea3h6/got_an_essay_due_im_sure_someones_done_this_before/) in one of their top rated posts! To all new users coming in from AdviceAnimals, welcome! We're a (relatively) small community compared to you, but we hope that your thankfully positive attention to us will bring in more good members!  

Since there are a lot of new members coming in, I would also like to remind people to please **read the sidebar!** Following the rules of this subreddit is essential in making sure that we have good, healthy discussion about all sorts of topics.  

Also, I want to plug our newly created IRC channel: #changemyview on Snoonet! [You can join us by following this link here] (https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/changemyview?settings=dd892af474749b032ba39bb88a8894d9).   

edit: **the subreddit is public again, I disabled submissions for 15 minutes so us mods can catch up with this traffic!**  

edit 2: **DELTA BOT HAS LIKELY CRASHED DUE TO THE OVERWHELMING ACTIVITY!** Don't worry, we'll catch all the missed delta awardings when the owner reboots the poor bot :(

    <text>I'm one of the new users.  I wish I'd known about this subreddit on my previous names.  I don't know what the threads looked like before but I agree it does look like a few of them don't *seem* to fit in with the ethos that the rules imply.  That said, people will get bored and this will probably taper off, so I'm excited to see what happens in this subreddit.  Thanks, mods.</text>

    <text>There was a mix of good threads (they usually include OP expanding their opinion in text), lazy OP and propagandy threads with inflammatory titles and hardly any delta to be seen in the long discussion threads. The usual discussion topics of reddit are brought up but different ideas and topics come up very regularly, which make this sub really worth surveying ! 

Browse the /new/ tab if you want to participate as new comments in the top threads are usually of little interest (since what you want to say has very likely been brought up already or is off-topic). </text>
