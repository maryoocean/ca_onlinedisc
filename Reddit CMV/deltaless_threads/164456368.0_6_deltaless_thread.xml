    <title>CMV: Jesus is not that unique of a figure</title>
    <original_poster>CantPenTheSnowden</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've always wondered why people are so obsessed with this Jesus character.

His messages are not unique, in fact they are rather common knowledge, except for the few clever sayings that are attributed to him. Feed the poor, don't let your heart be consumed with wealth and material goods, believe in a higher power, do unto others what you want others to do to you etc. are all common sayings that were preached by hundreds of sages before and after the life and death of Jesus. 

I think of Jesus as being another charismatic figure whose death or martyrdom was made into a legend by his followers in order to legitimize Christendom. I mean what other fashion can you justify genocide, bigotry and forced conversion other than proclaiming that your message is about peace and love? This sort of doublethink astounds me.

    <text>Let's set aside the question of whether Christians' belief of the divinity of Jesus is valid (it's a massively important and relevant question, but I don't think that's what you're here to discuss).

Now, your point seems to say that his ideas weren't original - that others have championed peace, and charity and most of the elements of Jesus's teachings.   Therefore, he was nothing special, and any of a number of people "could have been" Jesus. (ever see Life of Brian?)

But they weren't - and that's the key.  Greatness requires skills, absolutely.  It's safe to say that Jesus was well above average in compassion, public speaking and philosophy.  But it also requires opportunity.  A poor-born Thomas Jefferson wouldn't have become a great statesman.  An Einstein born in the middle ages would have either been ignored or executed.  It doubtful that a Hitler born 200 years earlier would have had much of an impact.  Jackson Pollack born during the time of the Dutch Masters?  J.K. Rowling born in 1750?

The point is that he's unique because he's the who inspired one of the world's largest religions.  He arrived at a time and a place where his message was ripe to be spread, but he had the combination of oratory and charisma to inspire thousands to work to inspire tens of thousands who inspired millions.
