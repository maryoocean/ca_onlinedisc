    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>1. If you make schools hostile to religion, religious parents won't send their children there and will raise them in a hardcore religious environment instead. They won't make friends outside of their community or get exposed to new ideas - many religious teenagers actually end up abandoning the faith after going to school (its what happened to me). 
2. 1. If kids want to wear a hijab/turban/jewish cap I think that's up to them.</text>
