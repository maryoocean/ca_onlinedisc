    <title>cmv: Canada should install dirty atomic bombs in each big lake as an invasion deterrent.</title>
    <original_poster>maxi1134</original_poster>
    <original_post>With the upcoming climate changes and the fact that Canada has 20% of the freshwater reserve in the world. Russia, America, and other states might have an interest in invading Canada to access the water reserves and the Canadian north that will taw out and become available for crops.    
  

With this information, I believe that rigging the water table to be radioactive for eons in case of invasion would be the perfect deterrent to prevent the invasion from any other state.   

  

Especially America, as their water table would then also be contaminated</original_post>

    <text>Global warming means more rainfall planet-wide.  The problem is that the rainfall will be in different spots than today, so our farming will be hurt overall.  Some countries will become wetter and some drier.  Any country as enormous as the US (let alone Russia) will inevitably get more rainfall overall.  We may be hurting for water in the areas we farm, but our total freshwater in lakes/rivers will increase.  Invading Canada will not be any more necessary than it is today.</text>
