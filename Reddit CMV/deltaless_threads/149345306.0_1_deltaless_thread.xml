    <title>CMV: It's a good idea for bank tellers to be armed.</title>
    <original_poster>ImAwesomeLMAO</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm not entirely passionate about second amendment rights, but it just seems like a rational solution to the problem of an armed robber coming in every now and then. This won't help with any nonviolent thieves that use sneaking, hacking or bad checks, but mostly just to protect the customers and the employees themselves.

Assuming the employees are at least a little trustworthy, there's nothing to worry about. 

This isn't something I've done more than some Googling on, but it just occurred to me. Happy Friday guys.</original_post>

    <text>Being asked to use force against robbers would make bank tellers jobs far more dangerous. So be prepared to pay them much more.  The higher costs of tellers are going to reduce bank profits and raise costs to depositors. So prepare for a significant rise in banking costs followed by a reduction in use of banking services following the law of demand.  Less banking means a contraction in lending and borrowing, which ultimately raises borrowing costs and reduces investment.  Less investment slows economic growth while the reduction in bank deposits contracts the money supply (M2). The drop in prices from the contraction sends us into a recession while less loans mean a reduction in investment. So output growth slows as does our aggregate income.  So your plan just crashed the world economy. How does that make you feel?</text>
