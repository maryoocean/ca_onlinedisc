    <title>CMV: It's stupid to care about the environment in space.</title>
    <original_poster>MostRecommendation84</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm a big proponent of space colonization/exploitation and every time I bring it up there's someone who says something along the lines of "Oh we're gonna trash the Moon like we did Earth?" "Oh good more mining!" "Humanity won't rest until we've exploited everything we can!" and other snide comments to that effect. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Honestly, it just sounds like the dumbest argument to me and I wouldn't even be bothering with a CMV if I hadn't heard it so many times. *It's rocks. Uninhabitable barren rocks floating through vast chunks of literally* ***nothing****.* There's no space squirrels to worry about, we haven't found any aliens and we really have no reason to assume any are out there, let alone that they give a shit what we do to Mercury. Furthermore, you want to stop desertification or the human rights violations of cobalt mining, you're gonna be hard pressed to find a better solution than the absurd volumes of water and cobalt from here to the asteroid belt.</original_post>

    <text>You are assuming space has no life. If that's the case, I don't care if you trash the moon or not. 

The problem is that humanity will never stop until we've exploited everything we can. And that is true. Hear me out.

If we get to a point in our civilization where we can easily travel throughout space, and visit other worlds with life in them. How do you think life in those planets will be? Most likely not intelligent life, if anything, it will be something similar to plants, bacteria, trees, animals. 

What do you think humans will do with those plants? Eat them. With those animals? Hunt them. With those trees? Cut them down.

Why? Because don't you think it would be awesome to have an extraterrestrial wooden desk? Or go to a fancy restaurant and dine streak from some weird cow from outer space? 

The problem doesn't stop there. Humans will exploit these planets for natural resources, massive scale agriculture, and farming. 

We won't stop until those planets are destroyed by us. That is exactly what we're doing to our own planet. We are not stopping and we will not stop until it is destroyed. Why? Because we like the taste of bacon, go faster, and just the right right temperature in our homes.

Disgusting.</text>
