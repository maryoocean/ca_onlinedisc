    <title>CMV: It is illogical to not believe in Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>LAMARR__44</original_poster>
    <original_post>Many people either believe in Hard Determinism or Compatibilism. I will argue that both are illogical.

Both argue that human actions are extensions of factors we do not have a choice over. Compatibilism seems to say we are still free but just redefines free will to the internal factors behind a decision, but the decision is still decided by a chain of events outside of our control.

My argument is a sort of wager argument. Either libertarian free will exists or it doesn’t. If it exists and we believe in it, we have made a free decision where we are right. If libertarian free will doesn’t exist, the decision to believe in libertarian free will was out of our control.

So either we have a choice and we can make the right choice, or we don’t have a choice and were determined to be wrong.

Thus it makes more sense to believe in libertarian free will since it’s potentially the only one where we have a chance to make a right choice, if determinism is true there is no choice, so there’s no value in being right.</original_post>

    <text>Your argument is illogical because it is a question begging fallacy assuming that libertarian free will is a better choice.

In reality it's irrelevant. Is your brain/mind making choices that do not depend on the physical state of the universe and itself? That would disprove materialism or causality, and we'd need to go back to the drawing board, but it wouldn't be better or worse. It would simply "be" an outcome. Similarly if it turns out that you actions and choices are determined by the preexisting state of the universe and causally follow from it - but, so what? You still don't know how the decision was made and which components or exact energy transfers caused it. It is effectively unknown and therefore just as "free" to us as libertarian free will. 

A coin flip outcome is 100% determined by physical forces applied, velocity, air resistance, transfer of kinetic energy at the point of impact with a surface, so on and so forth. But because we as limited agents are unable to predict those and calculate them in advance, it is effectively random.</text>
