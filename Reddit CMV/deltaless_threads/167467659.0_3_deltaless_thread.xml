Almost none of his comics were actually relevant or topical in any way.  They were basically just shock-jock level of "oh hey look how insulting I can be, come at me bro."  If he hadn't just been killed by a terrorist, this was basically 4chan level of trolling. Not even that really. 

"I don't have a wife or children or credit" etc, sure that applies to him, but not the other people killed. And, frankly, his comics were awful, pure 100% trolling, but now they're "genius" because he's dead.</original_post>

    <text>He knew he was taking a risk by making and publishing his art.  Knowing this, he went ahead, and people killed him for what he wanted to say, draw and write.

Maybe his art wasn't that good, from a technical standpoint.  Maybe it wasn't all that funny.  Or, maybe some humor is lost in the translation.  Either way, he had the courage of his convictions and was willing to stand up to mortal peril to speak the message he wanted to.  This is a great example.</text>
