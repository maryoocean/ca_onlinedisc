    <title>CMV: If a business has two individual bathrooms, both should be unisex bathrooms</title>
    <original_poster>ricebasket</original_poster>
    <original_post>The bathrooms I'm describing are the ones where there's a single door and a small room with a toilet, sink, and trashcan that are used by one person at a time. I don't think there's any reason to divide them by gender. By equipment, they're identical I believe it's pretty uncommon for them to have urinals. Frequently the women's restroom will have a short line I have to wait in, while the men's stall is completely unoccupied. Occasionally I'll jump the line and use the men's restroom anyway, but people will give you strange looks. I've had men point out that they could not so easily do the same thing if there were a line at the men's room, and I think that's a really good point. If a business wants to provide a baby changing table, they could simply install one and mark it on the door avoiding the issue of either paying for two or only installing one in the women's room and leaving dads with infants out of luck. It's also beneficial to trans individuals who may feel uncomfortable using a gendered restroom.

I really can't think of any reason why this isn't more frequently seen. CMV!

Edit: Two counterpoints in response to common arguments:

1. From a management bathroom cleaning point of view, a unisex bathroom could be an advantage. Let's say a women's bathroom dirties by 10 dirt units every hour, the men's restroom by 8 dirt units every hour, and the restrooms are cleaned every 4 hours. That means you're more likely to get a customer complaint and have an employee need to go clean the women's room in hour 3, wasting some time. If you have unisex bathrooms it would even out and they each dirty at 9 units per hour, so it's easier to keep them both equally clean.

2. It doesn't make good business sense to have anyone tied up in a line. If there are 3 women waiting to pee and the men's stall is free, I don't want those women waiting around I want them browsing my store, paying the bill and freeing up a table, getting to their movie, etc. This argument also only favors men.

Edit 2: For all the talk of how terrifying women's bathrooms apparently are, I now feel like a hardened bad ass for using them all these years.</original_post>

    <text>The other day, I went into a CVS/Wallgreens type store with my GF and she really had to go; we got to the bathrooms and they had those pesky number/locks on them, and as I was in the hallway one employee was ducking away into the back room as I asked her what the bathroom situation was, she gave me a numerical key with #1234... which was for the male bathrooms.  I turn around and tell my honey as she fails on the woman's lock, I open the male's bathroom and let her in (and hope it's clean).

Effectively all bathrooms are Unisex if you want to use them that way, especially if they're one person bathrooms.  However the congestion would be sufficiently decreased in a large populated area with 2 unisex toilets private stalls, and then a bar-trough type situation for males who just want to pee in the center.  Something like an extended urinal with limited privacy and a washroom on exit, would keep 90% of men out of the unisex unless they had to go #2 and allow for those females to take their time with whatever happens in a girl's bathroom besides what it's intended for.

And can we stop calling them bathrooms if we don't bathe in them?  Or Restrooms because people don't rest in them, hopefully.  I like the term Water Closet, but that also implies it's small. :S</text>
