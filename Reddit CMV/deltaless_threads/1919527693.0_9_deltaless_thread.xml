    <title>CMV: Downfall of News Networks is a Good Thing</title>
    <original_poster>mindtug</original_poster>
    <original_post>News thrives off fear mongering which has been detrimental for America. For instance ‘stranger danger’ caused kids across America to be locked indoors which isn’t great for development and mental health because the fear of some van taking them away, while the likelihood of your kids being kidnapped is actually extremely low. Same thing with tough on crime that went overboard causing mass incarceration and lengthened prison times making America have the biggest prisoner poppulation in the world. News talk about “How we’re more divided than ever” but they’re probably the biggest contributors. It’s important to know what’s happening but global networks such as CNN and Fox are too sensational for me to support. Should I feel sad they’re dying?</original_post>

    <text>I liken the downfall of the networks to the downfall of Communism in the USSR.  Everybody cheered but the world immediately got 20x more complicated.

Same with the proliferation of Cable News.  Most Americans aren't sophisticated enough to understand the difference between Opinion and Hard News.  And yes, I'm an American. Nowadays you can go find a cable Opinion show that keeps you nice and cozy surrounding you with opinions you already agree with.  Echo Chamber.  You never have to take your head out.

People rarely have ideas.  Ideas have people.</text>
