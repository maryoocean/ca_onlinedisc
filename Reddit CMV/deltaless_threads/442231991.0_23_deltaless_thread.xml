    <title>CMV: Christianity is held together through fear</title>
    <original_poster>M1STER_B0NES</original_poster>
    <original_post>My opinion is that if the fear of going to Hell was not present in the Christian ideology, then most of the followers of the religion would not be there.

Before I decided I was agnostic, that was my only reason for continuing to identify with the religion. Then, I decided I wasn't going to let fear control me. 

All in all, I don't see how this is any different than blackmailing a person to do what you want. You present your instruction, then tell them how you will completely devastate their life if they do not follow through.</original_post>

    <text>As an agnostic atheist myself, the better argument against pascals wager is that there is as much chance of a god existing that exclusively rewards atheism as there is a chance of a god existing that exclusively punishes it. Pascals wager fails because whatever you believe in the supernatural, there is as much possibility of any belief or combination of beliefs fulfilling the standard for heaven or hell as there is for any other belief or combination of beliefs.

Christianity that threatens something of someone else certainly holds together that part but some of it is probably held together for people who explicitly don't believe in hell. Sure, many if not most forms of Christianity believe in hell, but a lot of individualized and probably some institutionalized forms do not believe in hell, and those forms of Christianity are not held together by fear. And since all a priori arguments for any form of Christianity are equally logically invalid , and all a posteriori arguments are as lacking in evidence of their occurrence and parsimoniousness in their explanation of reality, so good Christianity has no less of a basis to be convincing as bad Christianity. Of course, bad Christianity has no MORE of a basis to be convincing as good Christianity, and that is why I am fiercely secular in my demands for justifications of social behavior, because if there are no reasonable standards for logic and evidence as to why you ought to do something, then you can justify anything. But if you also share this expectation, then your Christianity is basically harmless to anyone but yourself, and it is a risk of personal harm that you ought to be allowed to take of your own volition. And if that personal belief does not include hell or purgatory, then it is not held together by fear, even if most/all others are.</text>
