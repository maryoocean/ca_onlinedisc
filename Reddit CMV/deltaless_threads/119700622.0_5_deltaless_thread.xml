    <title>A warmer earth will be better for humanity CMV</title>

    <original_post>Here are my basic thoughts laid out.

I'd rather live on the equator as compared to antartica.

A warmer earth will be caused by the trapping of heat which means that antartica should heat up faster than the equator as heat flows from the center of the earth and less goes into space.

So even if some land is overtaken by rising sea levels more land should be livable.


Now to be clear this is not an argument against attempting to slow down and eventually stop global warming.  My main argument is that today's temperature is not the best temperature and that the "best" temperature would be higher than it is today.</original_post>

    <text>Take a look at how much land mass would be lost with a mere 3m sea rise. That happens to encompass most of the population masses (coastal). And much of the productive farmland (river deltas). 
I for one do not want to experience massive population displacement and starvation. </text>
