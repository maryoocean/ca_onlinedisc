    <title>For the sciences, a master's degree is considered a failed phd. CMV.</title>

    <original_post>In the US, graduate science programs typically roll the master's degree into the phd program (ie, first 2 years is masters work, final 4 is phd). It is rare in the physics world, for example, to have a master's degree, as the jump typically goes from bachelor's to phd.

It's my view that in the professional world, people see master's degrees as failed phds and are worth as much. With the over-saturation of the job market by undergraduates, more and more employers are looking to those with graduate degrees for entry-level and internship-level positions. Yet, while a master's is technically considered a graduate degree, it is worthless for applying to graduate-level required education positions. This is because if an employer sets minimum requirements as a master's degree, that means a wide majority of those applying for the position will have phds.

Overseas in Europe, master's degrees in the sciences are more common, as they tend to be separate from the phd programs. In some cases, the master's degrees are rolled the opposite way into the undergraduate program, such that a 4 year undergrad program would include the master's courses and degree at the end. 

If a student from this background were applying for places that required minimum level master's degrees, they would be devalued by the flood of phds applying. On the other hand, if the master's degree holders were applying below their level, they would be cast aside from the fact that graduate-level degrees tend to demand higher wages than positions lower than that would support. Thus, for the sciences, a master's degree is too expensive for entry-level positions, yet too unqualified for positions at the graduate level, and thereby about as valuable as a failed phd.</original_post>

    <text>It's not uncommon for someone to acquire a Master's degree in a field related to the one in which they are getting a Ph.D. For instance, I have a Ph.D. in theoretical physics and, in addition to a Master's degree in physics, one in computer science. My wife has a Ph.D. in physics and a Master's in optics. In neither case is this regarded as a failed Ph.D., but rather as evidence of additional subject mastery. 

Many graduate departments also grant Master's degrees to those seeking teaching careers (junior colleges or high schools, e.g.) This is an entirely appropriate option and in no way reflects "failure" on the part of the recipient, a Ph.D. for a high school teacher being wholly unnecessary. 

In terms of academic requirements, my Master's degree in physics required completing the equivalent of two years of graduate coursework in physics and taking a comprehensive examination on this material, demonstrating subject mastery. It was the hardest year of coursework in my life. Afterward, I had plenty of job offers from defense contractors, investment houses, and software firms before I'd completed my Ph.D. While this was 20 years ago and things may have changed since, it is inconsistent with your thesis, that only one with a Ph.D. need apply. 

(Sure, I wouldn't land a job as a professional scientist and none of these jobs were for that, but then only a modest fraction of those getting a Ph.D. in science actually end up working as professional scientists...)</text>
