    <text>He means Australia, judging by the reference to  Bennelong. 

Australia is a particularly unusual example, as for some reason although there was some trade with Polynesians and Malays, there was very little adoption of technologies and ideas from abroad. Some of that might be explained by the difficulties of mining in monsoonal areas, and it is widely known that Tasmanians became more primitive after the island separated from the mainland, but that doesn't explain everything.</text>
