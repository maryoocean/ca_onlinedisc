    <title>CMV: Hillary Clinton is unfit for presidency.</title>
    <original_poster>Professorjack88</original_poster>
    <original_post>I believe that Hillary Clinton is unfit for the presidency because she is corrupt, a liar, and a hypocrite.

1. Hillary Clinton is corrupt. She or her husband routinely [have taken money from companies](http://downtrend.com/robertgehl/oops-bill-clinton-says-he-accidentally-took-500000-from-algeria-during-key-arms-negotiation-with-state-department), that they then go on to give government contracts. [One of her largest donors was given a spot on the nuclear advisory board, with no experience at all.](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/clinton-had-donor-as-nuclear-security-adviser.html) She will not release her speech transcripts, which hints at the fact that Hillary may have told them something that she doesn't want to get out. Whether it be corruption or something else; she is hiding something.



2. Hillary Clinton is a hypocrite and a liar. She takes huge sums of cash from wall street, and then says that she is going to breakup the banks. She says that she is a women's rights activist, and yet takes millions from countries like Saudi Arabia. I haven't even mentioned Hillary's flip flopping on all sorts of her campaign issues, and described in [this](http://imgur.com/Ls3B6n1) image. You can see her whole platform change in response to Bernie Sanders. She seems to say anything to get elected.

Based on all this, how can people support her? The facts are right there, and yet Hillary continues to get many votes. Is there something that I'm missing? It seems as if the second she gets in office she will support the big donors that she has pledged against. Throughout this whole thing, I haven't yet talked about Hillary's email scandal. She held secret government files on a server that was *hacked multiple times.* If someone could show me the reasons to support Hillary that would be great.

    <text>I can't argue that she isn't corrupt, but that doesn't necessarily make her unfit for presidency. In fact, it's kind of been the name of the game for decades now.

I can't argue that she isn't a hypocrite and/or liar, but how many politicians out there aren't hypocritical and/or never lied? There's not a President of the United States in history who has done everything promised and not changed policies based on the realities of the day.

Why is she fit for Presidency? Because she's been studying and participating in politics since 1965. She's played roles at both the state and national level. She's got more than enough experience to be President.

That said... will she be a good President? Who knows. That's up to a country full of mostly uninformed opinions.

Let's put this in perspective, though, which is in comparison to her opponent. Is Donald Trump corrupt? Hell yes. He's tied to scams to rob people of their money. Is he a hypocrite and a liar? Finding two contradictory statements by Trump is easier than finding a grain of sand in the desert. Does he have the credentials to be President? No. He's got no experience.

So... is Clinton fit? Credential-wise? Yes. Morality-wise? No.

My two cents. Doubt I actually change anyone's view with this, but there it is. Hope your vote counts. :)

(I said that last thing because there's a whole other level of corruption that goes beyond individuals.)</text>
