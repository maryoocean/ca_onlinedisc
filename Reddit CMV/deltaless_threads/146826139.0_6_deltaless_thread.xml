    <title>CMV: US Alcohol taxes should be higher.</title>
    <original_poster>huadpe</original_poster>
    <original_post>Currently alcohol taxes in the US are not very high.  I think given the social costs of drinking, particularly drunk driving and alcoholism, we would be better off raising them to better compensate for those costs, as a [pigouvian tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax).  We could lower other taxes to compensate, or not.  My view is not about the optimal level of overall taxation.

**The Numbers**

I'm going to just use hard liquor numbers because it's easier to get the tax rate per unit of ethanol.

Federally, a proof gallon is taxed [$13.50](http://www.ttb.gov/tax_audit/atftaxes.shtml), which equates to $27 per gallon of pure ethanol for human consumption.  At 0.6 fl oz per standard drink and 128 fl oz per gallon, that's about 12.6 cents per drink.  [State taxes](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=349) vary, but  on the whole bring it up to maybe 16 to 20 cents per drink.

[This study](http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797\(11\)00538-1/fulltext) ascribes a very high economic cost to alcohol consumption, and particularly to rapid consumption.  I don't know if their economic cost numbers are fully accurate, but it seems to support the hypothesis that there is a large cost, and that the cost comes in particular from people who consume a lot of alcohol.

So why shouldn't the total tax on alcohol go up to something like $100 per gallon of ethanol?

    <text>From an Economic standpoint, this is a fairly dangerous theory. There is an old saying that I use all the time: "The devil you know beats the devil you don't, and I like the devil I've got". I'll explain:

In Macroeconomics there is principle called "The Law of Unintended Consequences", it basically states that no matter how well thought out an action, there is always the potential for unforeseen variables to emerge. For example: 

&amp;amp;nbsp;

A State gives tax incentives for people who buy and drive electric vehicles in order to help fight pollution. As a result sales skyrocket but, as an unintended consequence, revenue from fuel taxes plummets.   

&amp;amp;nbsp;

We also have a simple principle: "The more you tax something, the less of it you get". If you increase the tax on Alcohol, then yes, you will reduce that behavior, and as a result, the costs associated with it. That in no way means that the resulting savings (which will still be with the consumer) will be put to a positive, or ever less destructive use. Taxing as a form of behavior modification, is rarely the answer.</text>

    <text>I'm quite familiar with economic theory.  A large point of the idea of a pigovian tax is that I would rather tax drinking than labor at the margin.  If we raised alcohol taxes, we could cut something like the payroll tax and still have the same revenue.  This fits nicely with the downward sloping demand curve and upward sloping supply curve for both alcohol and labor.</text>
