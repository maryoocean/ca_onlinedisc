    <title>CMV: Rap Music Sucks</title>
    <original_poster>chronicallyfailed</original_poster>
    <original_post>So it may just be that all the rap I've listened too has been bad, but I really can't think of a rap song or a song featuring rapping that isn't just unlistenably bad. 

The lyrics, even when they're not breathtakingly sexist and homophobic, tend to be boring, unimaginative crap along the lines of "my penis is big and I do drugs" - not that I have anything against songs about penises and drugs, just the way it seems to be done in rap that I've heard is just boastful and repetetive.

Musically, I just hear incessant, grating melodies played over a shitty drumbeat while someone talks over the top of it. A lot of the time I don't really see how it qualifies as music.

Also, the amount of ridiculous, pretentious crap in the music videos just makes it hard for me to take them seriously at all.

But I don't really want to just dismiss rap music like that, so please explain to me how it's not shit, and examples of it not being shit would be nice too.

    <text>You don't have to like any genre of music but what you're describing is gangsta rap which hasn't been the popular style in awhile.

"I just needed time alone with my own thoughts/got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vaults/my childlike creative purity and honesty is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts/reality is catchin up with me/takin my inner child I'm fightin for custody/with these responsibilities that they entrust in me/as I look down on my diamond encrusted piece thinkin.... No one man should have all that power"

That's Kanye's song Power, one of his most popular songs. You don't have to like Kanye, you don't have to like rap, but you can't deny that those are not lyrics about "big dicks and money" or whatever. Kendrick Lamar raps about alcoholism, the fear he felt growing up in Compton, and depression. And it's not like these are underground rappers, Kanye and Kendrick are HUGE and influential. Dismissing all rap as bad and about meaningless subjects would be like saying there's never been a good country song because a lot of artists sing about trucks. </text>

    <text>See that sounds much better than the lyrics I've heard before. although Kanye's sheer prickishness makes it hard for me to like him. Will check out Kerndrick Lamar though, thanks.</text>

    <text>Again, you don't have to like Kanye but his talent is undeniable. He has an entire album (808s and Heartbreaks) about the death of his mother and his breakup with a long-term girlfriend. Through the Wire is an excellent song about his near-death experience in a car accident that's on his first album. 

Don't dismiss an entire genre because you don't like a subset of it.</text>
