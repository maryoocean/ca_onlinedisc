    <title>CMV:conservatism is just narrow-mindedness</title>
    <original_poster>bridget-9</original_poster>
    <original_post>Conservatism in its most basic form is just wanting things to stay the way things are. This means that instead of thinking about and analysing a new idea or solution to a problem, conservatives prefer to stick with the current way of doing something. This to me seems like they are not very willing to even consider new ideas even if they may be better than the current system/ tradition which is essentially just narrow-mindedness. Traditions are held as sacred and are therefore not compared fairly and rationally to new alternatives. Conversely, I don't think it's true that progressives want change for change's sake, but at least embrace change when they see a problem with the current system.

Edit: Deltas awarded, thanks guys- this gave me plenty to think about and I'm more convinced than I thought I would be tbh (maybe I suffer from being a little narrow-minded too).

    <text>Fiscal conservativism is different than social conservatism. 

So what kind of conservative are you talking about? I assume social.

Also are you talking about people who are motivated to be conservative by their religion? That would be completely different than someone who is an atheist and a conservative.

I'm fairly socially conservative and non-religous. I am pro gun, anti-government involvement in marriage, I believe in personal responsibility, I believe that government should provide limited and temporary assistance to those in need, and I think that the combination of casual sex and technology like Facebook results in the devaluation of people ( there's always another hookup/fb friend ) rather than meaningful relationships. 

I hold a lot of these beliefs for completely different reasons, but I'll elaborate my thinking here. People are the only thing that matter in the end. Pets are great, but check out /r/natureismetal to see how they'd behave in their base state. Legacy is amazing, but only if people are there to appreciate it. In the end we will only be judged by our fellow humans at our funerals and that will be that - so value your fellow man, but value yourself and don't let others use or abuse you.

I'm sure that's clear as mud, but I'm on mobile and my lunch is over.
