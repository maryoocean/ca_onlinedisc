    <title>CMV: Average men do not have a good chance of having sex with women.</title>
    <original_poster>fitness35754745</original_poster>
    <original_post>My lady friends husband has had a threesome before and they are looking into being able to do it again.

This guy is 6 foot 3.

For me I'm only average sized. 5 foot 9 which an average penis of 5.5 inches length and 4.8 inches girth. My looks are also average only too I would say. However I would say my personality is good towards friends, I've managed to get my lady friend to open up to me about talking about her sexual experiences so I must be doing something right. (No flirting just friends talking, I'm lucky to have a friend like her)

I'm super insecure about this and this has kept me from sleeping. I'm not exsactly worried about having threesomes or often sex, I just feel quite inferior for not.

Do average guys really have a chance with this type of thing? I cant help but feel this guys height (and possible above average penis size) is making women consider sleeping with him more. Do I have atleast a good chance? I believe I dont and that I'm at a very big disadvantage. 

I know from fair studies that the preferred penis size is bigger than average and I'm sure the preferred height for a man is above average too. I'm more worried about penis size because well, it can change the plessure the women recieves no matter good or bad.</original_post>

    <text>Think about what you said, "average men do not have a good chance"... let's assume attractiveness is a bell curve. Then the median = the average. So do you really think that 50% or more of men *never have sex?* That just can't be possible.

If you "look average," then it's entirely about your personality, behavior, and chemistry with other people. Even if someone was just looking for sex, not a relationship, they still want to be able to tell whether they'll have a good time with you or you'll be annoying/a dick to them. Looks make a first impression, but if a woman has enough information about your personality to make a judgment on you (good or bad) then your looks will be much less important in comparison.</text>
