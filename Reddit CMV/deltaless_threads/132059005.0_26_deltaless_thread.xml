    <title>CMV: I think masturbation is bad for you.</title>
    <original_poster>TextingWhileDriving</original_poster>
    <original_post>I used to be part of the /r/NoFap community and felt good about it. I had a sense of pride when a day passed without masturbation squeezed in there. However, I never went longer than 2 weeks without masturbating. Each time I masturbated I felt a sense of dread and depression, knowing I would just masturbate again sometime later. 

Today I broke my 4 day streak. I feel depressed and stressed. This basically confirms how I felt about masturbation in the beginning. It's bad for you. You could change my view with study's or from experience yourself. Go ahead and try changing my view. </original_post>

    <text>Your line of reasoning could be applied to a person who regularly smokes and tries to quit for a couple days and feels the withdrawal effects so they conclude NOT smoking is bad. Personal experience has shown me there is a certain period to kick a habit for a light addiction user (weed a few days, caffeine a week, sugar a couple weeks, alcohol several weeks) and I think masturbation has its own period. Thinking masturbation is bad/wrong will leave you depressed and stressed; acknowledging it is a very normal thing to do releases some depression and stress. I'd honestly recommend finding some better support for your opinion if you're going to avoid doing something that can relieve the bad things you're feeling.</text>
