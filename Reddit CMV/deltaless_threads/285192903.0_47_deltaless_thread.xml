    <title>CMV: Hillary Clinton is unfit for presidency.</title>
    <original_poster>Professorjack88</original_poster>
    <original_post>I believe that Hillary Clinton is unfit for the presidency because she is corrupt, a liar, and a hypocrite.

1. Hillary Clinton is corrupt. She or her husband routinely [have taken money from companies](http://downtrend.com/robertgehl/oops-bill-clinton-says-he-accidentally-took-500000-from-algeria-during-key-arms-negotiation-with-state-department), that they then go on to give government contracts. [One of her largest donors was given a spot on the nuclear advisory board, with no experience at all.](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/clinton-had-donor-as-nuclear-security-adviser.html) She will not release her speech transcripts, which hints at the fact that Hillary may have told them something that she doesn't want to get out. Whether it be corruption or something else; she is hiding something.



2. Hillary Clinton is a hypocrite and a liar. She takes huge sums of cash from wall street, and then says that she is going to breakup the banks. She says that she is a women's rights activist, and yet takes millions from countries like Saudi Arabia. I haven't even mentioned Hillary's flip flopping on all sorts of her campaign issues, and described in [this](http://imgur.com/Ls3B6n1) image. You can see her whole platform change in response to Bernie Sanders. She seems to say anything to get elected.

Based on all this, how can people support her? The facts are right there, and yet Hillary continues to get many votes. Is there something that I'm missing? It seems as if the second she gets in office she will support the big donors that she has pledged against. Throughout this whole thing, I haven't yet talked about Hillary's email scandal. She held secret government files on a server that was *hacked multiple times.* If someone could show me the reasons to support Hillary that would be great.

    <text>As far as mainstream politicians go, Hillary Clinton is among the most honest.  Here's a summary from www.politifact.com, a non-partisan, Pulitzer Prize winning organization which rates the truthfulness of politician's public statements.  Statements can range from: True, Mostly True, Half True, Mostly False, False, and Pants on fire.

* Clinton - 51% MT or better, 27% MF or worse
* Sanders - 52% MT or better, 29% MF or worse
* Obama - 48% MT or better, 25% MF or worse
* Trump - 9% MT or better, 77% MF or worse
* Cruz - 22% MT or better, 64% MF or worse
* Romney - 31% MT or better, 42% MF or worse
* Biden - 39% MT or better, 33% MF or worse
* McConnell - 39% MT or better, 46% MF or worse
* Reid - 36% MT or better, 51% MF or worse
* Ryan - 34% MT or better, 44% MF or worse
* Pelosi - 17% MT or better, 44% MF or worse

Clinton trails only Sanders by %1 in most truthful statements made and only Obama by 2% in least false statements made.  She is undoubtedly a career politician, and politicians may all inherently pander to voters, donors, etc.  However, to assert that she is somehow more dishonest or the most dishonest among national politicians is incorrect.  In fact the opposite is true.</text>

    <text>What determines what Politifact looks at, though? Hard to know what those percentages mean IMO.</text>

    <text>Politifact is owned and operated by the Tampa Bay Times which has endorsed Clinton for president. Hardly unbiased. There are numerous examples around where they have political slant. </text>
