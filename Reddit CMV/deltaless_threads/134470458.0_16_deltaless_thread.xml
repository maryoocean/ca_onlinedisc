    <title>CMV: I believe that woman's nipples should be censored despite men's not being so.</title>
    <original_poster>keanex</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've noticed that there seems to be a lot of people that are pro-women being able to go topless in the streets. I've thought about why it bothers me and why I find it inappropriate. The big thing that bothers me is that women's nipples are sexualized, unlike men's, when it comes to the average person's view on sex.

I believe that a woman will never be able to go topless without causing a stir unless women's boobs, and more importantly, their nipples are no longer considered objects of sex*.

*I couldn't think of a better way to put this. I'm not objectifying women, I'm stating that the body part in question plays a role during sex, like a man's penis.

    <text>So the thought is this: "Women's breasts need to be censored because they're sexualized." 

But really, it's all about perspective. Men's breasts are equally as sexualized, so why not say instead: "censor everyone's nipples."

Do I think everyone's nipples should be censored? No, and I'm against censorship in general. Everyone was born with nipples and no one is special because of that. We all look the same way nude, and there's nothing be be ashamed about.</text>
