    <title>CMV: it is a jerk move to play music while camping within earshot of other campers.</title>
    <original_poster>estheredna</original_poster>
    <original_post>We put a tent up in a state park campground for about 4 weeks out of the summer. Most of the time you can just hear nature, people talking, kids playing, lots of birds and squirrels  . Every 5th day or so, there is someone who brings some Bluetooth speakers so they can listen to music , but loud  enough  that people in a half dozen sites nearby get to ‘enjoy’ whatever they are playing. 

Right now I’m cooking dinner and the guys next to me are playing U2, Dave Matthew Band and similar inoffensive crap.

This would be entirely normal in a backyard gathering, but once you reserve to be in a public campground, it becomes selfish, intrusive,  rude.

Am I wrong?

(I know it’s a known risk of car camping. I’m not really  mad. More rolling my eyes. I wish they’d shut that crap off.  )

    <text>Campsites where there are many different places to camp within close proximity of one another are super common.</text>

    <text>Right but no ones forcing you to choose those. It’s a big world out there, plenty of places to camp where no one is around. If you choose to camp right next to other people, you should have the expectation that at some point they will annoy you. It’s the same as living in a subdivision or apartment complex - when you are in close proximity to other people, at some point they will annoy you with their noise. If you want to have nature all to yourself, just go seek it out. Not hard. </text>
