    <title>CMV: Companies accepting climate change is more dangerous than companies denying climate change.</title>
    <original_poster>4ofclubs</original_poster>
    <original_post>So I obviously believe in climate change, however I'm more in the camp of "It's too late so we need to act more drastically to prepare" than "we need nuclear power and electric cars to save us."

I see a trend lately that every company ever is advertising "Here at xyz we believe that we all need to do our part in climate change, that's why for every $100 spent we'll plant one tree!" and so on.

You can see it in examples of [greenwashing](https://www.offshore-technology.com/analysis/how-greenwashing-ads-can-be-terrible-for-the-environment/) everywhere.

Companies are realizing they can no longer accept that climate change isn't real, otherwise they will lose customers. They accept climate change is real, do the bare minimum by greenwashing their products, or even making actual efforts such as moving to [solar powered](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/28/10-massive-corporations-going-big-on-solar-power.html) production plants, [carbon-neutral plans](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209580992100429X) for countries like China, or even the a bigger consumer buy-in for [electric cars.](https://www.anl.gov/esia/light-duty-electric-drive-vehicles-monthly-sales-updates)

My point is that all this does is tell us that we can continue to grow and expand our economy and live life as is when there is a lot of [evidence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352550921002931) showing that carbon neutrality by 2050 with business as usual methods of growth in capitalism simply won't work. We need to scale down our production and way of living to even hit 2 degrees warming by [2030.](https://www.ipcc.ch/2022/04/04/ipcc-ar6-wgiii-pressrelease/) 

If these companies continued to deny climate change, most people would start to turn on them, and degrowth ideally would naturally follow. Instead, we follow along blindly because the masses have been told that solar panels will save us and we don't need a larger focus on public transit, less consumption of meat, etc.

TLDR: Companies are greenwashing by saying we can live life as is with electric cars, solar panels, and recycling while continuing to grow under a capitalist system, when in reality the only way to reverse climate change is by reducing our intake, staying local with food production, and overall reducing the way the west consumes.</original_post>

    <text>I think you need to come to terms with the reality of the situation. We can't solve this in any way that's currently being proposed. We might not be able to solve it at all for that matter. In any case, it's counter productive to incur great cost on the mere *hope* that it might do something good. It's better to focus on prosperity (which is what makes people like you care about the climate in the first place) and then we'll be in a better position to deal with whatever is coming our way. 

The problem with that approach is that it denies so many people the purpose of being "heroic activists" for a great cause. Sorry about that.</text>

    <text>Let me get this straight: You agree with my first paragraph but because I said something mean in the second, that renders the first invalid? 

And ironically the second paragraph is also factually correct. That it upsets you suggests to me that you seem to identify yourself as one of those people. If that's the case, then perhaps consider this: It's not heroic if you only *appear* to be saving the world by demanding others pay for your ideas at the cost of making more people poor (and increasing famine incidentally). I know it's *easy* that way but easy isn't how life works.</text>
