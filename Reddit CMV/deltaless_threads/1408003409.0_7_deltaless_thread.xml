    <title>CMV: Average men do not have a good chance of having sex with women.</title>
    <original_poster>fitness35754745</original_poster>
    <original_post>My lady friends husband has had a threesome before and they are looking into being able to do it again.

This guy is 6 foot 3.

For me I'm only average sized. 5 foot 9 which an average penis of 5.5 inches length and 4.8 inches girth. My looks are also average only too I would say. However I would say my personality is good towards friends, I've managed to get my lady friend to open up to me about talking about her sexual experiences so I must be doing something right. (No flirting just friends talking, I'm lucky to have a friend like her)

I'm super insecure about this and this has kept me from sleeping. I'm not exsactly worried about having threesomes or often sex, I just feel quite inferior for not.

Do average guys really have a chance with this type of thing? I cant help but feel this guys height (and possible above average penis size) is making women consider sleeping with him more. Do I have atleast a good chance? I believe I dont and that I'm at a very big disadvantage. 

I know from fair studies that the preferred penis size is bigger than average and I'm sure the preferred height for a man is above average too. I'm more worried about penis size because well, it can change the plessure the women recieves no matter good or bad.</original_post>

'#nonsequitur

Threesomes aren't all they're cracked up to be, dude.  If that's your Holy Grail, your religion is wrong.

&amp;gt;For me I'm only average sized. 5 foot 9

I'm 5' 7" with a nice long sleep to extend the spine.  I've been sexually active almost constantly for going on two decades.

&amp;gt;However I would say my personality is good

You led your self-description with height, dick size and looks - that suggests your personality might not be as developed as you think it is.

&amp;gt;I cant help but feel this guys height (and possible above average penis size) is making women consider sleeping with him more.

Oh it definitely is.  There are *at least* hundreds of millions of men who would be more attractive than you even if you were a foot taller and had a bigger dick.  Being the best was never in the cards, so just give up on that.

To be blunt: the only solution is to stop feeling sorry for yourself.  The world is what it is.  You can try until you succeed or you can spend all your time preoccupied with potential failure and wallow in self pity until visions of failure become self-fulfilling prophecies.

Can you change your height? No.

Can you change your dick? No.

Accept the things you can't change and move on.  Anything else is a waste of precious time.</text>

    <text>Oof those are some hard words to swallow.

So would you say that my chances are definitely lower because the way I was born?</text>

    <text>Lower than some other guys'?  Absolutely.

But "lower" isn't zero - it isn't even 50%.  Your chances are very good if you have realistic expectations and stop comparing yourself to every guy you meet.</text>
