    <title>CMV: Life is meaningless, and there's no point to trying to prolong it as much as possible.</title>
    <original_poster>ragdala</original_poster>
    <original_post>Whatever we do, ultimately, has no meaning. In the grand scheme of things, we are but a tiny speck of dust on a meaningless planet.

That's why i say that trying to prolong life is absolutely useless. This includes tries to reanimate dying people, trying to find a special formula for immortality, and similar medical/engineering advances.

Instead of finding ways to prolong life, we could better spend resources to make the life we've got more pleasurable. This would be a much better way to spend our time and resources, by actively trying to become a better and happier society, where death is just part of the cycle, with no taboos attached to it.</original_post>

    <text>By saying that life is meaningless, you're missing the fact that you're adding meaning to that life has no meaning. It's meaningless **and** it's meaningless that it's meaningless. Your opposition to prolonging life comes from your adding meaning to the fact that life has no meaning. Your opinions about how to allocate resources, about how society could or should be, and about taboos related to death -- all of those are additional meaning that **you've added** to life.</text>
