    <title>CMV: Alpha males are actually 95 percent beta</title>

    <original_post>The others are human traffickers internet celebrities.  
I really don't believe this bullshit. I made a lot of observations in the military and people don't fit these patterns. The reason I'm writing this is because they contradict what they made up. they're all going after a few "alphas". but speaking by their rules, one alpha never follows another alpha. For example, andrew tat. This guy has millions of followers. most of them are men. others are probably female simps. now, if they are all alpha then what are all these alphas doing together? Why are alphas praising or defending andrew tate on the internet? All I see is adolescents who have not become individuals, have chosen a "male" role model for themselves from the internet. or, in their language, the alpha male gathered all betas around him.  
 just it. speaking by the book, an alpha never follows another alpha, when an alpha sees another alpha, he prepares for a fight. there is only one alpha in a group, there is no such thing as an assistant alpha. There are only loyal betas who take advantage of alpha. But, as far as I can see, these aren't even beta. fanboys only.  
Another contradiction (paradox?) "sigmas". I'll cut it short. why would a sigma have discussions with anonymous people on the internet about being sigma?   
Imagine that: Kai, the most famous sigma (who is a beyblade character, not kpop) is watching videos of the his sigma brothers to be cool (or make a girl). do you think this makes sense?</original_post>

    <text>I hate when people bring up that stupid wolf study, we mapped on a REAL phenomenon onto a description of wolves. Just because the description is false, doesn't mean the phenomenon is false. It just means the mapping is less accurate.

Now true alphas might be a myth, an idealized concept, but the real descriptors we assign alphas certainly exist. Leadership, charisma, courage, strength, assertiveness, are you going to try and say there aren't men that exist that have all these qualities? You might wanna say there's no one that has all these qualities in a perfect blend and the perfect amount but we don't need it to be the perfect alpha.</text>
