    <original_post>I'm sorry but as an artist and painter it grinds my gears when I see all these tik toks with artist wasting paint. I understand splatter painting to a degree. A few droplets aren't going to kill anybody but when it is just people throwing paint cans and it ect it's ridiculous. It's pretentious and honestly your not really making art. Your making just a mess and it's incredibly wasteful. 

In the age of environmental destruction paint is one of the worst and most toxic things you can emit into the world. There's been multiple articles and studies on how it facilitates climate change and all manner of other issues! If you're going to use a resource like paint use it efficiently!

If you don't you're kind of an ass.

    <text>but it wasn't a waste of paint.  the paint made the performance which is part of the work of art.

Let's give a rough estimate and say she used 10 gallons of paint for this project.  some of the sloshes of paint were clearly watered down which makes it splash more and look like far more paint than it was.

Now if a drama club put on a play, they too could easily use 10 gallons of paint on the set pieces for a quite low budget limited set production.  

This person's video has 3.2 million likes.  it will have far more man-hours of enjoyment seeing it than that local drama club play, and that drama club could have done their play with no set pieces, or simply used white sheets and projected backdrops, or some other option.  but I am assuming you are far more mad at this woman for splashing paint around than people painting an equal amount on backdrops.

what about people that repaint the walls of their homes just to have a new color, or apartment landlords that repaint the walls because it is quicker and easier than cleaning and spot touching up the walls between tennants.  

This person is using every bit of this paint as part of their art. none of it is going to waste any more than someone who painted a 5ft x 5ft piece wasted paint because they could have painted a 1ft by 1ft piece.</text>

    <text>Just because you don't like the end result doesn't mean you get to deem it a waste.

You don't know the brands of paint they're using or what their income goes towards.</text>
