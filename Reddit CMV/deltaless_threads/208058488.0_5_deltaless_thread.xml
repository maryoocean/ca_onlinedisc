    <title>CMV: I don't like tipping.</title>
    <original_poster>litle5o</original_poster>
    <original_post>Leaving a tip feels so customary in certain places that it's become an incentive to do your job properly. I understand that it's the service that they provide and not just the food, but isn't that exactly what they're paid for? To give a paying customer a good service? Although I sympathize with their outrageously low wages, but why should I have to fork out more of my money that I'm already spending at a restaurant to subsidize young Jenny here, to get her up to normal living wage? Isn't that a governmental issue of poverty/low wages?</original_post>

    <text>Yes, the service is what they are paid for, but mostly, the people paying them are you and the other customers. The restaurant pays them like $2/hr I'm pretty sure. You basically hire them.

I like paying a server directly. I think in general, it helps servers make more money than they otherwise would (if they get lots of customers). If tipping went away I would probably end up paying about the same amount of money for food, it would just shift to the owner/corporation instead of the servers.</text>

    <text>In the US, at least, if an employee receives less than minimum wage AFTER tips, the employer must make up the difference.  So, you and the other customers are basically subsidizing the employer's labor costs.</text>

    <text>I would imagine if they actually had to do this often, prices would go up.

I would also imagine that server who doesn't get enough tips is soon replaced by one who does.</text>

    <text>You're probably right on both counts.  I also suspect that if this happened to any server regularly, he/she would probably quit and find another job -- waiting tables is too hard of work to only be earning minimum.</text>
