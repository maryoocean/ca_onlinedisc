    <title>CMV: Saying white people in general shouldn't feel guilty for the actions of specific, individual white people isn't an example of white fragility.</title>
    <original_poster>LucidMetal</original_poster>
    <original_post>I was recently banned from /whitepeopletwitter for this comment:

&amp;gt;I don't think "white people" need to feel guilty about this. You're just internalizing an issue over which you don't have control. What we need to do is figure out a way to combat the revisionist history narratives and misinformation that are plaguing conservative spheres (I don't want to say "echo chamber" because let's be honest everyone lives in an echo chamber these days).

I don't care that I was banned to be clear. I do care that the reason seemed incorrect. The reason given was:

&amp;gt;White fragility is racist.

I do believe "white fragility" as a concept exists in America i.e. many white people exhibit a negative reaction including anger, fear, guilt, arguing, silence, or leaving the stress-inducing situation when they encounter discussions of race. I have no idea how pervasive it is because I don't encounter it very frequently but I have encountered it and I know my friends who belong to minority racial groups say it happens frequently for them. 

I don't think the ban was justified (but who cares) and I don't think white fragility is racism (I suppose easy delta here if you can show me why) but I also don't see why my comment is an example of white fragility.

As far as I remember it's the opposite! It was saying OP should not feel guilt when discussing the Buffalo shooter since it was a specific person with a specific worldview not "white people". I can't post the comment I was responding to because it's been deleted but it was along the lines of "white people should feel guilty for the Buffalo shooter".

EDIT: Alright, found the parent using Unddit! This is what I was responding to:

&amp;gt;“My kids shouldn’t feel guilty for slavery two hundred years ago!”

&amp;gt;News flash asshole, they should feel guilty for what happened in the past week.</original_post>

    <text>I really don't understand why you were band. The guy was covered in body armor  and probably would have been shot otherwise nothing to feel guilty over. Is it sad yes but sympthazing and guilt are two different things. No one of any race really owes their race anything. It's just weird way of thinking. You seem genuine on your comment and don't come across like you're dismissing that the dude was a racist nutjob. 

The problem with the U.S. We have too much immigration and individuals don't know their history and taking narratives that have nothing to do with their family history. A lot of the White Americans I come across immigrated during the World Wars and had nothing to do with slavery or much of U.S. history.  Same with some African Americans some aren't descendants of slaves in the U.S.  Majortiy of African Americans are related to their ancestors slave owners. They can just take a DNA test to try to squash that beef and just scream at their white relatives. Expecting all white people to be responsible and care for each other because of race is hilarious. Europeans have constantly been at war with each other.Tribalism is beyond race and racism is just a small byproduct of it.</text>
