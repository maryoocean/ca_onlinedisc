    <title>I find that atheists are devoid of compassion for humanity. CMV</title>

    <original_post>When I was a Christian, I found there were assholes mostly but there also seemed to be a profound desire to do good. And when it did happen, it was so fucking relieving. 

I have been an agnostic for some time now. But I feel that people are not very compassionate. They are judgment and form emotional cliques. So their entire moral compass is based on protecting these loved ones and attacking those who 'step out of line?' On top of that, many atheists that I have met are often pretty petty about their ideas and, if something sounds slightly off or 'wrong', they try and shut you down immediately instead of listening. They seem to be completely legalistic.

Is there an humanist or atheist 'philosophy' out there that promote compassion for other people?</original_post>

    <text>There are awful people everywhere, regardless of what religion are you. I mean, theoretically, all religions tend to oppose violence. Yet we have Muslims (Al-Qaeda and Taliban) and Christians (IRA in Ireland) who are terrorists. They have no compassion for human life whatsoever and yet they are religious. Perhaps atheists are devoid of compassion for humanity, but if so it is only because everyone is.</text>
