    <title>CMV: Muslim is the superior ideology</title>
    <original_poster>eltrutekili</original_poster>
    <original_post>First off I need to preface this by saying that I am a straight white male who was born, baptized, and raised Christian. I've held various thoughts throughout my life, ones you could even consider "Islamophobic".

That being said, I've read and watched a lot of content on the internet about the supposed "decline of Western civilization". Basically, it is the concept that feminism and white displacement is causing the downfall of society. This is due to a variety of factors, not limited to but including single motherhood, promiscuity, and drug abuse.

One of the major side effects of such societal issues is the formation of niche, extremist groups such as incels and MGTOWs. I'm not saying MGTOW = incel, but their core foundations are rooted upon the same premise; pure frustration.

Now here's the kicker, everything I am mentioning is fully solved within majority Muslim populations.

Allow me to explain. I thought about this a while back and was reminded of it tonight. I had just finished watching the UFC fight (Dustin Poirier vs. Khabib Nurmagomedov), and was reminded of Dustin's last fight. After Dustin's last fight, his wife graced the stage to show support for her husband. I just need to say, this woman was wearing an open cut dress showing off her...how shall I put it..."melons".

I got curious, being the testosterone driven young man that I am. I Googled her and found her Instagram. Her Instagram is filled with photos of her wearing very little clothing and receiving a lot of male attention. One comment, however, caught me off guard. It was written by a Muslim who had pointed out that Dustin allows his wife to post all of these sexual photos for attention, but nobody has ever even seen Khabib's wife. Well, you can find pictures of his wedding, but she is in full garment covering everything including her face. This individual then said that this is how it should be, that Khabib is the only man to see her half naked, and you know what? I agree.

Now about my previous statement; the majority Muslim populations solving issues which can be attributed to the "downfall" of our society. Muslims have, for a long time, enforced very strict rules which attempt to not only subdue but control biological urges that are rooted in hedonism, deprivation, and outright evil.

For example, I mentioned incels. Well, arranged marriages not only remove the societal pressure of having to find and court a woman. It also ensures that both parties are pure, and their pair boding has not been demolished by one night stands and "hypergamy". Not to mention removing a lot of the social anxieties around said relationships.

MGTOW? Most of them ended up in this boat because they were completely fucked over by the family court system, or "divorce rape" as they call it. Yeah, divorce isn't a thing in Muslim countries. Once you're married you're married. Cheat on your wife/husband? You're in for hell.

One more note; I also mentioned drug abuse. I watched a Vice documentary on ISIS which followed actual Islamic State militants in order to see how they run things in the various small areas they control. They were riding with one of the leaders through a town. One thing I noticed was that they had stopped to check on a man who was just released from prison for...get this...drinking alcohol. They made sure he was alright and that he was not drinking. They checked his place and everything.

You might be thinking, "this is anti-freedom!", and you might be partially correct. However, I believe this is more a matter of principal. Do you discipline this man for doing something that will clearly destroy him and cause harm to those around him, or do you let him be "free", drink until he has liver damage, and get into violent altercations while intoxicated? 99/100 times I'm going with the former.

Here is where the Muslim superiority really starts kicking in. If you look at major institutions, companies, schools, etc. They all seem to be towing this social justice warrior narrative lately. White males are at the brunt of most accusations, and are being made to feel guilty about all types of things. Things like slavery, patriarchy, etc. It seems weird to me that a white supremacist patriarchal society would allow this type of thing to happen.

The funny part; Muslims have a solution for this too. It's actually quite ironic. All of these different forms of oppression are far more prevalent in these Muslim countries, but you never hear about it from SJWs. Quite the opposite, actually. This label of "Islamophobia" seems to be some type of bizarre shield against any criticism one might have of said cultures.

Which is another point; Muslims would never take this kind of shit. They have their culture locked down so hard that the mere idea of even being criticized by the very people who claim to be oppressed by patriarchy, despite the fact that the Muslim culture is extremely patriarchal, actually causes feminists to rear their heads in defense of said culture. It gets to the point where they even claim that forced garments are "empowering" to women.

That's the thing though. While these women are forced to wear this apparel, there's one thing that is certain; they will never be accused of being raped because of what they are wearing. This is my final point. They've effectively removed male biological urges by forcing the women to cover themselves. This minimizes women being looked at as nothing more than sex objects, and also ensures that their husbands are the only ones who have a truly intimate and unique connection with them.

It is for these reasons listed above that I believe that the Muslim ideology and culture is superior to all others. CMV.</original_post>

    <text>Oh my God, where do I even start??? As a Muslim, I cannot tell you how utterly offended I am by all that you have said.

&amp;gt;For example, I mentioned incels. Well, arranged marriages not only remove the societal pressure of having to find and court a woman. It also ensures that both parties are pure, and their pair boding has not been demolished by one night stands and "hypergamy". Not to mention removing a lot of the social anxieties around said relationships. 

Your definition of arranged marriages and ours are very different. For 1, a man proposing required BOTH the girls consent and the parents'. Meaning that if the parents want it to happen but the girl says no, they cannot get married, this is a haram marriage, an unlawful marriage, in the eyes of Islam. Trust me, the social anxieties around relationships still very much exist whether you're hitting on a girl to get a first date, or trying to make a good impression to get a proposal acceptance. The notion of future marriages being determined beforehand, the way you define an arrange marriage, is not allowed. One may suggest to their daughter/son 'we are thinking \_\_\_ will be a god fit for you, let's go meet them, and talk about a union', If either of the kid does not want to get married to that person, everything is cancelled. Shows over. Move on. 

Abstinence is the best way to protect yourself from STDs and intercourse with another person whom has never had intercourse is OFC a guarantee that your health is safe. Other things, like cervical cancer, are known to increase risk in occurring as you increase the number of different sexual partners you have, which is why, despite whatever other health concerns you see out there, sexual related ailments are a lot rarer inn Muslim countries. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but statistically less likely to occur.

&amp;gt; MGTOW? Most of them ended up in this boat because they were completely fucked over by the family court system, or "divorce rape" as they call it. Yeah, divorce isn't a thing in Muslim countries. Once you're married you're married. Cheat on your wife/husband? You're in for hell. 

Oh wow. You are so wrong its actually amusing. Christianity was the one who's been opposed to divorces. Islam has no notion of married until death, not even in the very early beginning of Islam. And divorce is definitely a thing in Muslim countries. Wanna know why? Because Islam has TWO different types of divorces that a marriage can go through depending on the circumstance. And not only is divorce allowed, divorcees are are permitted to remarry again. If the Holy Prophet's wife Khadija was a divorcee when she married him, there is nothing wrong with  say Ahmad from across the street marrying a divorcee back then, or today. Cheating is wrong. And is totally an acceptable reason to break off any marriage. So you wouldn't be in for Hell, you'd go to the justice system and say you want to break it off. The only thing wrong with divorce is you should not use it as a threat against your spouse to get your way. And if a Muslim does do that, he is behaving unlawfully and his behavior is not acceptable.

&amp;gt; You might be thinking, "this is anti-freedom!", and you might be partially correct. However, I believe this is more a matter of principal. Do you discipline this man for doing something that will clearly destroy him and cause harm to those around him, or do you let him be "free", drink until he has liver damage, and get into violent altercations while intoxicated? 99/100 times I'm going with the former. 

Yes, we prohibit any addictive substance that has the potential to easily cause harm to your lifestyle. That is why alcohol, narcotics and gambling are forbidden. One may argue to drink in moderation, but if it was so easy to keep oneself in check, alcoholics and rehab would not be so rampant in society. Similar to gambling - we hear all these things saying 'gamble responsibly', 'drink responsibly', the reason is, the dopamine high that we get from these actions is very, very addictive, and it is not easy to keep oneself in check. Gambling addiction is serious, not because it has any affect on your health, but because it is very easy to gamble away your savings, which causes a huge detriment to your life and your lifestyle. Drinking, not only dis-inhibits you to the point where you may not have any recollection of the night prior, long term drinking also has huge impacts on the liver, as you said. So credit where credit is due.

&amp;gt;If you look at major institutions, companies, schools, etc. They all seem to be towing this social justice warrior narrative lately. White males are at the brunt of most accusations, and are being made to feel guilty about all types of things.

This label of "Islamophobia" seems to be some type of bizarre shield against any criticism one might have of said cultures.

Islam indeed believes in some form of gender roles, a husband and wife have rights and responsibilities towards each other. However, the patriarchal society that you are thinking of, not so much the case. Firstly that 'patriarchal Muslim society' you talk about differs from culture to culture, because, surely you don't believe that all Muslims are from the same culture? Secondly, all those patriarchal social norms are separate from religion and differ between culture to culture and often extend to the non-Muslims citizens living there as well, because that is also their culture.

&amp;gt;you never hear about it from SJWs.

We don't need to hear about it from your white SJWs, we have our own people fighting for women's rights.

&amp;gt;All of these different forms of oppression are far more prevalent in these Muslim countries

Boy what are you on about? Slavery? If slavery exists that's not because 'Muslims' accept it, its because shitty governments still like to abuse power and guess what? That's also something that's been decreasing for AGES. Our SJW's are way on top of it, we don't need western help to come 'sort out our problems' Ya'll got the same shit happening and can barely figure it out yourselves, how do you think to solve our issues when you can't even fix your own yet. AND that being said, 'more prevalent in Muslim countries' could be possibly due to the fact that British invasions during the British empire and America's constant need to be present in the Middle East to instigate or continue war zones for the prospect of getting oil, might have toppled what semblance of balance had existed in those countries prior. When economies drop, people do more work for less, just to make some money, resulting in circumstances that abuse human rights. Is it right? No. Does Islam think its right, no. Do the people being exploited care? A bit, but not really, they're main focus is to make enough money to be able to eat and /or feed their kids at the end of the day.</text>

    <text>&amp;gt; This label of "Islamophobia" seems to be some type of bizarre shield against any criticism one might have of said cultures 

It is no shield. Primarily because the 'critiques' of cultures don't tie to religion, and Islamaphobia is the discrimination or hatred based on the RELIGION of Islam. Not the culture of whatever country you want to nitpick today. Islam has no culture. Culture has no involvement in the rulings of Islam. Culture may be defined through religion, but you cannot translate it back the other way.

&amp;gt; Muslim culture is extremely patriarchal, actually causes feminists to rear their heads in defense of said culture. It gets to the point where they even claim that forced garments are "empowering" to women. 

Firstly, forcing a women to wear anything is forbidden. You cannot, by the laws of the religion, dictate what a women ought to and ought not to wear. Islam has its guidelines on appropriate attire and enforces the notion of modesty, in both women AND men, however it is up to the individual, if they want to obey the religion or not in choosing their garments. These can be empowering. Often women say it makes them feel like they are being interacted with less as a 'woman' and more as a person. However, any human forcing a woman to wear something, whatever  it may be, covering or exposing, is not empowering and is not allowed. The choice to cover up  or not, has always been left with the woman. That is what is empowering. And for governments and societies to have taken that choice away from them, IS indeed a wrongdoing and is not seen as empowering. And this applies to both governments forcing the headscarf, and the Burka Ban. 

&amp;gt; They've effectively removed male biological urges by forcing the women to cover themselves. 

You sound so sexist right there. Men are 'forced' to cover up too.  And for the record. Not every Muslim girl wears the headscarf, or the burka or niqab. A huge part of 'covering up' is also what you feel comfortable showing. The restrictions upon men not looking at women lustfully are applied just the same on women. Women just don't bitch and moan about it.

Oh and one last thing:  **Muslim is the superior ideology** . Muslim is not an ideology. The word your looking for is Islam. Muslims are the people who follow the ideology. 

Get your head out of your butt, and stop trying to jump the bandwagon that 'Islam is regressive because of ...' to justify your own regressive opinions, and validate yourself. 

Islam does not agree with you. 

Educate yourself.</text>
