    <title>CMV: Christianity is held together through fear</title>
    <original_poster>M1STER_B0NES</original_poster>
    <original_post>My opinion is that if the fear of going to Hell was not present in the Christian ideology, then most of the followers of the religion would not be there.

Before I decided I was agnostic, that was my only reason for continuing to identify with the religion. Then, I decided I wasn't going to let fear control me. 

All in all, I don't see how this is any different than blackmailing a person to do what you want. You present your instruction, then tell them how you will completely devastate their life if they do not follow through.</original_post>

    <text>As is this case with most Christian targeted threads, this almost only applies to Evangelical American Christianity. I am Christian out of my own free will, and many Christians including myself do not believe in Eternal Hell. Additionally, the Early Church had all sorts of beliefs about Hell, and the Eternal model didn't become popular until St Augustine. The Church grew there not because of fear, but *despite* fear. 

I too was raised being scared into eternal Hell, but once I escaped Evangelical American right wing Christianity and now and completely free from any fear about my religion.</text>

    <text>Okay, that is probably why I am under that impression, as I am living in an Evangelical family.</text>

    <text>Yea, as myself and most of us at r/Christianity will acknowledge, American Evangelical Christianity has a lot of issues and has defected from a lot of Christian Truth. Many people under this sect fall away from Christianity by natural repulsion (the same thing happened to me), and few are as fortunate as me to have experienced Christianity in a more loving, accurate and traditional form.
