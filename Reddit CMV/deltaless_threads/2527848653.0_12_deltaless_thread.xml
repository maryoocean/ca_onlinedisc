    <title>CMV: Advocacy should be priorized over Objectivity in the Free press</title>
    <original_poster>anonymous68856775</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have heard many people talking about how the job of the press is to remain objective, giving the truth to let the citizens decide for themselves what to believe. However, I believe the opposite. 

First of all, I define Advocacy as a genre of journalism that combines reporting with a point of view, allowing for the writer to express their opinion. Objective reporting is trying to report on facts without distortion.

One of the major purposes of a free press is to be able to articulate criticism is to utilize that power to hold democratic powers accountable. In order for a democracy to function effectively, the ability and persistence of criticism is absolutely necessary. Therefore, the press has a duty not simply to inform, but to take a stance on given issues, allowing Amercians to be exposed to a myriad of opinions, and hold their government accountable. 

Prioritizing advocacy in media reporting and journalism plays a crucial role in protecting human rights by giving a voice to those being harmed and also alerts the audience to injustices. Advocacy transforms a reporter from a mere communicator of information into a motivator for action, allowing for human rights to be upheld. 

An example can be seen in early America. Columbia Journalism review [explains](https://archives.cjr.org/feature/rethinking_objectivity.php) that in the attempt to be objective about lynchings, news sources would cover the murder of a man by the mob, and also cover the reason for the mob’s murder. They wouldn’t mention that lynching was immoral, they simply gave reasons for and against. They then go even further, citing a book on objectivity in the press, “Mindich shows how “objective” coverage of lynching in the 1890s by The New York Times and other papers created a false balance on the issue and failed “to recognize a truth, that African-Americans were being terrorized across the nation.

Objectivity can only tell us what is happening - Advocacy lobbies to fix the issue. If someone is stealing a car, merely observing that fact is not enough. Advocacy is crucial to change.

I wonder if there is something wrong in my logic somewhere, or if there is some benefit of objectivity that haven't found yet.

    <text>The role of communicating information is such an important job. There needs to be an industry that provides the facts so that people can know what’s going on, so they figure out what they should do from the facts. That’s the press and that’s what journalists specialize in producing. That’s their primary duty as a journalist. Being and promoting objectivity is the most important form of advocacy. It’s advocating the importance of objectivity, of thinking and acting according to the facts and not whims/revelation/faith/feelings/intuition. Man’s only means and method of knowledge or being objective is reason and logical inference from the evidence of the senses. Man’s only means of knowing what he should do, how he should act, what he should advocate for is reason. 

The group of people who specialize in promoting particular viewpoints are public intellectuals or activists or whatever, not journalists. You can be all of those, but a journalist when producing news articles should be focused on objectivity. 

&gt; In order for a democracy to function effectively, the ability and persistence of criticism is absolutely necessary. 

You can do this without taking a stance in a news article. Like, suppose the government violates the constitution. You can write a piece that presents the facts necessary for someone to arrive at the conclusion that the government has violated the constitution without taking a stance yourself.</text>
