    <title>CMV: Killing baby cows for food is no more immoral than killing adult cows for food.</title>
    <original_poster>Arandur</original_poster>
    <original_post>Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world. Given that killing animals for food is not generally immoral^1 ,  there is not such a great difference between the experience of a baby cow and an adult cow that one will experience death any differently than the other; neither is the life of a cow so rich and fulfilling^2 that it's immoral to deprive a baby cow of it before it dies.

Therefore, I should not feel any worse eating veal than I do eating a hamburger.

^1 If you disagree with this, that's a different argument entirely; I'm glad to hear your opinion on the matter, but you won't change my view unless your argument assumes this point.

^2 Just the opposite, presently; the lives of cows are full of pain and discomfort, because our (American) food-raising process is horrifying. I *do* think that this is unethical, just based on the principle that pain is a bad thing, but it's not a massive priority for me because I think the amount of human suffering is significantly greater at this time than the amount of animal suffering (due to the greater capacity of a human to experience suffering). Again, this isn't the topic of my CMV, but if you want to give your opinion on the matter I'd be glad to hear it.

    <text>Cows are sentient they definitely have personally and actively interact/respond to the world around them.  </text>

    <text>So does the computer program I just wrote. If I hit a certain key on my keyboard, it prints something funny to the screen. That's [personally] (I assume you meant "personality") and interaction with the world. Is my little bundle of code sentient?</text>

    <text>Computer as of now are incapable of being sentient. Cows can feel things and understand things even though they may be small. Computers can only respond to actions, it prints funny pictures because it is programmed to, which is not evidence of a personality</text>

    <text>Ooooooooo I could argue with you for days about this, but I won't. I was being flippant, because I found their definition of "sentience" to be extremely lacking. </text>

    <text>You are incorrect in saying cows are not sentient. 

Sentient means:
(adjective) able to perceive or feel things.

Cows are definitely sentient. </text>
