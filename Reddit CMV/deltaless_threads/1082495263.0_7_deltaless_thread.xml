    <title>CMV: Donald Trump has taken concrete steps toward establishing a fascist regime, and "losing an election" won't be enough to successfully remove him.</title>
    <original_poster>MaichenM</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm not here to argue whether Trump will win the election, I'm here to argue that it may not matter whether he does.

Right now, what is happening in Portland is what I've come to understand through observation as Trump "flexing" against the barriers that constrain him. No one has been permanently harmed by federal agents purely because that would be too big of a step, too early. He is normalizing the relatively minor violence of terrorizing protesters without actually charging them, and priming the GOP base that supports him to readily accept more severe violence against those that do not support him.

This kind of flexing has gotten Trump really far. He throws something out that sounds insane at first and lets people digest it. Then he does a relatively minor version of it. Once that is normalized, he ups the ante.

The one that worries me the most is his continuous teasing over whether he will accept the election results, and casting doubt on the validity of the election in general. This is coupled with the fact that he still has four months to look at polls, reflect that he is losing, and decide that he must maintain his power undemocratically if necessary. Even if he doesn't come up with a plan to do so, now, there will still be a two-month gap until Biden's reelection that is usually expected to serve as a nice buffer for an orderly transition of power. I know I've mentioned plans, but Trump doesn't need a plan, here. All he has to do is say: "No." At this point, all the resources of the federal government will still be under his control, and his supporters will have already been primed to accept violence toward protesters.

For the purpose of this view, I don't need Trump to successfully install fascism in the US. If he is removed through force, I will still consider myself "right" in the sense that a peaceful election was not enough. My view will be changed if I'm led to believe that Trump will lose the presidency without necessitating violence, or inciting it for his benefit.

EDIT: I have already awarded Deltas to some people who argued in good faith. Starting now, I can't promise that I will respond to everyone, but I definitely will no longer engage with anyone who argues with me on bad faith, or uses personal insults. Thanks to everyone who has presented good arguments.</original_post>

    <text>The reality is that fascism is only possible if you have enough fanatical people to support your complete takeover of institutions.  Trump may wish he had the kind of leader-worship that Hitler or Mussolini had in the 1930’s, but he really doesn’t.  The much more likely scenario here is that Trump will try to find some backdoor way to manipulate the election results so that it appears that he won.  Even if he wins in this way, he won’t be able to do what most fascists are able to do, which is suspend or eliminate democratic processes and remain in power indefinitely.</text>

    <text>There are things I agree with and things I disagree with.

First off, if he finds some backdoor way to manipulate the election results, I'm right, and my argument hasn't been refuted at all.

Second, I think you really underrate the fanatacism of 30% of the population, and what they are capable of doing.</text>

    <text>If it turns out to be election manipulation, you are wrong in the sense that this is not what fascism is.  Fascism is not just another word for authoritarianism, it describes a poitical phenomenon with specific characteristics.  Trump does have some fascistic characteristics, such as his scapegoating of out-groups, but a key difference is that a fascist does not need to rely on fraud or deception to manipulate democracy; rather, they use the power that they gain from stoking hatred in society to *seize* democratic institutions entirely, and then they subsequently eliminate them.

Trump may even *want* to be a fascist leader who is capable of this, but 30% is not going to be sufficient to accomplish this.</text>

Hitler and Mussolini didn't have the Electoral College.  Trump can win reelection [even if Biden gets 77% of the popular vote](https://www.npr.org/2016/11/02/500112248/how-to-win-the-presidency-with-27-percent-of-the-popular-vote).</text>

    <text>The support is less about winning elections and more about having widespread complicity in forcefully seizing / shutting down institutions.</text>
