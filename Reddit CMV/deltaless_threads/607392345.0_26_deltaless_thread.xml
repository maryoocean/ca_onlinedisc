    <title>CMV: Legislative bodies should be required to explain, in formal writing, why they voted a certain way when it comes to legislation.</title>

    <original_post>I think publicly elected officials responsible for driving policy and legislation should be required to explain why they vote certain ways in writing. Voting along party lines is reprehensible regardless of the side. Politics shouldn't be a game about which side wins, but rather which fact-based opinions win regardless of sides. If the legislative bodies have no reasonable explanation for why they voted a certain way besides voting along party lines, they should not be allowed to vote because we have no reason to believe that they're not voting out of self-interest. If, for example, someone in Congress voted against what seems to be reasonable gun law without explanation, but you can see in their financial disclosure that the NRA contributes a lot of money and support for them, how are we to know that their vote was not influenced by the NRA without them explicitly citing so and explaining what other reason compelled them not to vote for said reasonable legislation? I'm not even asking for a long written response from them. A short paragraph or page summary with sources they're using to base their vote on is good enough. </original_post>

    <text>1) Have you ever seen a politician interviewed about their vote on any bill?  Anyone in a prominent political position is capable of defending any sort of position in a reasonable-sounding manner without citing their financial supporters.

2) Does *every* single vote really call for an explanation?  I don't need my state legislators (or their interns) to tell me about their thoughts on what should be the state's flower.

3) Every bill of any importance is already subjected to debate on CSPAN.  If it's really important, it will be discussed on more mainstream TV shows, newspaper articles, etc.  In practice, there are already explanations presented for each side's view(s) on each bill, and anyone who cares can find them easily.  Requiring a paragraph to be written or a form to be filled out won't make people suddenly care more about politicians' explanations or practically changed how politicians' votes are viewed. </text>
