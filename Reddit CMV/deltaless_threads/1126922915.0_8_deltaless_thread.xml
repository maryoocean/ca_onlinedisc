    <title>CMV: Porn ruins people's lives.</title>
    <original_poster>OutlinedSnail</original_poster>
    <original_post>I am posting this here after making this argument elsewhere on reddit. I saw lots of people there arguing that porn in fact does not ruin people's lives, so I accept that possibly my view is flawed.

 I believe that porn ruins lives because :

Porn ruins people's perceptions of themselves and the opposite gender. It ruins marriages and relationships. It van cost people tons of money and even their jobs. It can also lead down disgusting or illegal roads. 

Not to mention the people who are IN the porn. Porn can ruin them as well. More women than you realize are forced or drugged into porn. And no this isn't just dark web porn, this includes porn on pornhub. I guarantee you've seen many videos with blackmailed, drugged, kidnapped, or trafficked women in them. Porn ruins those women's lives as well.

EDIT: I do not mean that watching porn will inevitably ruin your life, i mean it CAN ruin lives, and does more often than people realize/admit.</original_post>

    <text>Is it the porn though or is it merely correlated with the ruining. Take the consumer of porn, isn’t it really their addiction (if they’re addicted) that’s the problem? People who consume porn without letting it become a detriment to their lives have no issue with porn. As for the performers, well I’d say porn ruins their lives in the same way drugs ruin the lives of people killed by cartels- these illegal behaviours wouldn’t need to exist if drugs were legal and well regulated. Similar to porn, if we didn’t treat sex workers badly, made them feel safe to go to the police, regulate the industry better, these problems would largely vanish. So it’s not the porn, it’s the way we handle it.</text>
