    <title>CMV: It should be illegal to have a pitbull that isn't spayed or neutered</title>

    <original_post>Should be self-explanatory. I don't think we should straight up ban the breed, but getting such a dog fixed should be a legal requirement for owning one. Un-neutered dogs are \[responsible for the vast majority of serious attacks\]([https://www.avma.org/Advocacy/StateAndLocal/Pages/dogbite-summary.aspx](https://www.avma.org/Advocacy/StateAndLocal/Pages/dogbite-summary.aspx)) according to the AVMA. This would also result in a pit bull population decline which would reduce the huge number of pits clogging up shelters.</original_post>
