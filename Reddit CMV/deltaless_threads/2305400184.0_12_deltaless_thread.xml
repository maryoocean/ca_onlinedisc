    <title>CMV: Picky eaters deserve more respect and shouldn’t be shamed for being picky</title>
    <original_poster>UsualMorning98</original_poster>
    <original_post>It’s not always the picky eater’s fault they’re picky. It could be due to how they were raised (not their fault), trauma or sensory issues with food (something that can be really hard to work through) and many other factors.

A lot of them either try their best to make things easier for “regular” eaters (bringing their own food to events, looking at the menu beforehand, ordering from the kid’s menu, simply not eating that meal/day etc) or feel extreme guilt when they can’t accommodate to those who will shame them.

I’m not saying they should be prioritised over people with allergies or those with other food needs (like vegetarians or those who don’t eat certain foods for religious reasons). But they deserve a little more respect and support because it’s also hard for them being picky eaters. Definitely prioritise food issues that could harm someone. But once that’s sorted, don’t get mad at the picky eaters for just trying to exist.</original_post>

    <text>Picky eaters should probably be more grateful to their non picky eating friends/partners/family for going along with their picky eating. 

Out of 10 restaurants a picky eater might agree to go to 1, the non picky eater will go wherever so which restaurant is chosen?</text>

    <text>Not all picky eaters will go straight to the one place they can eat at. A lot of us will eat at home in advance and go to one of the other 9 restaurants specifically for the company</text>
