    <title>CMV: Kill La Kill's second half ruins the show (spoilers)</title>
    <original_poster>Candycoatedmuffin3</original_poster>
    <original_post>The high school setting was perfect. It helped keep things grounded (as much as you could), and really tied into the themes of control vs freedom. Satsuki and her student council showed some of the appeal of tight governmental control (fairness, awarding exceptionalism, etc) without ever fully condoning it, but you \*understand\* why people would follow her. Plus, you have the moments where you question if Ryuko is actually making things better, or risks just turning into another Satsuki, which tends to happen very often whenever a revolution happens.

But then you leave the school setting, and then they throw in aliens, and world domination, and the stupid twists and Satsuki's mom who is just the most evil parent in anime, seemingly for no reason. Like, come on! It was so good! Why did they throw it all away?!</original_post>

    <text>The first half of the show seems like gratuitous, violence and sexuality. It's a fun time, it's enjoyable. However, what makes Kill La Kill  amazing is that they actually find a way to incorporate that violence and sexuality into the plot. I actually think it's one of the most ingenious animes. Normally, you see a girl's bouncing boobs, and it's just not realistic. It has nothing to do with the plot. But by making clothing the villain, it's literally part of the action.</text>
