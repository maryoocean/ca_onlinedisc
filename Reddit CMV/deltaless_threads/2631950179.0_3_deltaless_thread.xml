    <title>CMV: Most relationship failure/frustration can be summarized as treating others like crap and get treated like crap back</title>
    <original_poster>itsdoctorlee</original_poster>
    <original_post>It is almost comical how people have been blaming men, women, dating apps, school, God, horoscope + a million more over-analyzed factors as their barrier to finding a satisfying partner and relationship. (but never realizing what they bring to the table themselves)

Two common scenarios pre-relationship:

Women often talk to multiple guys to "increase" their chance of finding the prince charming. Little did they know that it shows on the quality and enthusiasm in how they converse, their behavior and demeanor (And they are somehow oblivious to how obvious that is to a guy with just minimal intelligence). And then they get mad when some guys they are actually interested in don't treat them seriously anymore due to their diluted effort. That is, girls often give guys the impression that they are replaceable entertainment providers.

Guys, on the other hand, set priority in getting girls onto their bed (that is, treating women as sexual tool. I don't think it needs further elaboration). This easily ruins otherwise what could have been a good relationship, and then they are somehow surprised and frustrated that they don't get any relationship satisfaction, appreciation and support in return. (they have been brainwashed that sex is too important, but in fact, the most substantial missing element in mens' life is genuine care and support).

The same happen with existing partners and relationships. Just change it with "having other priorities" in life and it shows a consistent lack of interest and concern about their partners (doesn't matter what you truly want and value, it only matters what you do and show outwardly). Watch your actions and what you are bringing to the table, that's the only thing you need to care about if you want a satisfying relationship.

Edit1: Some commenters rightly pointed out that it is unclear what relationship failure/frustration means. I want to clarify that I mean bad breakups or failed attempt to relationships that results in resentment, as implied by the fact that people feel the need to the point to blame/complain other entities/reasons for their apparent failures.

Edit2: About some commenters trying to give me another reason which they claim as more "ultimate" e.g., I am sampling an immature population from my own experience, or those are "teens" who just have some growing-up to do, they have mental problems, etc. In fact, they validate my point as I am giving "proximal mechanism" that causes relationship failure/frustration. They are by no means mutually exclusive. My post is exactly trying to shed some lights for those "immature" people that some commenters claim I-don't-know-how invalidate my point.

Edit3: To address the comments "sometimes the bad behavior is one-sided and the other party just put up with it". It is a valid point, I very much agree that it would lead to relationship failures and resentments at some point. However, based on mathematical intuition, I would be inclined to think that the "bads" are most often reciprocated at some point later to the "self-unaware" perpetuator, or sometimes even off-target (and then that off-target person grow resentful and retaliate), in order for this vicious cycle of relationship resentment to grow bigger and bigger and more and more people are complaining about it (there are tons of stats that indicate single/loneliness/divorce/relationship dissatisfaction is at an all-time high).

Edit4: The "it is something good, this is what it should be" argument. At no points I am implying if the relationship failures/frustration are either "good or bad". I am just here to describe the most likely cause. Not sure what those commenters are trying to achieve.</original_post>

    <text>Self-help culture tries to reduce every aspect of life down to an individual's willpower, completely ignoring how messy and complex life is. If you're in a positive relationship, this probably has more to do with luck and your own specific life situation than any choices you made as a person.

I have to admit that your post makes me irritated. I strongly dislike your moralising tone and your assumption that every relationship is between a man and a woman.</text>

    <text>As if my post is not clear enough that it is about heterosexual romantic relationships. Do I need a paragraph in my post title for you to not get side-tracked?</text>

    <text>I am not accusing your post of being unclear. I am accusing your post of being written as if straight relationships are the only kind of relationship. Your title needs the word "straight" after "most". 

In any case, I think it's you that's getting sidetracked, because my counter-argument was contained in the first part of my comment which you seem to have ignored.</text>

    <text>Your reply ignore that individual willpower makes up culture and society. I did not accuse "you" specifically, I am accusing all individuals who are stuck in this rat race they are complaining about and yet refuse to do anything (and continue to treat people as replaceable objects rather than human being). That means you could have a relationship frustration problem, exactly because so many other people are treating you like crap, it doesn't have to be a problem of a certain focal individual.  


And how do you want me to respond your statement that *"this probably has more to do with luck and your own specific life situation than any choices you made as a person"* ? How big of a percentage is it due to luck? And what is even "luck" in your definition? The unexplained random noise which changes liberally according to how you construct your statistical model?</text>
