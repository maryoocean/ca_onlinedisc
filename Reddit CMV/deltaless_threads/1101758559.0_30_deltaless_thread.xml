    <title>CMV: Colleges in the U.S. only care about profits and protecting profit generators in the middle of a pandemic</title>

    <original_post>Okay so, as I'm sure other sports fans have noticed, the NCAA has suspended all fall championships outside of division 1 and the Big Ten has officially opted out of the 2020 fall sports season.  Basically universities are recognizing that travel and the inevitable proximity to one another is unsafe and unpredictable.  So, to protect athletes that make them millions, they are preventing competition.  This is completely reasonable and is best practice for navigating the dangers to the health of student-athletes.  

However, they seem to take no issue with bringing in students from all across the country, and in some cases different countries, to live in highly close proximity on campus and go to massive lecture halls.  Why?  As some economists have noted, many universities without huge endowments may go bankrupt without tuition and room and board expenses being maintained by students.  So, they value their profit generators (student-athletes) and want to protect them, but health and safety is out the window if that means losing out on room and board (which would occur if the fall semester was declared online only) and tuition (many students refuse to pay the same price for an online tuition and are opting to take gap years if this is the case).   

It's certainly a financially tough situation for many schools, but should maintaining revenue truly be the driving force behind holding classes in person when big univeristies are signaling that they fully understand how unsafe travelling and being in close contact with people is at this point in the U.S.?  Further, by making this choice to have classes held in person, I believe the vast majority of universities have zero actual regard for the health and well-being of their students if it hurts their pockets.  Change my view?</original_post>

    <text>In addition to what others have mentioned about how many smaller schools cannot afford to not offer classes, there are many fields of study that really cannot have remote instruction. For instance, I'm a music major and I had quite a number of classes that I could not even do work in from home when the virus hit. as many of those classes required technology and equipment most students didn't have, and quite a number of those classes required group performance that was not at all possible.

My point isn't that those classes are worth more than human lives but that there are serious academic drawbacks to not meeting in person for many fields of study.</text>
