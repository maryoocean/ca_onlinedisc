    <title>CMV: the way that conservatives have got in line behind Trump shows that they never really believed in anything in the first place, apart from belonging to a tribe and beating the other tribe.</title>

    <original_post>As things stand, Trump has already been chosen as a presidential candidate once and is massively in the lead to be chosen again. Yet he seems to go against traditional conservative values in so many respects. 

* Family values: he's a known adulterer, "grab 'em by the pussy" etc.
* Religion: clownishly ignorant about the Bible
* Managerial competence: ignorant of basic facts about world and US affairs
* Honest dealing: on his own admission he's exploited bankruptcy rules several times to get out of debts. And where are the tax returns?
* Promises kept: where's the money from Mexico for the wall? Where's the "beautiful" healthcare plan that we were promised?
* Decorum: I don't think I need to say much about this one. Belittling, name-calling, tantrums, the list goes on.
* Democracy: "if I lose then it was rigged". This is probably the biggest of them all. 

I understand that some conservatives have distanced themselves. But the majority of the GOP seems to be behind him. What explains this, except for wanting to feel like you're in the in-group, and wanting to own the stupid libs?</original_post>

    <text>Trumpers hate the liberal establishment and their media.

The liberal establishment and mainstream democrats hate Trump and Trumpers.

We have always voted against things and people more than we vote for things and people.

Political tribalism and taking pride in being superior to the other side has reached a peak.
I am old now and I have never seen America be as much about us verses them politically as it has been lately.

I blame the anti-Trumpers more than than Trump and the Trumpers for the division. Rachel Maddieâ€™s Russiagate was fake news for 4 years. CloudStrike CEO Sean Henry said under oath that neither Russia nor anybody else hacked the DNC and those emails were leaked.

Trump lacked the will to run his administration.
Trump is an immature Narcissistic boy not Hitler.
Trump likes Tweeting, playing golf and eating cheeseburgers and is not interested in running anything.

Tribalism is bad.
Left vs right is stupid.</text>
