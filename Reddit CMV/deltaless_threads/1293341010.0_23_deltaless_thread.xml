    <title>CMV: Every Disney Princess could be reasonably interpreted as a metaphor for mental illness or diagnosed as having one</title>
    <original_poster>DaisyChained23</original_poster>
    <original_post>Examples:

Belle- Stockholm Syndrome. Also maybe NPD (the scene where the villages are singing about how beautiful and special she is could be seen as a grandiose delusion).

Rapunzel - Anxiety (her "tower" is a mental one) and PTSD from an abusive mother.

Elsa and Anna- BPD. Anna is impulsive and reckless and doesn't really have a clear sense of identity. Elsa is impulsive in a different way and cold. They could be seen as two sides of "splitting".

Ariel- body dysphoria. She literally changes the entire lower half of her body.</original_post>

    <text>Honestly, I think you're stretching here by grabbing at straws as you interpret magic for mental illness. Most if not all of these movies have magic. Does every princess who has a sapient animal friend have schizophrenia because most of those animals aren't that smart in real life?

We have Raja, the mice, Pascal, Maximus, Sven, those annoying fuckers from Pocahontas, animals from PatF, and probably more. Could you honestly still argue that all princesses could be mentally ill and leave magic as a reality instead of an interpretation? 

And are you saying LITERALLY all Disney princesses? What about Nala (who's betrothed to Simba even before Mufasa dies)? Why are you adding Elsa into this equation when she's not a princess, but rather a queen? Or Cinderella before the very end of the movie?</text>
