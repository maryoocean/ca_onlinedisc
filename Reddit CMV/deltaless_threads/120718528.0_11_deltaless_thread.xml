    <title>I find that atheists are devoid of compassion for humanity. CMV</title>

    <original_post>When I was a Christian, I found there were assholes mostly but there also seemed to be a profound desire to do good. And when it did happen, it was so fucking relieving. 

I have been an agnostic for some time now. But I feel that people are not very compassionate. They are judgment and form emotional cliques. So their entire moral compass is based on protecting these loved ones and attacking those who 'step out of line?' On top of that, many atheists that I have met are often pretty petty about their ideas and, if something sounds slightly off or 'wrong', they try and shut you down immediately instead of listening. They seem to be completely legalistic.

Is there an humanist or atheist 'philosophy' out there that promote compassion for other people?</original_post>

    <text>As others have said, some people are nice and some people aren't. Some atheists are calm and empathetic people, and some are annoying and petty ones. The problem with meeting atheists, though, is that (in my experience) the former type doesn't reveal themselves to be atheists unless you ASK first. If you know that someone is an atheist without it ever having been relevant for it to come up, there's a decent chance that they're the second type- and that they're going to bias you towards thinking that atheists are all jerks. </text>
