    <title>CMV: People forgo their right to complain if they never do anything about it</title>
    <original_poster>ooselfie</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have a few friends that complain about their life ALL the time. I hear things like:

"My job sucks, I'm miserable here"

"God school sucks, I'm studying something so uninteresting"

I think they have total control - it comes down to laziness, or perhaps they don't even really want anything to happen. It is so easy to put in some extra effort in your day to make things happen for yourself. They complain and complain but never do anything to change. It's like the boy who cried wolf. 

If you constantly complain, but do nothing to mend the problem, then you shouldn't be allowed to complain.

    <text>This rhetoric relies entirely upon people having complete agency over their own lives, which simply isn't the case. Taking the school example, teenagers don't have a say in what they study. You might hate maths, but you need to pass it to graduate high school in most countries. Even if look at college students, actual adults, that logic doesn't really apply because there's a whole variety of factors as to why someone might be studying something. It could be a means to an end, they could have been pressured into it, etc. Saying that people don't have the right to complain about something unless they tackle the issue assumes people always have the ability - physically, mentally, financially, etc - to tackle said issue. </text>
