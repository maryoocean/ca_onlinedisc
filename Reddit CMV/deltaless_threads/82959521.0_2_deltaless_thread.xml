    <title>In the Israel v. Palestine conflict, Israel is by far in the wrong and the US should cut ties with the country. CMV</title>

    <original_post>It seems all that I've seen about the conflict, is Israel either taking over Palestinian territory that isn't rightfully there's, imprisoning innocent Palestinian people, and making Palestine out to be the bad guys.

To me, it seems like all of the violence caused by Palestine is just an attempt to raise attention to their cause. I would necessarily agree with that, but their point is still valid.
