    <title>CMV: There is no reason a “God” should give Free Will</title>
    <original_poster>Protagoras67</original_poster>
    <original_post>I want to disclose that I am both an atheist and a hard determinist. I do not believe in any sort of creator and I have a hard time believing in Free Will. From what I understand from a Christian perspective, God gives humans free will in an effort to test them. But what i don’t understand from their point of view is why would God do that in the first place? Isn’t God omnipotent? God could just design the universe however it wants, we could have all been programmed to behave a certain way from birth and believe in God from birth and follow one religion as opposed to having a myriad of them. There is no reason to test us, it’s completely unnecessary.

Again, I’m not challenging anyone to prove God exists, I am just trying to understand the theological logic of this.</original_post>

    <text>I'll get to a response to/disagreement with your main point, but I have just one brief detour before that.

I don't think that God gives us free will to test us, if what you mean by 'test' is that our free will is more or less for the purposes of deciding what our eternal fate will be. Of course, I may have just misunderstood what you meant.

Now, to your main point, it's important to distinguish between (1) having a reason and (2) having a justifying reason ('justifying' in the sense of morally justifying, since that's the context of the debate). I think your objection uses 'have a reason' in the second sense and not the first, but you can correct that if I'm wrong. That is, I don't think you mean to say that there's no possible reason, however weak, that God could have for giving people free will. One weak reason might be this: perhaps God just likes it. That would be a reason, even if it's not a good one. But this isn't really the problem. The problem is whether or not God's reasons morally justify his decision.

By 'morally justify' I just mean something like this: a parent's decision to send their child to the dentist is morally justified, despite the pain it will cause, because of the good it does for their child. This should be a very familiar notion, and I'm assuming that we agree that this is a morally justifiable decision. It might seem unusual to talk about this kind of thing as 'morally justified' just because people don't normally worry about that. But it's important to recognize that moral justification is involved here, even if it's not explicitly considered, because pain and discomfort aren't things we should inflict on people for no reason at all.

So your claim, as I understand it, is that God could not have a morally sufficient reason (or reasons) for creating a world where people have significant freedom of will. 

You don't actually say why we should believe that God's decision requires moral justification, but I'll assume that you're thinking about the amount or types of evil and suffering in the world. That is, you don't actually give a reason to think that there's anything wrong or bad about God testing us. And if there's nothing bad or wrong about it, then it doesn't require moral justification. It would be like choosing one cereal over another. There's no need for moral justification in the choice of your cereals. So not every decision requires this kind of justification. However, I take it as implicit that you were thinking of the fact that there's a lot of pain and suffering that could be avoided if free will was lacking. Interestingly, I'm not sure you can sustain this claim as a hard determinist, because according to a hard determinist we don't live in a world where people are free, and perhaps that sort of world would have a lot less evil. But that's a bit of a tangent.

Now, there are a lot of different reasons that I could propose as morally justifying God's decision to create beings with significant free will. For example, I might try to say that moral development is impossible without freedom and that people acquiring virtues is a good that outweighs all the evils of our world. However, I'm not going to go that route because there is something which, I think, should be addressed first, which is your assumption that it would be better for God to just determine everything we do. You think this sort of world is better than one with free will and so it's the sort that God should create.

I think you're wrong about the value of such a world. First, *we* do not exist in that world. We are essentially free creatures and we cannot exist without being free. I am assuming libertarianism about free will, but if your theological worry depends upon determinism then it's not one that I have and I can rightly be said to avoid the problem altogether. Second, the value of that world would be significantly hindered by the lack of creatures like us. A world full of robots just isn't as valuable as a world full of free creatures. I'm assuming freedom of will is a good and it seems that many other types of goods, such as rationality, depend on it. So we lose many goods. Third, whatever the value of the pains and pleasures of the non-free beings in that world, they don't amount to the value of our freedom, nor do they give that world sufficient value to make it better than our own. 

Even if such a freedom-lacking world was good overall, our world is overall better. So what I propose, by contrast with your original claim, is that there's no reason for God to create a world where he determines everything we do. That world isn't as good as ours.</text>

Not that i disagree with this point....

But couldn't the parent (from a certain religious perspective) kill their child for the sake of enternal happiness in heaven before the innocence of the child is corrupted? That parent would have a moral justification(in their view) to kill their child. Afterall, it basically guarantees the child goes to some sort of heaven...at least based on more mainstream ideas of heaven.

That's the difference between (forgive me) real world decisions and consequences and those based off faith.</text>

    <text>It sounds like you're questioning whether a certain act would be morally justified, and not the notion of moral justification itself. Unless I'm misunderstanding you. In that case, yes I agree that the act wouldn't be morally justified. It's wrong to kill a baby just to try make sure it goes to Heaven. 

I don't think that human beings are allowed to determine the eternal fate of other human beings. If someone thinks that killing their baby assures the baby's salvation, then they're assuming that God would cooperate with their decision, because God could technically find a way to prevent the outcome even if they killed the child. But, since we aren't meant or allowed to determine each other's eternal fate, I don't believe that God would cooperate with that decision. I don't know exactly what God would do to prevent the outcome, but I'm sure he wouldn't put up with that shit. Maybe your child just gets reincarnated. Maybe your baby never had a soul to begin with. Who knows. 

So, basically, yes it's obviously wrong and I don't think it would work anyway. There's no way for a person to have moral justification 'in their view' for killing a baby for that reason. They're just reasoning poorly.</text>

Didn't exactly reason themselves into believing their religion in the first place. So why stop now.</text>

    <text>Fair enough. People don't generally reason themselves into their religions, their atheism, or their agonisticm. Though reason can play an important role when used properly.</text>
