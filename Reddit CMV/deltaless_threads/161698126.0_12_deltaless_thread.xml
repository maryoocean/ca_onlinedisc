    <title>CMV: It's unfair to complain that a spouse or SO works too much</title>
    <original_poster>rickbrody95</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've seen many marriages have problems because one of the spouses works too much, or is a "workaholic." While I understand that it's frustrating that a spouse or SO is gone for a long time, it seems completely unfair to get mad directly at the person because he/she works the amount that they do

1. The amount of work one does is normally controlled by a boss; having to stay overtime or work an extra shift is often times out of the control of the employee

2. They work hard to support themselves AND their family. It's not easy to support yourself, let alone a SO/Spouse and/or children. The more someone works, the more money they make (normally).

3. There is no good alternative. The employee could request to work less, but that could result in less money and conflicts with employer. They could look for another job, but that's unrealistic; jobs are hard to come by, and leaving a job could leave a person unemployed for a prolonged time.

I understand that an SO/spouse working a lot can be upsetting, but saying you're mad or upset at someone for being a workaholic seems unfair. CMV!

    <text>You've clearly never met a workaholic. 

There are some people that genuinely become consumed by their work. THEY choose to work more than they need to or to take on additional responsibilities. Even when they're not working, they are likely preoccupied with thoughts of their work. 

It is not fair for people in relationships with these people to be neglected by their partner. A relationship requires attention and effort from both parties in order to thrive, especially for multiple years. Without the attention of a partner, it is easy to become distant with each other. This is also besides the fact that it is hurtful to the neglected partner to feel as though the workaholic values their work more than the relationship. It leads to a toxic unfulfillment in the relationship, which causes it to die eventually if not addressed. 

Complaining brings attention to the problem so that it can be fixed before the damage is too late. </text>
