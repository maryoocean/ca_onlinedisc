    <title>CMV - President Trump's "shithole" comment about Haiti is not inaccurate, and because Haiti receives American aid, it should not complain</title>
    <original_poster>Petrus_</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'll focus strictly on Haiti for this.

Calling certain countries shitholes isn't incorrect. I'm not arguing Trump should've said it, but I am going to defend his assertion that Haiti is a shithole, and it shouldn't complain while it receives American aid.

Shithole is defined as:

A very dirty or unpleasant place

Haiti is a shithole, as it has widespread cholera, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, typhoid, and leprosy. All of these diseases are spread in unclean conditions, and all of these are unpleasant diseases, qualifying Haiti as a shithole. In addition, if you look at images of Haiti, the gutters are filled with garbage, the sanitation is horrible, or simply doesn't exist, and most of the country lives in squalor.

To compound this, Haiti is also extremely poor, with the average person getting $350 per year, which is ridiculously low, and can in no way be considered pleasant, further qualifying Haiti as unpleasant, and therefore a shithole.

My final point is that Haiti should not complain about calling a shithole (At least not without expecting some repercussions on it's aid), as it is both accurate, and it is receiving foreign aid to "fix" its problems. Each year, the United States spends $1.5 billion in Haiti (I've seen conflicting sources on the exact number, but the point still stands), which is a huge amount of money. In addition, the US provides 500k meals each day to Haitian students, so without the US, Haitians would be starving, so they shouldn't complain while we literally feed their kids.

Tldr: Haiti meets the definition of a shithole, by being both dirty and unpleasant, so Trump's comment was not inaccurate, and Haiti shouldn't complain by biting the hand that (Literally) feeds them.</original_post>

    <text>Haiti has every reason to complain, as the US has been fucking it over mercilessly for more than a hundred years.

Haiti began as a French slave colony and successfully revolted. Yet the international community forced the slaves to pay an absurdly huge debt to France for liberating French property. They Haitians themselves were part of this property.. The US was instrumental in enforcing. Haiti only payed back these massive, unfair debts in 2010.

In 1915 we thought these debts were making France and Haiti too close so we invaded, removed their financial holdings to the US and rewrote their constitution, giving more rights to foreign landholders. We occupied Haiti for 19 years, committing a number of massacres. 15,000 dead and a puppet government installed.

In the sixties the US helped install and finance Papa Doc Duvalier, a brutal tyrant who used rape as a systematic political weapon. When he embezzled from us we disavowed him, but we kept him around because he had deals with so many American corporations, particularly DuPont. 

We have ever since continued to interfere in Haiti’s politics to protect our interests there. We invaded in again in 1994, and have used it considerable influence to ensure the president of Haiti remains favorable to US business interests. Then in 2004 once they elected a president we didn’t line we supported a coup again.

Then, all the earthquakes and hurricanes, which are hardly Haiti’s fault.

Haiti is a shithole of Americas own making. The Dominican Republic, which occupies the same island, has a much better standard of living, because the US (and France) did not interfere nearly as much there.

    <text>And don't forget the concept of ripple effects; when you destroy a country's economy on a massive scale like this, you subsequently destroy the lives of children and young people on a massive scale.

And those young people who grew up overburdened by socioeconomic and sociopolitical circumstances they had no fault in later grow up to become the adults of that country in the future.

It never stops with the people who were immediately affected by the policy. It trickles down to the next generation.

    <text>Haiti's foreign debts have been relieved or paid off for the most part, and there's no country without debt, so you can't claim that Haiti's debts fucked it over more than the US's debts have. 

The Dulaviers didn't side with the US (Who didn't put him into power by the way), who in fact often accused them of siding with the DR over them, and after his son's ouster, the country erupted into what was essentially a civil war, without US interaction, so you can't claim that was our fault.

And how have we done anything unique in Haiti with respect to "influencing politics?" That's what foreign policy - is protecting American interests abroad. Haiti isn't unique in having it's politics messed with.

Haiti isn't our fault.

    <text>&amp;gt; Haiti's foreign debts have been relieved

Has all the suffering and pain the Haitians suffered before the debts were relieved also been relieved? Did all that suffering, pain, and it's influence on the children just up and disappear as soon as we relieved that debt?</text>

    <text>Are you asserting that those terrible pasts are equal to Haiti's in every way? You got to look at the particulars  and details of Haiti's story, and those of other nations, before you try to suggest that it would be just as easy for Haiti to get over it as it would be other countries.</text>

    <text>Um, you didn't answer my question.

You claimed earlier that Haiti's suffering as a result of it's debt is not relevant because tons of nations/ethnicities had terrible pasts but got over it.

What I asked you, and you haven't answered yet, is if you are asserting that Haiti's struggle is equal in every way to the struggle of other nations. That's what you would need to prove if you want to claim that it is not relevant because other nations had hardships as well.</text>

    <text>That's impossible to gauge. There's no way to examine every tiny event in history, and compare it for each country. It's an unanswerable question.</text>

  <comment id="30028230137.0" user="ShiningConcepts" delta="False">
    <text>Yes, you are exactly right. It is an unanswerable question.

So if, as you acknowledge, this question cannot be answered, then why do you think it is reasonable to make the claim that:

&amp;gt; How is [the suffering of Haiti in the past] relevant? Tons of nations/ethnicities have had terrible pasts, yet they've gotten over it.

For you to claim that Haiti's suffering in the past is irrelevant because other countries have gotten over their terrible pasts, you would have to prove that Haiti's suffering was no worse than those of the other countries you were referring to.</text>

    <text>India/Pakistan is ok, according to people I know who lived there, Syria was fine before it's civil war, with a good education system, good government, and the only bad part was it's police state. South Africa is okay, but not amazing, justa s with Egypt.</text>

    <text>India is 135 in the Gini index rank. India has several areas without basic water treatment. India has an enormous income inequality. India is filled with slums. I mean, it's not "fine" by any means when compared to western countries 

Egypt just had a popular revolt against its dictator. Syria was fine before civil war? Why do you think civil war happened? It's quite obvious that a country that just went through a civil war cannot, by definition, be "fine"

    <text>The US did not incur its debts by being enslaved for 400 years, then overthrowing our slavers, whereupon our slavers stick us with a bill for 150 million Francs (worth a lot more in 1825). The US actually gets stuff when they get into debt — all Haiti got was liberty, no recompense for the hundred years of labor they have to France for free. 

On [Papa Doc:](https://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/2014/10/13/cradle-grave-united-states-protected-jean-claude-duvalier/17191805/)
&amp;gt; For decades, the United States provided money, weapons and troops to sustain the Duvalier regime in Haiti, even after human rights abuses were well known. Jean-Claude Duvalier’s father, Francois “Papa Doc” Duvalier, even used USAID trucks to carry supporters to his political rallies. More recently, Secretary Clinton successfully pushed the candidacy of current Haitian president Michel Martelly, who opposed the prosecution of Jean-Claude Duvalier and welcomed Duvalier’s son into his administration.

And just because we fuck over other countries like we do Haiti is not a good excuse for fucking over Haiti. The fact that this is not unique is as bad an excuse as you can get. If I’m accused of murder, it would be a particularly poor defense that said “Well, that’s nothing special, I murder lots of people”

Edit: Also like to add that the ‘financial aid’ goes primarily to ensure American businesses remain able to do business in Haiti.

Edit2: The truth is all even worse than I’m describing it. If anyone is interested, it’s pretty fucked up to read about.</text>

Freedom has a price. In the US, it was lives, in Haiti, it was money. Whenever power changes hands, the incumbent tries to fuck over the new guy.

And about Papa Doc, yeah he was shit, but he was anti-communist, which at the time was more important.

I never said it was a good excuse, but other countries have come out okay after American "intervention," like the Philippines, Japan and Mexico, each of which is now a world power, even after having the US do some "meddling" </text>

An analogy. A dictator doesn't like you, cut off your 4 limbs. Now you say, "my life is ruined, its the dictator's fault." But the despot says: "Excuses, Steven Furtick has no limbs, and he achieved much."

Haiti reserve the full right to complain as much as US reserve the full right to pull back their aids. </text>

These are insane &amp;amp; immoral things to say. When the US takes on debt, we can use that money to do things, like build infrastructure &amp;amp; pay wages. We also do it willingly. Notice US debt is productive in this sense.

To say that "taking on debt" was simply just the price Haiti had to pay in order to defeat their unjust oppressors &amp;amp; win their independence is an evilness beyond the pale. It wasn't something they did willingly, it was their right &amp;amp; their obligation to revolt. And the debt they incurred was not productive, it was an albatross around their neck.

This simply boggles the mind. People did die in the slave uprising, so they paid with lives **&amp;amp;** money. Does that mean that there is a bare minimum of people that have to die before you don't owe money? Since only 350,000 Haitians died  is that the bare-minimum? If a million Haitians died, would they have been clear of debt? If they didn't win, would they owe? If they did &amp;amp; refused to pay, could the slavers have foreclosed &amp;amp; taken back "their" humans to own as property? If they defaulted in 2009, could France invade &amp;amp; demand payment, not in money, but in slaves?

And about that. Surely that means you break it you bought it and the US owes Haiti reparations?</text>
