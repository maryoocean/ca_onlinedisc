    <title>CMV: Religion is just Peer Pressure from Your Parents</title>
    <original_poster>siddharth_pillai</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't think most people believe in their religion. Nor do they believe in the gods they worship. They simply believe in whatever their parents believe. If you're a theist reading this, ask yourself whether you'd still follow your current religion if your parents were Islamic?

You can speculate yourself, don't you think its more likely that you would be Islamic too? If your parents were Hindus, wouldn't you be a Hindu? If your great grandparents were Sikhs wouldn't your parents and in turn you also be a Sikh?

It may not be true for all but its true for an overwhelming majority of people.

Edit: I'm getting some answers asking about people who convert or have non religious parents, my views don't apply to these people</original_post>

    <text>I believe most things that are forced on you by your parents when you're a child will change your views as an adult. I was brought up Christian and was forced to go to church every Sunday and Wednesday l but as I grew older, I started developing my own opinions and now lean more towards evolution than religion.

If you're brought up without religion, I think you may have a bigger chance developing that kind of faith because it's generally foreign to you as an adult.</text>
