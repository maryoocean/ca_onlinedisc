    <title>CMV: There are no good or bad music genres, just good or bad artists.</title>

    <original_post>I get it. Rock is your favorite music genre, you hate country or pop. Whatever it is, it doesn’t make your favorite genre “the one”.

Music is like food. There’s pizza, hamburguers, sandwiches, tacos, burritos, nuggets, etc. That doesn’t make one better than the other. But there are people or restaurants that can make great delicious pizzas and others who make average pizzas. The same way, there are amazing rappers with great lyricism and rhythm, and others who use an overproduced beat and have poor lyricism. There are Metal guitarists with great technique and years of experience, and others who don’t.

And this whole “my favorite genre is better than yours” thing applies to almost everything: books, videogames, movies...</original_post>

    <text>&amp;gt; There are no good or bad music genres, just good or bad artists.

Does that mean that you're saying that in each music genre, there exist at least *some* good songs/artists?

If the majority of the population dislike the majority of songs in a specific genre, would you then say *well, that's probably just because of the bad artists they have heard*?</text>

    <text>No, I'd say that some genres are more likely to take some getting used to to enjoy.</text>
