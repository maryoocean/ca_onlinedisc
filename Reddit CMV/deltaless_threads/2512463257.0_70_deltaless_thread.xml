    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>Not sure about Canada's take but the 1st Amendment says government can't endorse any particular religion, but it doesn't require any banning of any particular religion. So you can have religious clubs on campus but you can prefer one over another. So if you let 1 club use a room for meetings you must let them all have the same access. 

If you don't allow one, you can't allow others, as that would be preferring one over another. But nothing in the law REQUIRES you to ban any religion. 

I also would like to know what race in particular wears a hijab? People claim it's racist to ban them. What race would that be? I've seen all races wear hijabs. Asians, blacks, white, etc.

BTW, the Jewish head piece is a yarmulke (pronounced Yarn-mah-ka).</text>
