    <title>CMV: vehicles waiting on the side of the road (loading, unloading, breakdowns, buses etc) should use the pavement side indicators only, not hazard lights</title>

    <original_post>The idea here is that hazard warning lights on a vehicle only work when you can clearly see both side lights and there are many many times in city streets where you can only see one set. 

Basically I think it’s more dangerous to be stationary on the side of the road (excluding parked cars for obvious reasons) regardless of the reason and have your hazard lights on, than to just indicate to the side of the road you’re waiting on. 

My reasoning for this is that if you approach this vehicle from behind and one set of lights is blocked, you may think that the vehicle is about to pull out into traffic, which causes unnecessary uncertainty. 

On the other hand if you see a stationary vehicle on the side of the road and you see no lights, you simply steer around it, which is the intended point anyway. 

Overall I think this would help smooth the flow of traffic and reduce uncertainty about intended actions.</original_post>

    <text>In dark areas, having the hazards on will help draw more attention to your car and will help emphasize the width of your car/exact location of the car to help avoid it safely than to just have the pavement side blinkers on.</text>
