    <title>CMV:The death of the CD/Album as the primary means of listening to music and music ownership is bad</title>
    <original_poster>carter1984</original_poster>
    <original_post>Growing up, I saw music delivery move from vinyl to cassette to CD, and now to streaming. My friends and I used to spend hours each month at the record store, browsing through new albums and searching for classics or hidden gems. We'd take them home, put them on and listen while reading the liner notes and digging on the cover art. In many ways, the cover art could be just as cool and compelling as a great record. 

Now, streaming has replaced record sales as everyone either downloads songs from itunes or creates their own playlist from spotify, pandora, or some other service. In the end, you don't actually "own" this music, you're essentially leasing it through whatever service you choose. You lose the tactile enjoyment of pulling vinyl from it's sleeve or opening a jewel case. You the lose the discovery of finding more than one great tune on a record. For example, Fleetwood Mac's Rumours had only four singles, so in today's age how would any discover the great tunes on that record like Second Hand News, Never Going Back Again, The Chain, or Gold Dust Woman?

While you can find all sorts of undiscovered music through streaming, you don't necessarily own it. IT might be a good companion because of its ease of use, but owning physical copies of the music you love is still superior to having a copy on your phone.

CMV, that streaming music is inferior to owning either vinyl or cd's of musical artists work.

This is subjective. I never enjoyed having to switch between albums, or the fact that any one of my albums (and their containers) could be broken, scratched, or misplaced. I also never enjoyed worrying about busted needles, dirty/broken lenses, or blown speakers. My entire collection is stored digitally, and I can listen to it anytime and almost anywhere without having to worry about losing it.

&amp;gt;You the lose the discovery of finding more than one great tune on a record. For example, Fleetwood Mac's Rumours had only four singles, so in today's age how would any discover the great tunes on that record like Second Hand News, Never Going Back Again, The Chain, or Gold Dust Woman?

You can search for that album on Spotify and it's all there, including live versions, early demos, and acoustic versions. If you're a true fan, you can check out the rest of their discography on Spotify, along with a list of related artists like Steely Dan, The Eagles, or Jackson Browne and their respective discographies as well. By the way, this kind of thing is also great for the kids, since there is no way they would have the time and money in this day and age to buy physical copies of all their favorite music. My personal Spotify playlists collectively would cost thousands.

If you're suggesting that physical albums are superior to digital because they offer a more "complete" experience, I would say that viewpoint is purely subjective. I don't feel any different about 2pac's All Eyez On Me album whether I listen to it on a CD or Spotify, and I certainly don't have to stare at a picture of him throwing up a W(estside) to fully appreciate him talking about being proud of his friends for getting out of the ghetto.
