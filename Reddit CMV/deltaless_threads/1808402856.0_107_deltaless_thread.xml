    <title>CMV: Fredom of speech is far more important than a few people being offended</title>
    <original_poster>brbrWh0r3</original_poster>
    <original_post>Freedom of speech should be protected and kept, there shouldn't be people arrested for anti trans comments or insulting a soldier/soldiers, or for nazi jokes, or racist remarks or jokes.

Those should all be handled between people, if someone says stuff you dont like you handle it, simply block them or avoid them, theres a whole world you can be in and that persons in a very tiny part of it. 

It makes me nervous seeing people arrested and charged for saying things. It's only leading us to a place where we can be arrested for saying whatever the government doesnt like. And they shouldn't be in that much power to effect our communication with eachother. 

I live in scotland and dont feel I have freedom of speech anymore. 

(For the record I'm a white woman who's bi and have trans thoughts ig for those folks who say it never has been about me, it has sometimes, and in more ways than just those)

Edit: No it's not just anti trans people, Yes I believe crimes other than hate crimes involving speech should be illegal (threatening violence, doxing, defamation) but I also believe insults, jokes and bad takes or thoughts should not be.

Edit 2: Consequences for what is said like losing a job, getting insulted, losing friends ect is totally fine I just dont think the Government should be in charge of what can get you arrested in this sence.

Edit 3: I live in SCOTLAND in the UNITED KINGDOM or in BRITAIN depending what you say, I'm not american, im also not here advocating for my right to be a dick, im just saying the government arent the ones I want saying what I cant say, I mean twitter can destroy lives without them anyway.</original_post>

    <text>you're in luck then because 'insults, jokes and bad takes or thoughts' is perfectly legal and you will not be charged with a crime; indeed you will not find one piece of legislation across the UK where insulting someone is enough to potentially give you a criminal record.

 in order for it to be a crime it must go beyond(!!) that, to where it is now, in a nutshell, threatening one or more persons or threatening public order which the majority of citizens would agree is perfectly reasonable.

the issue is there's this sexy moral panic going around fueled by poor journalism and political entertainers like Ben Shapiro that just by being un-PC is enough to land you with a criminal record, and the public loves to eat it up for some reason. no one bothers to actually read the legislation itself or case law; they just read a clickbait headline in the news about someone saying something 'anti trans' and now suddenly assume and fear you can't say women have a uterus or whatever lest the cops come knocking. watch out JK Rowling.</text>
