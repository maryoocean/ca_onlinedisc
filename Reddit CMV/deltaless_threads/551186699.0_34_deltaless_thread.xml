    <title>CMV: Diamonds are a complete waste of money</title>
    <original_poster>DarkPhoenix07</original_poster>
    <original_post>So, I recently went into a store to look at having a piece of jewellery made. While I was there, the staff were making out like anything other than a diamond will basically be a piece of garbage.

Having no knowledge of these things, I almost agreed to purchase quite a sizeable diamond which would have blown my budget. In my mind, why buy the jewellery at all of it's just going to look like cheap trash...

Luckily, I didn't. I've now done some research into moisanitte and white sapphires and I'm really struggling to understand why diamonds are worth anything at all.

Moisanitte gems are rated on the same colour and clarity scale as diamonds so visually they conform to the same standards. Yes, a diamond is a 10 on the mohs scale, but a moisanitte is a 9.6.

Regarding the price, I was offered a visibly yellow diamond, uncertified, enhanced (has had silicone injected) 0.8ct for $1900. I can buy a 1.25ct moisanitte, perfect clarity, same cut for $700.

When trying to find out why diamonds are worth more it appears to be for two reasons:

1. About a decade ago, a diamond company (de beers I think it was) spent millions on an advertising campaign to promote them then raised the prices.

2. As a status symbol. Literally just so that people can say that "their ring cost $17,000"

Based on that, the value of a diamond is only what we percieve it to be. If that were ever to change a lot of people will have worthless, albeit pretty, rocks on their hands that cost them the same as a house deposit. 

So please, change my mind. If you can't my girlfriend is getting a moissonite ring ðŸ˜‰</original_post>

    <text>Just spent $6000 on a custom diamond ring. After seeing the look on her face I have zero regrets.

Actually though, I knew it was the right decision before I even had it forged. When I met with my gem guy he pulled out loose diamonds and let me paw over them and hold them up to a shaft of light. My inner dwarf-under-the-mountain squinted, and calculated. Her inner elvish-nymph would like this one with red hues and blue fire. Do I want rose gold? No, I donâ€™t want my gold tainted with something less valuable, better go with a mix of rhodium for strength. Do I need more diamonds? Yeah, I think I need a matched pair for the outside, because thatâ€™ll be way doper than just a center stone. I just cut that motherf*ing check and walked out of there feeling slightly hungry still, so then I ate at this Mexican place next door.</text>
