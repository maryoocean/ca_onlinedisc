    <title>I think that if Israel had gained it's independence fair and square. CMV.</title>
    <original_poster>AlexiPwns</original_poster>
    <original_post>So I know this is kind of political, but let's try to keep this on subject.

I'm a Zionist who is also an atheist, so let's try and keep religion out of this, because this is definitely not the reason I support Israel.

Thing is, there's this thing called "Romantic Nationalism", it's a form of nationalism in which the state derives its political legitimacy as an organic consequence of the unity of those it governs. 

In Israel's case that's religion and I'm pretty sure that that's how it got recognized as a state. I understand that a lot of people disagree with this because the land wasn't theirs to begin with and that just because some group claims an old book told them it is, is just a logical fallacy.

Problem is, almost the exact scenario happened almost 200 years ago with Finland. 

The Kalevala was a compilation of old Finnish folklore and mythology (Kind of like a bible, written to sum up oral mythology) During the Russian reign, the Finns tried to used the Kalevala to legitimize their nationality and gain recognition as a state. (Pretty much like the Zionist movements during the British mandate).

In case number one, there were people (Swedes) who lived on a territory that they used to own but was then taken by another country (Russia). The "natives" just accepted their fate and either returned to their land (Sweden) or became part of the ruling country (Russia). 

While this was happening. There was a second, much smaller group of people (The Finns) that claimed that this was their land long before the "natives" took over. With the use of a book that contained their mythology (Kalevala), they tried to gain independence from the ruling country. They did. (The Swedes eventually either moved to Russia or came back to Sweden).

In case number two, we see the exact same scenario. The Russians are the Britts, the Swedes are the Palestinians, the small group is the (now) Israelites and the Kalevala is the Jewish Bible.

The only difference, is that Britain didn't want to get involved like Russia did, and left the mess to the two rivals.

If this were the late 19th century, this whole conflict would never have happened.

TL;DR : The British were pussies and this whole thing got started just because the Palestinians wanted more land.</original_post>

    <text>Alright following this logic: Natives are completely within their right for slaughtering Canadians/Americans and causing riots and overthrowing the government. Or they could take a giant piece of land and call it their own country and nobody can do anything about it. Why? Because hundreds of years ago it was their land and they owned it. Just because someone else did it doesn't make it right.

Second point: A lot of people aren't riled up that Israel is a country. They are riled up with what Israel is/was doing. Take the Gaza strip for example. [Watch this video of a Jewish MP talking about what they are doing.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMGuYjt6CP8) If your too lazy or cant watch it for some reason the gist of what he is saying is what Israel is doing to them is comparable to the actions of the Nazi's. One of the quotes he said was "Israel was born out of terrorism". Israel displaced and destroyed the lives of tens of thousands of innocent civilians who had been living in the area for as long as they can remember. Simply, because they were there first.So your argument as to "Israel had gained it's independence fair and square" is simply immoral and unethical. You are rationalizing the actions by simply stating that someone else did it so why can't we do it?</text>

    <text>That's not really what I'm saying. I'm saying that if it were a different time then quite possibly all of this would never have happened and Israel would be a proper state.

Granted I didn't watch the video, but saying that what Israel is doing is comparable to the Nazis is just plain wrong and immoral.

Lets start off by saying that about 20% of the Israeli population are Arabs. Arabs that lead a very peaceful life as Israeli citizens. Not a very Nazi thing to do.

Nearly all of the Palestinian terrorists that were caught are either held in very humane prisons or in Israeli hospitals. Again, not very Nazi.

I'm sorry, helping terrorists get back on their feet and seeing them as more than Muslim extremists is everything but immoral.

As for the beginning of your comment, I'm not saying it *has* to immediately be theirs, but they are very eligible since they have their historical connection to it. Therefore, winning the majority of the votes in the UN, kind of gives them the right to claim the land. Since it wasn't really Palestinian to begin with (it was under British mandate).</text>

    <text>There really weren't that many people that identified as Palestinians prior to the creation of the modern state of Israel. There was a movement of Palestinian independence around WW1, but it was mostly after Israel that it became a widely shared identity. It is a modern identity. I would argue that just because it is modern, it does not mean the identity is invalid, but there is really little question that there is no historical ethnic identity of Palestinians prior to the creation of Israel, and only some marginal sense of national identity for a brief period before that. In general the peoples inhabiting what became Israel were mostly Arabs, Jews or Christians, and of the Arabs, they were largely Jordanian, Syrian, Lebanese or Egyptian. Palestine was really just an administrative region under the British with some vague historical references to it under different names before the Ottomans.</text>

    <text>This line of arguing seems like semantics. I don't see what the name of the country/people has to do with the claim of the land. Take a region like the Elzas for instance, which has been passed between Germany and France for centuries. If you were living there you would have the French nationality one week and the German nationality the next. If a third government conquered the region, named it Mandate of Elzas and declared the people living there Elzatians, would we now say that Elzatians have no claim to the land they live on because there were no Elzatians five years ago and therefore the Germans have the oldest claim?

The way I see it, it doesn't matter what name/nationality/identity you go by. So when Palestinians started to identify as such has little meaning in the debate. When borders are changed you might suddenly find yourself living in a different(ly named) country. That doesn't change the fact that you have been living there all your life, that your family has lived there for centuries, and that as far as I'm concerned you have every right to keep on doing so.</text>

    <text>&amp;gt;I don't see what the name of the country/people has to do with the claim of the land.

First, I want to make clear that I never said Palestineans have no claim to Palestine. I only said that one of the earlier posters was correct when he said there wasn't anything like a Palestinean identity until modern history.

Further, considering most of what is now Palestine was previously part of Jordan or Syria during the Six Day war, and since that land was essentially taken from those countries that had attacked Israel, it does matter if we hope to contextualize the issues of each party in the present day conflict. After all, we can't ignore Israeli's legitimate interests in this matter as stakeholders in the region anymore than we can ignore the interests of the present Palestinian occupants.

I actually am glad you brought up Elzas (I assume that is an alternative spelling of Alsace, as in Alsace-Lorraine, perhaps a German spelling), because is sort of does illustrate how these things work and how complicated they become with the march of history. But, as there was no independent call for recognition of an Alsace state so the analogy isn't quite perfect.

In many ways, this situation is more analogous to that of Kosovo, and honestly if you've paid any attention to the way Kosovo has played out, simply handing it over to what amounts to an ethnic Albanian majority has resulted in a number of serious issues, and has been a source of continuous regional tensions. I'm not sure that is a great result.  Still, even Kosovo is not perfectly analogous, as its connections to Serbia as a territory run pretty deep

Really, my point here is that a conflict like this is either solved in a zero-sum fashion, or it is solved cooperatively. To be solved cooperatively, the interests of both parties have to be acknowledged. Understanding why Israel has an interest in Palestine and understanding why self-identified Palestinians have an interest in Palestine is important in reaching a lasting resolution.</text>

    <text>I realize you're not the OP, after seeing more of OP's comments and following some of the links it seems OP is indeed arguing that because Palestinians have not been named Palestinians throughout history they have no rights to claim land. I'm amazed someone would be willing to argue that and view the world to work in such a simple way.

Elzas is indeed an alternative of Alsace (in Dutch actually, German would be Elsass).</text>

Trying to claim the people who had lived in Palestine for over a thousand years were Arabs but not Palestinians is disingenious. Kind of like claiming there is no 'American' nationality because after all they are all English.</text>

    <text>Arabs that live a peaceful life as Israeli citizens? Are you unaware of the apartheid in that country? The Arab population falls behind in every single social indicator, generally live in segregated dilapidated communities, attend segregated schools, are usually unable to make a living outside of cheap exploited labor, and it even has gone so far as the Israeli government specifically appropriating just enough calories to Arab populations to avoid malnutrition and nothing further. 

And a large segment of the Arab population there have had families living there continuously much longer then a large segment of the Jews have so this whole notion of Palestine as an "invented" country with somehow fake people is a travesty and an insult and I think for you to truly understand what is Israel actually is you need to get that hateful idea out of your head. </text>

They live in big Israeli cities, attend Israeli public schools and the new generation is either fluent in both Hebrew and Arabic or just Hebrew (the older generation does not approve). Some of them even sign up to the Israeli army voluntarily.

When saying there's no such thing as Palestinian, I mean that they're all just Syrians. Look at the last names, look at the faces. It's either Syrians or Egyptians.</text>

Could you elaborate please? I feel as if you are stating something and I am arguing something else entirely.

&amp;gt;Granted I didn't watch the video, but saying that what Israel is doing is comparable to the Nazis is just plain wrong and immoral.

Why would it be wrong or immoral. Keep in mind that this is note me who said this but by a man who has personally known most of the Israeli's Prime Minister's since the birth of the country. He has been working with Israeli politics for a very long time and knows a lot more about Israeli actions than you or I combined. So don't be so quick to judge and say no.

[You](http://www.middleeastmonitor.com/articles/middle-east/3551-confined-cruelty-israeli-treatment-of-palestinian-minors) [also](http://www.geopolitics.us/?p=744) [have](http://www.globalresearch.ca/they-shoot-children-don-t-they-confined-cruelty-israeli-treatment-of-palestinian-minors/30076) [shit](http://electronicintifada.net/content/new-book-exposes-brutal-treatment-palestinian-prisoners/10237) [like](http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories) [this.](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/28421427/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/qa-history-behind-israels-gaza-offensive/) All of which was yielded by simply a quick Google search. Now I'm quite sure someone more learned in the subject could provide more insight. But this fact remains clear. The people of Gaza were not at all treated humanely and many people even children died because of causes ranging from Israeli soldiers to malnutrition.

&amp;gt; As for the beginning of your comment, I'm not saying it has to immediately be theirs, but they are very eligible since they have their historical connection to it. Therefore, winning the majority of the votes in the UN, kind of gives them the right to claim the land. Since it wasn't really Palestinian to begin with (it was under British mandate).

So essentially I would be forced to seek refugee status in another country because of a conflict that happened centuries ago? I'm sorry but what historical connection is there? They have a spiritual connection to the land simply because their ancestors lived on it as well? We should not be reopening conflicts that were closed centuries ago, but rather find a way to peacefully coexist. They are entitled just as much as I am to live on this land. </text>

    <text>I'm on mobile, so I can't quote you, but I'll try my very best to answer in the right order.

Basically what I said was that the politics of 200 years ago were very much different from today, and Finland got it's independence pretty much like Israel (not exactly the same way but there are a lot of similarities).

I told you why it would be wrong and immoral. There is nothing worse than a Nazi. These guys did horrible, unspeakable things. I compared the two in my previous comment.

In one of the sites you provided, there was a poll among Palestinians about wether they should end the war with a peace agreement or continue it until the Jewish race is wiped off these lands. You can guess what a vast majority has chosen. And another article about how badly they're treated in prison said that they're peace seeking activists and not terrorists.

During Operation Cast Lead and Cloud Pillar, the Hamas used [human shields](http://frontpagemag.com/2012/dgreenfield/hamas-interior-minister-boasts-of-using-elderly-and-children-as-human-shields/) and [endangered their own people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI1q3etFX2k), so you can understand why there are so many civilian casualties and deaths. I remember when there was a big problem; one of the Hamas leaders was hiding in a civilian home, there were a lot of innocent people there and Israel didn't want to kill them so they used some tactic to lure him out (details are blurry, this was long ago).

As for most of the things you think Israel may have done, [here](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallywood). I know that Israel did in fact do a lot of things wrong, and cruelty to prisoners and Palestinians is wrong. But these are the mistakes of children (drafted at 18 to the Israeli army) who received one hell of a punishment.

I didn't want to go there, everyone is accused of war crimes here. But I really wanted to focus on the legibility of Israel if it were 200 years ago.</text>

    <text>Alright thanks for the clarification.

&amp;gt;Basically what I said was that the politics of 200 years ago were very much different from today, and Finland got it's independence pretty much like Israel (not exactly the same way but there are a lot of similarities).

So you think just because someone did it centuries ago that its OK? Was there supposed to be a time when it was supposed to be alright? I'm sorry I am really not seeing any logic or rationale in this argument of yours. Your entire defense is pretty much summed up by "they did it, so why can't we". If anything we should be the ones to let go of all that and say "NO! We will be different. We created things like the news and media so that we can better understand what is going on around the world and stop anything wrong from happening. We have moved past this and we will not let the actions of our forefathers justify the crimes we do today." However, if I am still understanding this wrong then please correct me because I hope I am. I honestly do not see how anyone could justify any sort of war/conflict or whatever is going on there by the logic you have just presented.

As for your point about the treatment of Palestinians. I am going to drop it as it doesn't really have anything to do with your argument and I don't want to start another one. So I'm sorry for bringing that up.

    <text>Thank you.

You didn't get me wrong, that's exactly what I'm saying. Aside from the war thing. There was no war with the Finnish.

I'm talking about the basic concept of gaining independence because you feel a certain relation to the land and it's culture. The Zionist movement based it's arguments around "Jews were there first, they feel connected to this land and share a history on it. They need a place to be Jews". 

And I don't understand why some countries would say that's wrong thinking when another country did basically the same 200 years earlier.</text>

  <comment id="26845399631.0" user="IntrigingPerson" delta="False">
    <text>Those Palestinians had as much connection (if not more) to the land than the Zionists did. Nobody is saying "there shouldn't be a place for Jews to be Jews". People are against Israel because of the way it was created. They essentially said this is a Jewish state now and too fucking bad if you have been living here your entire life this is our land now.

It is wrong thinking no matter what time it is. Its just more controversial now because 1)its recent and 2)people are more educated now about the struggle than people were centuries ago. Once again we should be the people to shed these thoughts that we could justify crimes committed because it was committed centuries ago. We should not be creating new conflicts but rather finding a way to peacefully coexist. Contrary to what many people might think but Muslims (I know were talking about Arabs but most of them are Muslims so bear with me here) and Jews lived together peacefully for centuries. So why can't we now? As soon as you create the segmentation of 'them or us' you create conflict. Islam and Judaism share so many core principles. So why the need for a Jewish state and tell the Muslims this is our country? Why not establish a country for both? That way Jews can still be Jews in land they have whatever connection you are claiming that they have. The Arabs will not feel as bad about it. And organizations such as Hamas will have a lot less credibility.</text>

    <text>I've said it before, [there's no suck thing as Palestinians](http://www.factsandlogic.org/ad_91.html).

Also if you could, check out [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVdPhigzIY0). Check out the description. It pretty much says it all. There is no such thing as a Palestinian nation.

Again, being unrelated but fine:
I'm all for peace and living side by side, but it's the other side that doesn't want peace. Their polls show it, their terrorist organizations show it and most importantly, their politicians show it (because there were countless attempts for peace, all of which failed).

My view is that it's not a bad and immoral thing to do. They lived there, were exiled and now they want to come back. They were exiled from Israel, then Europe and were treated like second class citizens in Russia. No matter where they went, they were always subject to pogroms and racism. I think founding a country on those grounds is only fair. 

Let me start off by saying that there were Jews in Israel before it gained it's independence, the numbers just grew because now the haunted Jews of Europe and Asia had somewhere to go.</text>

    <text>I don't think it's fair to say that there is no such thing as a Palestinian nation. While I think the evidence fairly conclusively shows that there was no such thing as a distinctly Palestinian identity before the 19th century at the earliest and maybe even as late as the 1970s, I think it's beyond debate that it exists now. Enough Arabs identify and are recognized as Palestinian to make it a distinct nation. Ironically, it was largely because of Zionism that "Palestinianism" developed but regardless of how or why the Palestinians came into being, that identity is no less legitimate than a Jewish identity. </text>

    <text>Ok, if we can agree that the Palestinian nation is only 43 years old, then the argument "they were here before the Jews" is logically invalid.

In which case, my view hasn't changed and the Jews still got their independence fair and square. It's not to say that the Palestinians aren't eligible, they are. But on Arab lands, not Israeli, or through some peace agreement that gives them land on Israel.</text>

    <text>I'm not trying to change your view that Israel was established legitimately. I completely agree that legally and morally, Israel has a right to exist. But I don't think it's very helpful to the debate to deny Palestinians their identity or say that because they didn't identify as Palestinian, they have no connection to the land.

A Palestinian can point to an olive tree and say that this is his land, his ancestors have lived here for 1400 years. And he would have a point. I don't think it matters what he called himself, whether he identified as Arab, Syrian, Palestinian, Shami (Levantine Arab), Egyptian, whatever. 

A Jew can then say that he could trace his connection to the land back 3000 years to King David, that his people lived there until being forcefully expelled by the Romans, that even then Jewish communities continued to exist and were built upon until the re-establishment of Israel. Many Zionists would say we aren't *returning* to Israel. We never really left.

And that's at the crux of the conflict. Two groups both claiming to be indigenous to the land. And the thing is, they're both right. So, yes, Israel's founding is completely legitimate. It's an amazing little country that has done incredible things with very little to start from. But that would not make a Palestinian state in the same borders any less legitimate had things gone a different way (and I'm glad they didn't). That both nations can't both have a nation-state in the same land is why the two state solution is so important. Both Jews and Palestinians have an intimate connection to the land and both sides need to give up parts of it to make everyone kind of, sort of happy.</text>

Ask any arab from that area and they would have identified themselves as Palestinian. And i dont care  what a bunch of politicians were paid to say what they were. This was their home, their entire lives. Every memory they had, their living everything they ever held dear was there. You claim that jews were treated badly in the past. That is true.

I feel like the Arab members of the Knesset would disagree with you on that.

&amp;gt;Ask any arab from that area and they would have identified themselves as Palestinian.

And Jews and Turks living there would have as well. There's a big difference between saying "I am Palestinian because I am a resident of Palestine" which anyone living there could have said and "I am Palestinian because I am a member of the distinct ethnic, cultural, or linguistic nation of Palestine" which no one said up until the advent of Zionism at the earliest (the prevailing view being that a distinctly Palestinian identity as understood today didn't emerge until the early 20th century).

&amp;gt;You claim that jews were treated badly in the past. That is true. But i dont care about that because none of them are alive and its not as if its continuing any longer (there might be some isolated cases but for the majority they have it alright).

This is beyond stupid. You realize there are still living Holocaust survivors, right? It wasn't that long ago. There are still living Jewish refugees that were driven out from Arab and Muslim countries. That happened only about sixty years ago. There are hundreds of thousands of former Soviet Jews who were oppressed. All three of those groups largely wound up in Israel which makes Israel's identity as a Jewish safe haven even more bona fide. And it's hardly isolated incidents. Antisemitic incidents are at the highest in Europe since WWII.

&amp;gt;They should be the ones that say we should break this vicious cycle for ourselves and our children. You should say i have seen the negative effects of such actions and i dont want them to continue.

Do you hold the Palestinians to the same lofty standards? </text>
