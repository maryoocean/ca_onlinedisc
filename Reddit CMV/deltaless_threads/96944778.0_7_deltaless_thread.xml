    <title>Childless adults should not go to Disneyland and Disneyworld. These are for children and families, and adults have the entire world to experience. CMV.</title>

    <original_post>As an adult of moderate means, you have access to the adventures and experiences that Disneyland (and related parks) simulate. You can go whitewater rafting, tour Czech castles and Parisian catacombs and sail the actual Caribbean. Disneyland is obviously an amusement targeted at children, and so adults without children should seek alternative forms of entertainment.

As a more practical addendum to the above, I gather that Disneyland and other parks are exceptionally busy, often resulting in long lines for the attendees. If adults without children eschewed them, then they'd actually be enriching the experience for the parks' target audience.

EDIT (Sept. 4, 19:00 CET): I'm afraid I'm out of time to respond to other comments--thanks for the conversation.</original_post>

    <text>My favorite section in Disneyland was always Tomorrowland, and if I were to go as an adult, that would probably still be my favorite. How am  I supposed to go on a real mission to Mars, shrink to the size of an atom, or even just ride a submarine?
