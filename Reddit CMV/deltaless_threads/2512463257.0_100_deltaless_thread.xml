    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>As an atheist, I disagree. Public schools should be secular. It does not mean it should suppress religion. If my religion demands that I wear a turban, I should be able to do so in school. If I need to pray while in school, I should be provided with a room to do so. 

I believe secular means not promoting religion and not being guided by religion. So, teaching religion is off limits. Promoting religion or allowing others to promote a religion is off limits. But exercising your religion without bothering others should be ok. You obviously cannot just start chanting or praying out loud during class, but going to a room and praying there during a break should be completely ok. 

bear in mind that completely banning religion will simply dribe more kids to religious and private schools.</text>
