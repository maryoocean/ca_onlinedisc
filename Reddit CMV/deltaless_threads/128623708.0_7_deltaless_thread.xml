    <title>CMV: I believe that, to vote, people should prove a degree of selflessness (shamelessly stolen from starship troopers)</title>
    <original_poster>incruente</original_poster>
    <original_post>I believe that democracy is the worst system of government we have...except all the others (another shameless theft of a quote). But, like all things, democracy should be tempered with wisdom. There are already requirements to vote; being an adult, being a citizen, not being a felon (in some cases). I think that, in order to vote, you should have to prove that you have the interests of society at least partly in mind. In the book starship troopers (which is on the recommended reading list for the navy....weird much?), you have to serve society in a real, tangible way in order to vote. In the book, it's referred to as "federal service". In real life, I think the Swiss have it (mostly) figured out: mandatory military service (but for men only, which is why I said "mostly"). But for those unwilling or unable to perform military service, perhaps other public service for, say, two years; work as a 911 operator, or even for public works. But have a job assigned to you and serve the people, to prove you're not totally selfish.

Thus, the voting body is made up of people who are provable capable of giving of themselves for others. No other rights or privileges would separate the voters from the nonvoters. 

As an added bonus, if we did mandatory military service, we could have an unbelievable state of military readiness in this country. Imagine if even 50 percent of all our people were armed and had combat training. The military would be massive, but could serve a lot of functions; municipal construction, disaster response, even things as mundane as sorting recycling. Believe me, the military already does a lot of mundane stuff. Imagine a country where everyone that chose to serve would be trained and equipped to serve their country, and every person that voted would have proven that they had the best interests of society at heart.

    <text>I think democracy itself is a form of selflessness in the sense that the voter perceives and acts on issues that have no direct impact on oneself.

I don't think willingness to self-sacrifice should be a criterion to eligibility to vote, because that doesn't always benefit society. Consider the person who drowns in the rapids trying to save another drowning person, who also drowns. There is a net loss to society as a result, because one person died "needlessly" in the sense that the rapids is a death trap for any swimmer.</text>

    <text>I doubt that many people now vote on things that have no direct impact on themselves.

A willingness to be selfless seems like it would be an ideal element of a voter. Just because ideal elements can go wrong is not a reason to discoun them completely.</text>

    <text>Put it this way, democracy requires a recognition of state beyond self, otherwise people wouldn't vote. 

I am also not sure of how to test for self sacrifice. I don't think military service is a good test for that.

I am taking selflessness to be capable of self sacrifice.</text>

    <text>I can easily imagine someone that votes having lack of a recognition of state beyond self. I'm also not sure of how to test to a certainty for self-sacrifice. But I think that a willingness to serve the public is a test to a reasonable degree of certainty for a degree of selflessness.</text>

    <text>You will have to clarify what 'willing to serve the public' is. To me, that means working for the government, which I am convinced is not a good criterion.</text>

    <text>It would mean, in some aspect, working for the government. But mostly because the private sector couldn't, I think, be regulated to the necessary degree.</text>
