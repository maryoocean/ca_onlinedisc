    <title>CMV: Every straight girl out there secretly wants to date a rich guy</title>
    <original_poster>windmill230</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let's be honest here. Some girls say that they have no desire to date rich guys as they are looking for true love but really they are just lying. And as for girls who don't pursue rich guys, they secretly want to do this and the only reason why they did not do this is because they know that rich guys are out of their league.

Some people say that money is not a priority but really it is. Who doesn't want a rich husband who treats you nicely? "Money cannot buy happiness" is just a myth propagated by not-so-well-off people with a sour grapes mindset. The truth is deep down, everyone values money and secretly desires to be rich. I don't believe it when a girl says that she has no particular desire to date rich guys.

    <text>I'm curious why your view is limited to straight women. If we're dealing with hypotheticals, wouldn't anyone prefer a partner for whom money is not an issue over one living paycheck to paycheck? Why is this a thing for straight women, rather than people in general?</text>

    <text>Just to make my question more specific. And it seems like women tend to be into dating rich men while men tend to be into dating hot girls.</text>

    <text>That seems like a rather limited scope. People don't choose companions based on single characteristics: you're drawn to people based on a variety of things. To be clear, those things include (but are not limited to) attractiveness and financial stability. 

So if I were single, and someone wanted to set me up with their friend, then each positive characteristic would just add to their appeal. If she was pleasant to be around, that would be sort of the minimum. If she were also hot, or also rich, or also ridiculously funny, or any number of other qualities, that would be even better. 

So yes, a woman might like to date a rich guy. She'd probably prefer to date a rich hot guy, or a rich hot guy with a great sense of humor who is a good cook and shares her interests. But any combination of positive attributes (including combinations without "rich") would be preferable to a guy who's just that minimum of pleasant to be around. </text>

    <text>Obviously a woman will not go for a rich guy who lives a playboy lifestyle if she wants to get married and start a family, but what I mean is every women secretly desire a rich guy who is decent in terms of personality.</text>

    <text>What's your point, though? Who doesn't want a partner who can buy them expensive things, guarantee financial security and be fun to hang out with? I'd like a boyfriend who can make chocolate appear out of thin air and so would a lot of people, why does that matter? You can't have everything you want, that doesn't mean anyone who isn't 'perfect' isn't good enough.</text>

    <text>I'm not sure what you're trying to say here. It seems like you're ignoring my arguments and simply restating your view.</text>
