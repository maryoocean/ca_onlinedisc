    <title>CMV: Every Disney Princess could be reasonably interpreted as a metaphor for mental illness or diagnosed as having one</title>
    <original_poster>DaisyChained23</original_poster>
    <original_post>Examples:

Belle- Stockholm Syndrome. Also maybe NPD (the scene where the villages are singing about how beautiful and special she is could be seen as a grandiose delusion).

Rapunzel - Anxiety (her "tower" is a mental one) and PTSD from an abusive mother.

Elsa and Anna- BPD. Anna is impulsive and reckless and doesn't really have a clear sense of identity. Elsa is impulsive in a different way and cold. They could be seen as two sides of "splitting".

Ariel- body dysphoria. She literally changes the entire lower half of her body.</original_post>

    <text>None of the mental illnesses would apply to any of your examples in any professional setting because there are no symptoms present. For example:

The mermaid wanted to be human to pursue love. There was no body dysphoria of any kind and the story is merely an adaptation of an existing story by Hans Christian Anderson.

Belle traded her life for her father. Thereâ€™s not a shred of Stockholm Syndrome present. 

Rapunzel never had a shred of PTSD displayed in the movie at all. She was led to believe she was loved by her fake mother all her life.</text>
