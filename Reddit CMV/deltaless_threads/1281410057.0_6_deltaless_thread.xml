    <title>cmv: Imposing extreme regulatory controls on the stock market would benefit the economy for most people.</title>
    <original_poster>brickses</original_poster>
    <original_post>The fundamental virtue of the stock market to the economy is that it:

* Allows any person to easily invest their wealth in capital ventures for profit (the basis of our capitalist society).
* Efficiently grants the leverage to secure capital to the firms which investors believe have the most propensity to produce value to society.
	
Imposing even the most drastic regulatory constraints on the market would not fundamentally impact these benefits, and would only impact the ability of traders to extract arbitrage out of the market at the expense of other investors.

Liquidity has no significant inherent value to the stock market in terms of it's value to the economy as a whole.

Prohibiting the use of all speculative instruments/derivatives and imposing small per-trade tax would not negatively impact the stock market in it's value to most people, it would reduce the volatility of the market and the likelihood of national or global market events, and if anything it would increase the returns of low risk index funds and value investments.</original_post>

    <text>I brought up this point on my thread so I'll bring it up here: "Regulation" does not necessarily mean governmental regulation. For example, Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, etc. prohibiting users from buying GameStop stock is a form of regulation imposed on the market, and a fairly drastic one. 

So, based on your stance in your original post, it seems like you would support that decision. If you don't, why? And if you do support that, do you also believe that it will benefit the economy as a whole?</text>
