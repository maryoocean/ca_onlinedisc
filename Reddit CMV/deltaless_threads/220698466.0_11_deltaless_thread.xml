    <title>CMV: Saying you don't care about freedom of privacy because you have nothing to hide is like saying you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say.</title>

    <original_post>I've argued about this with a girlfriend a couple times now. I believe that the freedom of privacy is a kind of pillar of American freedom, along with life, expression, etc. If we do not have privacy we have lost among our most basic of rights. Her argument is that it doesn't matter if we've lost them, because the government (see: any vested interest with control in mind) will just spy in you anyway, even after they've been caught (see: Snowden) because they can always find ways to do it without people knowing. My rebuttal is that the battle isn't over until you say it's over, quite literally in this case, because their only threat is us, the people who do want a right to privacy.

I use the free speech comparison because similar things happen when the rights are infringed upon. If your freedom of speech is taken away, you no longer have the ability to voice opposition. This would result in anybody who is for free speech will be impossible to find. It's somewhat similar to what happens today with social media hugboxes, the opposition gets harder and harder to find, sounds more and more crazy with each day. It's pretty obvious where this leads. I compare this to right to privacy because too much surveillance means somebody is more hesitant to do natural things, like criticize those in power. Especially when your country is like the USA which has a long history with torture, but that's another story. 

The point is, I understand that the idea that we have privacy in this age is laughable, but that very idea is exactly why you can't just roll over for it. It's a constant battle that must be fought; it's somewhat unfortunate that it's that way, but always revel in the fact that those rights even exist in your mind because without them, you'd have no idea what you're missing out on.

Feel free to ignore the rambling and just try to sway me. I am open to thoughts and opinions on this topic, embrace the ability to even have this discussion.

    <text>The question I always want to ask unwavering privacy advocates is whether or not you've considered worse case scenarios.  There absolutely is a trade off.  Would tolerate a number of foreign attacks on the country in exchange for privacy?  If that number somehow became 10,000 deaths per year, would you reconsider?  You may say I'm full of it, but theoretically, imagine a fleet of drones equipped with automatic weapons fly into Times Square and shoot 10,000 people.  That would drastically change the political climate and it seems plausible if not inevitable to me.   Its like the question of gun violence.  Is a certain amount tolerable?  Are you in favor of allowing organizations to amass weaponry and openly discuss the destruction of the country?  I do believe we *need* some kind of vote or hard conversation, but I do think there is a valid debate to have, unlike with speech.

Curbing freedom of speech = Domestic security from mobs.

Curbing freedom of privacy = Foreign security from individuals.

I know there is overlap, but this is obviously what is going on in someone's mind when they distinguish between the two and you haven't addressed this.  Worse case in allowing total freedom of speech is internal anarchy.  But we are fairly confident in our fellow Americans.  Right now our external violent threat is a thousand times greater than an internal political one and privacy, not speech, addresses external threat.</text>
