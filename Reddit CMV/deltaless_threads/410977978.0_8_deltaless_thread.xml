    <title>CMV: I have no faith in humanity and we all deserve to go extinct.</title>

    <original_post>I don't even know exactly what to say about anything in relation to this topic. Now, I have no experience of any actual human beings physically hurting me or anything else that would typically make someone lose faith in humanity, but what they did collectively was enough to make ME do so!

First, and most importantly, the election of Donald Trump. Ever since the beginning of his campaign, my parents had been constantly talking about how Trump was so stupid that there would be absolutely no chance that he would win the election based on how people really do think, and based on that, I made a vow to myself that I would lose faith in humanity if he won. I did. I now believe that humanity needs and deserves to go extinct because of this.

But that's not the only reason why I believe we all need and deserve to go extinct. The other reason is the inevitable box office success of The Emoji Movie. Ever since its ANNOUNCEMENT, I thought that it was the worst idea in the history of movies and even the greatest amount of care put into it would still make me never want to watch it. Well, obviously the movie did not have any effort at all, and nearly nobody liked it. I was really very happy about that. But the thing that made me double down on my belief of humanity's extinction being deserved was the fact that it will become a box office hit!

I can't think of any other examples I have gone through right now, but I hope you get what I'm saying! I actually don't care if the World War I Christmas Truce makes someone else restore faith in humanity, or any of the other "being kind to your enemies" scenarios in big-name wars did the same, or anything else that would restore faith in humanity. The fact still remains...

How could humanity be so goddamn STUPID!!! First, the election of a bully, troll, and CRIMINAL as President of the United States, and now the inevitable box office success of the worst idea in the history of movies, which will result in other equally bad ideas like "Damn Daniel: The Movie"!

As a result, we DESPERATELY need to go extinct! We fucking deserve it!</original_post>

    <text>I totally get where you are coming from.  I have been musing about this issue myself lately, whether life - human life in particular - is a 'good thing'.  I think so far it is a close call.  Trump definitely makes me feel demoralised and I think he has that affect on lots of people worldwide.  

When you take into account our history, which is basically a list of wars and horrific brutality, with the occasional positive even like a medical breakthrough or international peace treaty.

Overall I think life is improving.  We were bacteria, that as far as we know aren't even capable of being happy and had no concept of morality.  Then we evolved into organisms of increasing complexity.

Life is getting more intelligent through evolution.  It is also increasing in lifespan (most animals live much shorter lives than humans and there used to only be animals).  I think it is also getting happier.  Worldwide, war deaths are down dramatically and lifespan and quality if life have improved a lot in the post WW2 era and in the centuries before that there were improvements too in medicine and technology.

Think of the wonders of modern civilisation.  Decades of music available for free complete with video.  Centuries of wonderful literature, incredible technological leaps and lots of hope for future advancements.  Big jumps in medicine.  Big steps in social justice and freedom.  We are rising.  Just imagine how good the future could be if we carry on.  We could colonise multiple planets, have a Star Trek like future exploring the Universe with prosperity and freedom for all, only it would be even better because we can have brains enhanced by AI.

All in all if you look at the entire history of life, I would say it's either neutral or leaning toward being slightly positive.  But things do seem to be on an upward gradient so if we can keep going things should keep getting better.  Eventually things can be amazing.  

We can build a higher civilisation.  That is my solemn belief and I want to contribute all I can to help move us forward.  There is a solution to every problem and WE CAN DO IT! :D</text>
