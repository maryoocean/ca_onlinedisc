    <title>Women are the inferior gender. CMV</title>
    <original_poster>TyKillsTyGoT</original_poster>
    <original_post>This is an issue I have really struggled with since adolescence and would love to have my views changed. I'm sexist. No bones about it. I know that I should think women are equal and holding these views makes me less civilized, but I haven't been able to find any evidence that would change my mind. 

The smartest people are men. The strongest people are men. It seems like women are average while men can excel or fail spectacularly. Harvard president Larry Summers agrees that men are better suited for certain difficult tasks.

I really want to be able to look at women as people but whenever I see a pretty woman in a nice car, I automatically assume someone bought it for her. When I see a woman out shopping, I wonder what her spouse does to afford her these priveledges. 

The women in my life seem to support this hypothesis. I know some girls who are very smart, but they're not on the level of the smartest guys I know. I also know some girls who are very physically fit but once again they cant compare to the fit men I know and research agrees with both of these points. 

I want to get over this beleif because I feel like it is tainting all my interactions with women and as a result the view is being reinforced more and more each day. 

So please reddit, CMV.</original_post>

    <text>The problem is that you have defined "better" too narrowly.  All of us are good at different things and the things which distinguish us from other creatures don't stop at strength and intelligence.  Even then, we are physically weaker than many other species on the planet and the definition and methods of measuring intelligence changes constantly.  Your view of "male intelligence" being better is tainted by centuries of living in a patriarchical society and being able to lift heavy objects isn't the be all and end all of physical fitness (and it isn't necessarily what makes an individual better than any other).</text>
