    <original_post>I think all governments should be based on individual liberty and democracy. And statism, monarchy, autocracy, and dictatorships are ALWAYS bad.

I'm not going to elaborate on exactly why I think so, at least not here, I just want you to argue why I'm wrong.</original_post>

    <text>Why not see the functioning of 'democratic' forms of government today. 

We see, in the Western Europe and USA a very odd type of system where the illusion of the people's choice is exploited to the maximum by lobbyists, banksters and powerful Presidents. 

How many times do the people actually win in the democracy of today? 

While, on the contrary, there have been many successful governments based on different forms of organisation. There have been kings who have fueled prosperity and virtue, while there have also been oligarchies, and societies which are not based on discrimination, like sanghas. They were all successful for their own period of time and most importantly satisfied the aspirations of the people. There will be a period of time in the future when the democratic system breaks down, and people (and institutions) will have to evolve with the times. This is because there is always an 'anti-incumbency' factor when times get tough.

It cannot be said that there is 'no good alternative' to it. But it may be the best out of what choice we have today. </text>
