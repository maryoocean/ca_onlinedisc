    <title>CMV: Why isn't Wonder Woman sexist?</title>
    <original_poster>BottomOfTheNinth</original_poster>
    <original_post>Most of what I hear and see about Wonder Woman leads me to believe she's sexist. In the depictions I've seen of her she comes from a society that banished men, she seems to be surprised when men are good (and on the opposite side of things, surprised when women are evil) and generally can't go five minutes without calling men dicks because her dad was an asshole.

To clarify, this isn't some men's rights post. I don't care on some kind of personal level if she is or isn't sexist, I just kind of want it clarified for me because a lot of people say she isn't sexist - yet in the examples I've seen of her (the Justice League cartoon, the animated Wonder Woman film, the Flashpoint comic book series...) she pretty much just hates men in general. A lot of people have also told me that while Wonder Woman herself isn't sexist, the Amazons are, so I could kind of do with that being explained too.</original_post>

Given that Wonder Woman did not have a father till 2011, I'm curious where you saw here acting like this.</text>

    <text>The Wonder Woman film, but on closer inspection it would appear he's not her dad in that film. I guess I just got confused because Hades in Justice League Unlimited (who I assume is meant to be Ares' animated counterpart) was revealed to be Wonder Woman's father. I assumed this was canon for the comic series, but supposedly not.</text>

    <text>When I made that post, I forgot that the JL cartoon had made Hades her Father.

In the comics, she was a clay doll brought to life after her baby-crazy mom begged the Gods too make her living. Now she is the product of a secret, adulterous love between Hyploytta and Zeus. I very much prefer it.

Also, bear in mind, when it comes to the Amazons, Diana tends to be an outlier in terms of how she treats men, and her relationships with men has caused her numerous conflicts with her people.</text>

    <text>If I'm honest, the reason I asked the question is because I've barely read any WW comics. But I've seen her in numerous other forms of media, from films to TV series and video games to fan made videos. In a lot of ways I assumed she isn't actually sexist, but the forms of media I've seen her in always seem to showcase her origin story - not her time after she left Themyscira and became her own character.

So basically, it's an admittance of ignorance on my part. Opposed to spending months and a shit load of money reading WW's series, I just kinda wanted people who have read her own comic book to outline why exactly I'm wrong.</text>

    <text>No need to apologize. WW is an icon, but she isn't a very popular character, and doesn't have the presence within pop culture that Superman and Batman do, so ignorance of her is understandable.</text>
