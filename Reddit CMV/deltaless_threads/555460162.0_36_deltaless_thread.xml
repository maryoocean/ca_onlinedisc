    <title>CMV: Most people are not well read enough to reasonably advocate for political or economic change</title>

    <original_post>**Edit: "Well read" was a poor choice of words. I think "have done their due diligence" might be more accurate.**

I'm writing this because I want to be proven wrong, because people saying political things, especially as if obvious has started to annoy and anger me more. Especially if they're making fun of someone for their political views, even if I disagree with those views. I hate feeling angry, so hopefully writing my thoughts out will help.

In trying to figure out my own political views, I've come to realize that I can't reasonably hold the views I held, or any other views. I studied economics, mainly the school of thought that appealed to me. But then more and more I came to realize that I couldn't say if the Keynesian or post-keynesian or the Chicago school or MMT etc. were correct, and that even people who devote their lives to the study of economics struggle with the same thing. The same thing happened in philosophy, especially as I came to realize the importance of epistemology and ontology.

And you can't reasonably expect people to put in the effort and time that it takes to sort through these fields. And that there is still such debate among the experts that even if you become and expert, the truth will not be obvious. I've come to understand what Socrates meant when he said something like "I only know that I know nothing".

I've also come to believe that people hold the beliefs they do more for social reasons. Less for the truth of the beliefs, but more because their reaffirm their identity, and their social bonds.

I can't blame them for that, or for not spending thousands of hours sorting through political thought, philosophy and economics. But a part of me still believes that they haven't done their due diligence, and I get angry that they can affirm themselves and their beliefs, while I sit here uncertain, unable to succinctly articulate why, or how to get this across properly.</original_post>

    <text>I think the problem with this view comes down to this question; When ***IS*** someone well read enough to advocate for political or economic change? In the Jim Crow era the reason given for why black people shouldn't be allowed to vote was because they were illiterate. If you go even further back, illiteracy was used as a justification for slavery. I don't think anyone would argue that these examples weren't informed enough to fight for their human rights, an inherently political cause.

I'm not saying that education or self education are bad things, just that the lack of such doesn't inherently relegate you to not being able to have an opinion.</text>

    <text>I'm not saying "I should be allowed to advocate for change, and other people shouldn't". Well read was a poor choice of words, because while I am pretty well read, I mostly know what I don't know. If you forced to categorize people like that, I'm not sure that I would make the cut.

    <text>I never said you said you would make the cut. Only that a lack of doesn't and shouldn't disqualify someone from advocating for what they believe are best for them.</text>
