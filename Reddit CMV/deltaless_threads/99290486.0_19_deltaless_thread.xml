    <title>I believe that if Washington can have the Redskins, I can have a team called the Black People. CMV</title>

    <original_post>I feel that many people would be offended if a city had a sports team that was called the [insert city] Black People, or even The Blacks, with their logo being a black man's head. However, people (for the most part) accept the fact that the Washington Redskins have all of those same elements, except with a Native American.

 I know that in the past, and perhaps even currently, there has been a movement to get these Native American team names changed, but as we know, mostly nothing has come of this. I feel like if I made a team whose mascot was a black man, that team would receive such outrage that it would never survive. But if the Redskins can exist, the Black People should also be able to exist. CMV.</original_post>

    <text>While I might particularly be offended if there were a sports team called the Honkies, Crackers, Micks, or even care in the least about the Vikings (aside from the team is terrible and always loses, Minnesotan here) I think a lot of other people reserve the right to get their nuts in a twist over just about anything and when it comes to race you are just asking for trouble. Go up to some natives and use the word red skin sometime and let me know how that goes.</text>
