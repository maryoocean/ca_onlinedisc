    <title>CMV: We could better manage agricultural resources if safe appetite suppressants were recommended (even supplied) by the FDA.</title>
    <original_poster>Soycrates</original_poster>
    <original_post>If the government began to suggest that appetite suppressants were a normal, healthy, and even recommended part of the daily diet for teens and adults of all ages (save extreme seniority), we would consume less agricultural resources on average, learn to better manage these resources to reduce starvation and hunger (when applied with humanitarian interest groups), the US populace would spend less money on healthcare, and people would choose their meals more wisely, opting for fresh and non-greasy food choices.

This is not motivated by a hatred or disdain for the image of people considered overweight or obese - some people would still appear to be overweight due to genetic and environmental factors, as well as the possibility for lack of exercise - and should not be considered a "the world would be better without fat people" opinion. The world would be better if we could learn to eat primarily for sustenance instead of pleasure. [Being overweight has been identified as a cause of cancer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight#Health_effects), and is projected to overtake smoking as the primary cause of cancer in developed countries as cases of cancer linked to smoking dwindle. Our health and finances would greatly improve.

We would reduce the amount of environmental damage that is caused by the agricultural industries as well, preserving land and water and creating a culture that could more easily foster eco-friendly practices and biodiversity.

The only people not expected to take appetite suppressants would be those whose RMR (Resting Metabolic Rate) was below normal.

    <text>Overeating is not a problem with food resources. Our distribution model is.

As long as anyone profits from the production and distribution of food(or anything), and their exception from externalities, our resources will continue to be "managed" as they are.</text>

    <text>Both our distribution model and our general views about consumption are flawed. The amount people eat for pleasure or eat after they are full may not be the leading problem in food security, but it certainly doesn't help.

The fact is that it doesn't *have* to be the leading problem in order for someone to want to fix it.</text>
