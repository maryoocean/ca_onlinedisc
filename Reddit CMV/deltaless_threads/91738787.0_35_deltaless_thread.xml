    <title>Women are the inferior gender. CMV</title>
    <original_poster>TyKillsTyGoT</original_poster>
    <original_post>This is an issue I have really struggled with since adolescence and would love to have my views changed. I'm sexist. No bones about it. I know that I should think women are equal and holding these views makes me less civilized, but I haven't been able to find any evidence that would change my mind. 

The smartest people are men. The strongest people are men. It seems like women are average while men can excel or fail spectacularly. Harvard president Larry Summers agrees that men are better suited for certain difficult tasks.

I really want to be able to look at women as people but whenever I see a pretty woman in a nice car, I automatically assume someone bought it for her. When I see a woman out shopping, I wonder what her spouse does to afford her these priveledges. 

The women in my life seem to support this hypothesis. I know some girls who are very smart, but they're not on the level of the smartest guys I know. I also know some girls who are very physically fit but once again they cant compare to the fit men I know and research agrees with both of these points. 

I want to get over this beleif because I feel like it is tainting all my interactions with women and as a result the view is being reinforced more and more each day. 

So please reddit, CMV.</original_post>

    <text>The intelligence argument is invalid because it's simply not true, as others have already pointed out.  (The person in the Guinness Book of World Records for highest IQ is a woman.)

As to the rest, you've essentially said that masculine characteristics are superior therefore men are superior because they are more masculine.  That's akin to saying gingers are superior because they have the reddest hair.  Why is physical strength inherently superior?  Are you inferior to an ox?  If you really are sincere about wanting to view women as people, then stop judging them on a scale of maleness and start looking at the ways in which women make the world better.  </text>
