    <title>CMV: There is no compelling reason for me to come out as bisexual to my close friends and family</title>
    <original_poster>LexVeritas</original_poster>
    <original_post>Happy Pride month, all! This is something I've been thinking about for a while and I would love your input. 

I am a cisgender male who is bisexual (probably Kinsey 1-2, significant preference for women) and heteroromantic. While I occasionally enjoy sex with men, I have no interest in emotional or physical intimacy or romance with them--I don't even like kissing guys, basically I'm just into cock. I also enjoy sex with women, and have a strong urge towards intimacy and romance with female partners.

I've come out or mentioned my bisexuality to some acquaintances, mainly random internet strangers and sexual partners of both genders. However, I haven't brought it up with any of my close friends or family members, for the following reasons.

First: my sex life is my business. I haven't told any of my close friends or family members that I like feet either; it's irrelevant to those relationships. 

Second: I have no interest in dating men or i.e. making out with them at bars, and therefore don't feel that being closeted is at all restrictive or oppressive. I will never need to vent about the way a man I'm dating treats me, or about a man I'm crushing on, etc. like I sometimes do with women. 

Third: If I did come out, it would require explanation of all of the above. I really don't feel any need ever to say the words "Hi mom, I'm bisexual but heteroromantic, that means I sometimes like to suck cock but I'm not going to bring any boyfriends home to meet you." I certainly will have this conversation with my eventual spouse because they will be a core part of my sex life, but I don't feel that discussing my sexual preferences with family and friends would be at all liberating or fulfilling. 

EDIT because I forgot to include it: Fourth: The LGBTQ+ "scene" doesn't appeal to me at all. I will happily wear a rainbow shirt and go to a parade and I have many friends of all persuasions, but I'm not interested in putting a rainbow flag at my house or habitually hanging out at gay bars (though I'd have no problem going to one if a group of friends wanted to, and have done so before). Equal rights, preventing discrimination, AIDS research, and safe sex are all important issues to me, but not more so than i.e. climate change, criminal justice reform, or funding education. If I came out, there would be at least implicit pressure to participate in the LGBTQ+ community; I don't consider this a core part of my identity and so don't feel any desire to do so. 

While I'm fully aware that coming out or not is my own choice and prerogative, I am curious to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks all.</original_post>

    <text>One of my best friends from school, I'll call him Mike, was quite successful with the women at high school and had a couple serious relationships. I went to the same University with him so continued to see him very regularly and also lived in the same student house for the next few years. Occasionally, we would all wake up after a night out and it was mentioned that Mike had brought someone home with him the night before, and it was a guy. 

It should go without saying that none of us gave a shit in that respect, but it was naturally a little surprising given what we knew about him and that he'd never said anything. As the months and later years go by there's more times when it was obvious he would get with some guys, and eventually wound up with a boyfriend. Never once said anything about it. Eventually I'm sat with him and some old school friends over a Christmas (none of who have had the benefit of knowing these things that happened at Uni), and one of them asks him if there's any ladies in his life. This is the first time I'm aware of him ever publically saying "well actually..." (he still had a boyfriend at that point). Everyone there obviously just goes "oh cool" and we all get on with our lives.

I really quite admire how he did it actually, because it isn't something that should "need" any kind of declaration. He just went about things as he wanted to and that was that. So if you wanna go for it, do it! The only point of my ramblings is that it does inevitably cause friends etc. some momentary confusion, which will lead to a few slightly-secretive conversations and speculation. It might in a way drag out questions about it, which people not knowing if you're okay with these things being acknowledged or not. It becomes more of a thing to those around you than it would do. None of that is a big deal, but it might just be something you want to take into account.</text>
