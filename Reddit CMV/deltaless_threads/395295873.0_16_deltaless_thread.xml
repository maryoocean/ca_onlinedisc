    <title>CMV: Catholic views of sexual morality are not homophobic</title>
    <original_poster>forgivememia</original_poster>
    <original_post>The Catholic position is this: in order to be moral, sexual acts must be (1) marital, (2) unitive and (3) open to life. 

Homosexual acts are by definition *NOT* open to life, and therefore they are seen as immoral. They are a sin. All heterosexual acts outside of marriage (which most people are guilty of) are *equally* immoral, and also considered a sin. 

This means that the people who engage in these acts are sinners. But *everybody* is a sinner. There's no belief that sinners are by definition 'evil'. Catholics think that homosexual acts are immoral, but we do not hate the people who commit them, and we do not think that homosexuals are evil. 

If you believe that your friend swears too much, or behaves selfishly, you disapprove of these behaviours, but you don't have to hate your friend.

    <text>So you're telling me that Catholics are against married straight couples having sex over the age of ~50 once the woman goes through menopause and can't conceive anymore? And that they're against marriage for people who are infertile? 

Well if that's true, I didn't know that because Catholics don't make a fuss over it the way they do over gay marriage and other gay issues, so that proves they are homophobic. Because two things are both equally against the rules but they only make a fuss about the gay one not the straight one. </text>
