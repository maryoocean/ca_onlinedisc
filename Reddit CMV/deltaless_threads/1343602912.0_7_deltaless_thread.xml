    <title>CMV: The recent Atlantic shootings was not an anti-Asian event.</title>
    <original_poster>MacV_writes</original_poster>
    <original_post>A white man shot six Asian women along with two others in Atlanta. The narrative that has been that this is directly caused by anti-Asian sentiment driven by racist white supremacists stoking bigotry against Asians. To solve this problem, America must truly commit to not being racist, to listen to those in the Asian community, and to teach young white men in particular the privilege they have as well as the deadly effects of toxic masculinity. 

However, there are details that do not fit the narrative. 

A. The shooter said that this was not racially motivated. 

B. The shooter killed a white woman and white man. 

C. While the shooter had shared a post critical of China https://twitter.com/yellokeith/status/1372202427584192513?s=09 it never rose beyond the national condemnation -- and the victims were Korean.

D. White nationalists in particular are well known for their love of Asian peoples and Asian culture, due to their valuation of ethnostates. 

E. Intentionally racist shootings usually come with racist manifestos, shamelessly racist worldviews, racist narratives about how white people are facing oppression. 

F. The #1 systemic discrimination Asian people face is from Progressives championing 'meritocracy is racist' and 'Asians are white-adjacent' inflammatory racial rhetoric, resulting in concrete discriminatory politics targeting Asian people specifically by their race. https://www.newsweek.com/asian-americans-emerging-strong-voice-against-critical-race-theory-opinion-1574503 

G. Criticism of China as a global, hegemonic, communist power is mainstream and not founded on race or xenophobia. 

It is my view Progressivism is a system which converts Trauma into capital. It seems as though these current narratives are forcing an anti-Asian narrative as a politically motivated strategy to appeal to build on this system. People like Trevor Noah believe killing six Asian people necessarily is a racist attack. But that strikes me as intentionally crude analysis. Isn't it racist for us to project all Asians onto China? Aren't we racistly manipulating the narrative when we selectively emphasize race to push politics, especially when said politics advocates for formally discriminating against Asians as "white-adjacent?"</original_post>

    <text>&amp;gt; A. The shooter said that this was not racially motivated.

Most people who perform racially-motivated actions don't consider themselves racist or their actions were motivated by race. It is possible for one to be unaware of one's own biases that motivate action (https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0015575.)  

&amp;gt; B. The shooter killed a white woman and white man.

Just because a small subset of the victims are non-Asian doesn't mean the crime was motivated by racial animus. This would be akin to saying the 9-11 hijackers didn't do 9-11 because they hated America because a subset of the victims were Muslims. Collateral damage is common when it comes to racially-motivated crimes. 

&amp;gt; C. While the shooter had shared a post critical of China https://twitter.com/yellokeith/status/1372202427584192513?s=09 it never rose beyond the national condemnation -- and the victims were Korean.

If anything, his social media posts shows his affect towards China is negative. In the study linked above, negative affect is highly correlational to implicit biases. And how do we know the shooter knew his victims were Korean rather than Chinese? Did they exclaim it to him during the event? Even if so, the nationality of the victims doesn't matter because both Chinese and Koreans are subsets of Asian cultures. I would find it hard to believe that the shooter had the cognitive awareness to separate Chinese from Korean individuals.  

&amp;gt; D. White nationalists in particular are well known for their love of Asian peoples and Asian culture, due to their valuation of ethnostates.

One doesn't have to be a white nationalist to commit a racially-motivated crime. There are several historical instances in which non-white nationalists committed racially-motivated crimes (e.g. the Holocaust and the German citizenry, urban lynchings in the early 20th century, murders, etc.).

&amp;gt; E. Intentionally racist shootings usually come with racist manifestos, shamelessly racist worldviews, racist narratives about how white people are facing oppression.

Still not required for this to be a racially-motivated crime. Not all racists are loud and we still know very little about his behavior during his private life.

The #1 systemic discrimination Asian people face is from Progressives championing 'meritocracy is racist' and 'Asians are white-adjacent' inflammatory racial rhetoric, resulting in concrete discriminatory politics targeting Asian people specifically by their race. https://www.newsweek.com/asian-americans-emerging-strong-voice-against-critical-race-theory-opinion-1574503


Has nothing to do with your original assertion other than to insert political opinion.

&amp;gt; G. Criticism of China as a global, hegemonic, communist power is mainstream and not founded on race or xenophobia.

Again, I find it hard to believe the shooter was able to differentiate between subsets of Asian cultures. Your linked social media post also reveals that the shooter held strong negative opinions about China based around a theory that has little evidence for support. Why was he motivated to support such a theory? Would he have held the same theory had for instance the virus originated in Russia? If so, would he have been as vehemently opposed to Russia? 

I think it is too early to determine if this was a racially motivated crime or not as we have not seen all of the evidence. But considering the shooter had negative animus towards China, the victims were overwhelmingly Asian, and the shooter targeted an industry relatively known to hire a larger proportion of Asian workers, it would be feckless to not investigate if this had any threads in racism.</text>

That's fair. That opens the possibility that it could be subconscious. But, obviously it's problematic to portray this as the primary motivation and story, over the conscious and tangible explanation, which is incel shit.

This would be akin to saying the 9-11 hijackers didn't do 9-11 because they hated America because a subset of the victims were Muslims. Collateral damage is common when it comes to racially-motivated crimes.

The 9-11 hijackers had an explicit motive and objective (which we could argue, succeeded .. America has been in decline since.) If this was a racially intent attack fueled by anti-China rhetoric, wouldn't he just go to Chinatown? Can we say that this was a pro-Black event, given he killed no Black people? Outcomes are not causations.

&amp;gt;If anything, his social media posts shows his affect towards China is negative. In the study linked above, negative affect is highly correlational to implicit biases.

It's easy to go to Chinatown. 

&amp;gt;One doesn't have to be a white nationalist to commit a racially-motivated crime. There are several historical instances in which non-white nationalists committed racially-motivated crimes (e.g. the Holocaust and the German citizenry, urban lynchings in the early 20th century, murders, etc.).

That's true. But it is a solid counterpoint that the racist rightwingers love Asians. 

&amp;gt;Still not required for this to be a racially-motivated crime. Not all racists are loud and we still know very little about his behavior during his private life.

It points to an emotionally sparked event, not pre-mediated. In which case incel shit is the primary motivation.

&amp;gt;Has nothing to do with your original assertion other than to insert political opinion.

The current narratives being formed around this are propping up racial rhetoric _against Asians._ It's a white supremacist country right? It just so happens that view formally discriminates against Asians as "white adjacent."

&amp;gt;Again, I find it hard to believe the shooter was able to differentiate between subsets of Asian cultures.

A crude, low IQ racist shooter could be. But all signs are pointing to unintentional racial component which at most is subconscious.</text>

It is most certainly a confluence of factors that led to the shooter's actions. As most of us know, the people who cover this case in the short-term pre-trial will sensationalize it because that offers greater profit. But I don't think just because the media overblows the race factor, law enforcement shouldn't follow any leads they find.

True. Outcomes are not causation. Which puts forth the equivalent conclusion that the inclusion of non-Asian victims can't rule out this not being a crime motivated by race. I think we both agree here that no conclusion can be put forth now. But that doesn't close the door towards investigating whether or not this has ties to race. 

&amp;gt; It's easy to go to Chinatown. 

What non-verbal characteristics do China-born individuals have that clearly differentiate them from Korean-born individuals in the context of a workplace giving services to the public? 

&amp;gt;One doesn't have to be a white nationalist to commit a racially-motivated crime. There are several historical instances in which non-white nationalists committed racially-motivated crimes (e.g. the Holocaust and the German citizenry, urban lynchings in the early 20th century, murders, etc.). 

Do you have any sources for white nationalist affinity for Asian culture? Furthermore, wouldn't white nationalists loving Asian culture and the shooter not being a white nationalist give more support for this to be racially motivated? 

&amp;gt; It points to an emotionally sparked event, not pre-mediated. In which case incel shit is the primary motivation. 

Emotionally-sparked events encapsulate a lot of racially motivated crimes. An Indian was just recently killed in KC after only annoying a white bar patron. The Tulsa riots were emotionally-sparked. Emmet Till's murder was emotionally-sparked. 

&amp;gt; The current narratives being formed around this are propping up racial rhetoric _against Asians._ It's a white supremacist country right? It just so happens that view formally discriminates against Asians as "white adjacent." 

If America considers Asians "white adjacent", then why were they interned in camps during WW2? Why are they using the institutional court system to put forth a rather successful court case? If they were white adjacent, wouldn't they have failed to make their case in District Court? Furthermore, wouldn't there be a stark difference in the geospatial distribution of Asian Americans since they would have the same opportunities as whites? Again, this ignores the several instances of hate crime against Asians since the Chinese Exclusions Axts.


&amp;gt; A crude, low IQ racist shooter could be. But all signs are pointing to unintentional racial component which at most is subconscious. 

Intentional or unintentional, isn't an outcome that changes only due to the factor of race the definition of racism?</text>

    <text>I’ve honestly never heard of Asians being considered “white adjacent”, and I am very political. I don’t know why you think that is as prevalent a belief as you’re making it out to be.</text>

Isn't it incredibly more specific that they were all prostitutes though? There's plenty of asian places in any big city that aren't brothels, and every single place he shot up was a brothel. I feel like this is one of those cases that is so obviously not racially motivated that it shows this strange, creepy need people have for racism to be prevalent. Them being asian was like the lowest level thing they had in common.</text>
