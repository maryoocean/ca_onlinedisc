    <title>CMV: women are not going for the 'upper tier' of men</title>
    <original_poster>BadgerSame6600</original_poster>
    <original_post>I see this rhetoric over and over and over online, and hear it IRL sometimes.  It drives me crazy tbh. I am a man out in the world, living life, 35 years of it now. I have friends who are all over the spectrum of physical attractiveness. Some are single, most aren't. Their gfs/wifes are also across the spectrum. In most couples I know, friends and acquaintances,  the woman is better looking, earns more, or has more social skills ect. 

Now I know this is my experience, so it is anecdotal, but at the same time I just don't buy this whole women are too choosy. My opinion is that the dudes who say this are refusing to address their flaws and accept them. If these men believe this and they go out into the world feeling hard done by, fighting a losing battle, then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Most people can smell that level of victimhood a mile of. 

OK, open to have this challenge, so- change my view, Redditors! </original_post>

    <text>I exclude men based on criteria independant of what I tell them. I'm not going to tell you that I'm swiping left because 

1) You're holding a fish
2) You watch Joe Rogan
3) You think Andrew Tate has some good points.
4) You make the asinine comment of "I'm looking for my partner in crime" (Every other guy profile, seriously men, try to not be so god damn cookie cutter).

I'm not looking for top tier, I'm just not going to scrape the bottom of the barrel when there are plenty of other men out there.</text>
