    <title>In the Israel v. Palestine conflict, Israel is by far in the wrong and the US should cut ties with the country. CMV</title>

    <original_post>It seems all that I've seen about the conflict, is Israel either taking over Palestinian territory that isn't rightfully there's, imprisoning innocent Palestinian people, and making Palestine out to be the bad guys.

To me, it seems like all of the violence caused by Palestine is just an attempt to raise attention to their cause. I would necessarily agree with that, but their point is still valid.

    <text>I will agree with you: Israel is in the wrong.  West Bank settlements, displacing and abusing the Arabs is all very wrong.  There should be a Muslim Palestinian state, on good terms with Israel, for those wishing to keep to their traditional lifestyle, and those Arab Muslims who want to assimilate into the western lifestyle in Israel should be allowed to do so and gain Israeli citizenship.

But what led Israel to be in the wrong? The Middle East conflict is extremely difficult to explain, as the two “sides” are actually split into different factions. But let’s start with the creation of the State of Israel in 1948.

Upon its creation, Israel was completely (and still is partyl) surrounded by hostile states, and it contains a people that were traditionally despised not only in Europe but also in the Arab Peninsula; with the rise of both Arab nationalism (Nasser etc.) and Islamism, it became even more unsafe to be a Jew in an Arab country. Hence, Operation Magic Carpet, to get Arab Jews into Israel, is win-win; Israel gets more Jews to populate their new country, and Jews are kept safe.

The result of being surrounded by hostile states is, however, nationalism and a desire to fight, often violently, for your existence. Israel gains the West Bank in 1967; it wins the Yom Kippur War in 1973; it invades Lebanon. Nationalism thrives on conflict, and indeed, Adam Curtis cites this as a reason why Hamas and Israeli nationalists need each other in order to survive; if Oslo had been a success, things may have turned out differently.

But to cut off a country diplomatically is bad news, the worst thing you can do to a country and it is the absolute last resort. The result of cutting off Israel would be a ramping-up of all the abuses and tensions that are currently a problem. North Korea is a good example of a country becoming even more unruly as even China tries to distance itself from it.
