    <title>CMV: Album art that solely consists of a portrait photograph of the artist's or artists' face(s) without any interesting makeup is boring, lazy, and uninteresting.</title>

    <original_post>Examples: Phil Collins's [*Face Value*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c9/Phil_Collins_-_Face_Value.png/220px-Phil_Collins_-_Face_Value.png), [*No Jacket Required*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2f/Phil_Collins_-_No_Jacket_Required.png), [*...But Seriously*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f5/Phil_Collins-But_Seriously.jpg)


Taylor Swift's entire discography




Album art serves important functions- to draw a newcomer in and to be aesthetically pleasing. A good album cover ought to tantalize a listener and make them listen to the record.  It can  convey the tone and content of the album "loudly" with blunt and bold symbolism, or it can be mysterious and subtly hint at the content with a minimalist design.


 Additionally, it should be aesthetically appealing to some degree. This is important if you own a physical copy of the album, whether it be vinyl or cd, as it encourages you to preserve the quality of the casing. Additionally, it can be appreciated as you would appreciate any other piece of art. It also makes the band look more serious and professional about their work.



In my opinion, the portrait album covers I provided as examples have none of these qualities. First of all, they don't necessarily stick out. If it wasn't for Collins's and Swift's fame, these records could easily be passed over in a record store. They don't have any unique or noteworthy qualities to them- they're quite vanilla and inoffensive. It's just someone's face without any particular unique makeup or costume. Additionally, they're quite boring to look at. 


Secondly, it's hard to discern the tone and content of the album. Phil Collins seems to be donning a neutral expression in many of the album covers. This obviously makes it hard to determine what kind of music is going to be in the album.



I added the "makeup" caveat as it actually can make portrait covers interesting. Just look at Bowie's *Hunky Dory* and *Aladdin Sane*

    <text>You could make a solid argument that if an album is good enough, it doesn't need to stoop to attractive or eye-catching packaging in order to sell.  The music itself will simply find the listeners and draw them in.  The best music is art, and the worst music is nothing more than a product.  Products needs packaging.  Art does not need packaging.</text>

    <text>True, but good album art attracts a new listener that has never heard of the band. It piques their interest to an extent.</text>

    <text>The Beatles released the white album with no cover at all, and it's one of the best albums of all time.  New listeners who only want to buy music because the album art caught their eye, are listeners who are looking for products, not looking for art.

The crux of your argument is basically "artists should stop being artists and get more into salesmanship and gimmicks.  Be less like Leonardo DaVinci, and more like PT Barnum."</text>

The lack of anything on the White Albums cover actually makes it stand out more than anything else. A plain face on an album cover looks overly generic when you are flipping through a bunch of albums. The white album however stands out among other albums when you are flipping through for the sole reason it is just a plain white.</text>
