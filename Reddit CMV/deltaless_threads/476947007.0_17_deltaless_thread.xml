    <title>CMV: Either political beliefs should be a protected class, or religious beliefs should not be a protected class</title>
    <original_poster>IJerkOffToSlutwalks</original_poster>
    <original_post>I am doing this CMV because I believe there is an ideological inconsistency in America when it comes to the concept of a protected class. The core of my view is that political affiliation and religious affiliation should be treated in the same when it comes to protected classes, regardless of what the classification actually is. In other words, I don’t really care if they are protected classes or they aren’t, but they at least should be the same. 

Here is a list of all the protected classes in America. 

- Race
- Color
- Religion or creed
- National origin or ancestry
- Sex
- Age
- Physical or mental disability
- Veteran status
- Genetic information
- Citizenship

Most of these classes have something in common - they are things that you are unable to change about yourself. For example, no one chooses where they were born, you’re just stuck with what you got. However, there is one notable exception in this list; religion. 

A person can choose their religion. They can switch religions or abandon religion altogether. It is my belief that the reason that religion is a protected class is because religious beliefs, while changeable, tend to be a very fundamental part of a person’s identity and changing religions isn’t something that people do on a whim. 

I believe that political beliefs are just like this. They tend to be a very fundamental part of a person’s identity, and they tend to not change on a whim.

I believe that this is a double standard that should be corrected. What I’m saying specifically is this: if I can’t hang a sign on my business that says “no Muslims” then I also shouldn’t be allowed to hang a sign that says “no Republicans”. Similarly, if I am allowed to hang a “no Republicans” sign, I should also be allowed to hang a “no Muslims” sign. 

To change my view, you must convince me that there is a fundamental difference between political and religious beliefs that warrants the apparent double standard in our protected class system. If you can draw a convincing distinction between the two, that will change my view. </original_post>

You're both very close and very far away.

You should read about Jeffersons [statute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Statute_for_Religious_Freedom) for Religious Freedom for context.  You will come to find your definition of 'protected class' is... slightly off and, in fact, not at all applicable here.

Historically it has not been the case that people can simply "choose their religion" and, even under our present system, they sometimes pay a price for doing so.  For very wide swaths of the remainder of the planet, that fact remains true.    Henry the VIII made himself both head of church and head of state and thereby inaugurated several centuries of formal and deliberate administration of anti-Catholic oppression.   He was not an innovator in this, having seen generations of Catholic Popes administer similar anti-Jewish oppression for all of the previous centuries. 

The point is that governance and religion remain both very important and very powerful forces in the lives of citizenry.  When combined the two forces yield power that is virtually unstoppable and very very easily abused and corrupted.   So the answer is to ensure that they stay separate. 

The very fact that you can say, with a straight face, that people are free to choose religion, or are free to abandon religion altogether, is the most complete affirmation that is possible of the wisdom of our present system.

    <text>Every bit of that is applicable for political beliefs as well. They are deeply held beliefs, historically you couldn’t just always speak your mind about the government, you still can face consequences for them if you make them known to your friends and family, etc. 

I don’t disagree with anything here but I think it all equally applies to politics. </text>
