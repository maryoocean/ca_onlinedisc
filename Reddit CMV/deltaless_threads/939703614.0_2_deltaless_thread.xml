    <title>CMV: Where your born doesn't matter and country pride is pointless</title>
    <original_poster>Blank-VII</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't think I belong to a country and I think the concept is odd. I was born in the UK and have lived here all my life, but I fail to understand why people are so hard-core about being a 'proud brit' or anything. Where I was born isn't something I was able to decide for myself, and I want my life to be what I make out of it, not what it decides for me. I believe the only way to belong to a country is to find one whose culture is similar to your own tastes and opinions, and to move there. What's the point in being proud of a country I was born in if I feel no attachment to how it's run or anything else?

*you're

*View partially changed. Country pride is not pointless.

**Main view unchanged, it seems no-one can quite convince me. I've had some fantastic conversations and I'm really happy with how many of you engaged without being toxic. Stay safe y'all. Thanks so much!**</original_post>

    <text>Here in the US, a lot of immigrants arrive to find new economic opportunity, but that doesn’t mean they just forget about their country of origin.

Perhaps their original country is what they associate with their family, way of life, food, traditions, music, etc. Those things can be a very comforting thought once you start in a new place and they are removed from your experience.

If those positive aspects make up a great aspect of one’s identity, they may choose to embrace that aspect, and even may enjoy the thought of sharing their culture with others who are not familiar.

I am an immigrant, and even people I meet from other countries are excited to invite me to travel to their home country so I can taste their food, see their monuments, listen to their music, etc. It’s natural to feel a connection to the world that you grow up in. It feels good to have a sense of belonging to a community, and share that belonging with others.</text>

Very good point. I have nothing but happiness to share with people that have strong ties to their country, but I also believe that experience - while being a huge contributing factor to you as a person - shouldn't entirely define you. Mostly because there will always be more experiences! For example, what if I was Mexican, I have a great family, our traditions are great fun and I have a fantastic childhood, but then discover technology is something I want to pursue. I immigrate to America and go to uni (far fetcher I know but bear with me) to study space or something high-tier that your average Mexican citizen might not be able to do. Let's say I find that far more enjoyable and superior to my family's way of life. Let's say I start loving American culture, food, traditions etc. Let's say I fall in love with the president. All while not forgetting my family and how much I still love them.

Phew! That was pushing it to the extreme, but I can sum up my point with 'Why can't I love everything and call myself a Mexican, American, Brit, Canadian etc. all at once? I love all the cultures, why are people still labeling me as a Mexican?'</text>
