    <original_post>Prayer as an act of reaching to a deity for help or comfort has no appreciable effect beyond what can be achieved by normal positive thinking.

Praying to end world hunger or to get a job has no effect unless you or someone else makes the decision to achieve the goal. These goals could also just as easily be achieved without prayer.

Edit: I do not believe in the non corporeal nature of prayer. I do believe in the effects such as positive thinking giving someone a better understanding of who they are a what they can do.</original_post>

    <text>My point of view is that prayer isn't very different from normal positive thinking. However, it can in many cases be more effective than normal positive thinking. The thing is, everyone has limitations, and no matter how much you try to force yourself to believe, you will have a natural tendency to doubt yourself. When you pray, you're removing the responsibility from yourself. You recognize your own inability to achieve a goal, so you thrust the responsibility onto an all-powerful being who cannot fail and will accept all requests, which, given that you believe in the being, is more believable than you accomplishing the task. And if you believe more, the effects of positive thinking are more powerful.</text>
