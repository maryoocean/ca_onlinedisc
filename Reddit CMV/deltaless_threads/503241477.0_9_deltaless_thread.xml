    <title>CMV: People should not be able to choose a religion until they reach the age of legal adulthood</title>
    <original_poster>PsychoticSoul</original_poster>
    <original_post>Children are about as impressionable as it gets, and getting religious instruction from their parents is, in my opinion, tantamount to brainwashing at the age where they are most susceptible.

Choosing a religion requires the same responsible, mature mind that allows one to vote, drive, drink, choose a political affiliation, etc - so why must those wait until adulthood, but religion can effectively be forced on the young?

By my suggestion I mean:

Instruction regarding religion in all schools must be multi-denominational and as wide as possible, such that a person can make as informed a decision as possible upon reaching adulthood on what path they wish to take.

Religious schools can only accept adults - those who have made the conscious decision to go there.

No religious rituals such as baptism until willingly chosen as an adult.

1. All of the other things among that list are actions, rather than ideology or realization of a belief system. 

2. People under 18 choose a political affiliation all the time. Many teenagers are politically knowledgeable and active. The only thing they have to wait until 18 to do is declare a party affiliation which is different and independent from political ideology, unless you are advocating a registry/formal, necessary declaration of religion, which would definitely be against the first amendment. </text>
