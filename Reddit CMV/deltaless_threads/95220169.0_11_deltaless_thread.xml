    <original_post>I believe that working 40 hours a week is entirely unnecessary for even (and perhaps especially for) technologically advanced first-world countries to thrive.  I feel that it isn't even possible for the majority of people to stay engaged for 8 or 9 hours a day, and that the 80/20 principle applies beautifully here (80 percent of work gets done during 20 percent of the time).

Our technological productivity has outpace our wants and needs to such a vast degree that it seems there are only to reasons justifying such a long work-week:

1-The economic machine needs people to be occupied so that they fall into the consumer mentality and fill up their few remaining hours with purchased items to entertain and fulfill themselves.  If people worked less, even if they were as productive, our economic growth would slow (which ecologically needs to happen, but I suppose can be seen as a negative).

2-Certain endeavors demand 40 hours or more a week.  Athletics, science, writing...but these are passion-based, rather than need-based.

I believe we could live happily in a world where everyone worked 20 hours each week.  CMV

    <text>Lol, I'll tell that to my superiors when I'm a doctor.

"Nah man, we don't need to work 40 hours.  Healthcare will sort itself out or something."

The truth is that some industries need *much more* than 40 hours a week from their employees right now.  Medicine is just one example of that.  We have residents working 80 hours a week in some places, but still haven't caught up to the demand.

Sure, working 40 hours a week is unnecessary if you have job where you can fuck around all day.  Otherwise, your business/company relies on you being productive the vast majority of the time you are on the clock.</text>

    <text>as someone training to be in health care this couldn't be more true. most people in health care are lucky to get a 30 minute lunch break. any down time is spent catching up on paperwork.</text>

    <text>I hear you.  I'm getting (perhaps inarticulately) at the broader point that we have the means to reorganize things to a point where no one has to work that long...granted, it would be a radical reorganization.  I'm just saying that, fundamentally, a 40 hr. workweek is unnecessary.</text>
