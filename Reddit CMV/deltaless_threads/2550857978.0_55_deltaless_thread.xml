    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>The problem is that all cops work for the rich against the poor.

As such most cops are bad people (there will always be exceptions). For proof just ask anyone if their theft or other crime was investigated and dealt with sufficiently, then compare it to a similar crime to a business.

It just so happens to be that the rich are commonly racist and the black are commonly poor, so some common ground is found, but not really important overall.

There may be many good cops or people wanting to be good, but eventually they either get kicked out or overriden to not be good and helpful for long.</text>
