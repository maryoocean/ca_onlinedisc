    <title>CMV: Saying white people in general shouldn't feel guilty for the actions of specific, individual white people isn't an example of white fragility.</title>
    <original_poster>LucidMetal</original_poster>
    <original_post>I was recently banned from /whitepeopletwitter for this comment:

&amp;gt;I don't think "white people" need to feel guilty about this. You're just internalizing an issue over which you don't have control. What we need to do is figure out a way to combat the revisionist history narratives and misinformation that are plaguing conservative spheres (I don't want to say "echo chamber" because let's be honest everyone lives in an echo chamber these days).

I don't care that I was banned to be clear. I do care that the reason seemed incorrect. The reason given was:

&amp;gt;White fragility is racist.

I do believe "white fragility" as a concept exists in America i.e. many white people exhibit a negative reaction including anger, fear, guilt, arguing, silence, or leaving the stress-inducing situation when they encounter discussions of race. I have no idea how pervasive it is because I don't encounter it very frequently but I have encountered it and I know my friends who belong to minority racial groups say it happens frequently for them. 

I don't think the ban was justified (but who cares) and I don't think white fragility is racism (I suppose easy delta here if you can show me why) but I also don't see why my comment is an example of white fragility.

As far as I remember it's the opposite! It was saying OP should not feel guilt when discussing the Buffalo shooter since it was a specific person with a specific worldview not "white people". I can't post the comment I was responding to because it's been deleted but it was along the lines of "white people should feel guilty for the Buffalo shooter".

EDIT: Alright, found the parent using Unddit! This is what I was responding to:

&amp;gt;“My kids shouldn’t feel guilty for slavery two hundred years ago!”

&amp;gt;News flash asshole, they should feel guilty for what happened in the past week.</original_post>

    <text>I suppose the term white fragility used to describe a behavior OP was having that is coined to a general racial behavior (i.e. racism).</text>

    <text>White fragility is a phenomenon, not a stereotype or a generalization. Even if most people didn’t showcase white fragility (which is really just the concept of the majority in power being uncomfortable confronting their privileges as the majority group in power), it would still be a thing.

Feels like a massive stretch to say the concept is racist. Hmm, someone should coin a term for when this kind of thing happens.

sorry, I meant to say that all white people are whiney crybabies who are going to whine and cry about racism strictly because they’re white crybabies</text>

    <text>I think my favorite part about white fragility is how any discussion of it immediately becomes an example.

    <text>No, it’s the crying about how “white fragility” is racist that demonstrates white fragility. You’re free to disagree with the concept all you want. But instead of disagreement I just get people lashing out and angry.

    <text>I’d say by putting white in the term it’s racist. It’s clearly negative and being directly connected to a race. I’d be the same as if we had black fragility referencing black people who got upset over something. Just because something is focused on a truth doesn’t mean it’s not racist and it’s the same for focusing on the main race of a region.</text>

    <text>That's the definition of a catch-22. You can't offer anything that opposes the viewpoint because doing so "affirms" that viewpoint. It's probably not a shocking revelation, but being derided as fragile is not going to elevate a conversation, it'll just drag it into name calling and personal attack.

But that's the goal of the term, so it works.</text>

    <text>I think it’s views by different camps as both an example of white fragility and how white fragility is a dumb term that doesn’t exist. 

I like collecting ideas that are viewed very differently by different groups.

It’s kind of impossible to discuss or debate white fragility because of this feature. If anyone saying “white fragility isn’t real” is viewed as an example of white fragility then how do we know if it exists or if we just think it exists?</text>
    </comment>
  <comment id="39754611677.0" user="mathematics1" delta="False">
    <text>This reminds me of the "defund the police" conversation, where the idea behind it makes sense (direct both funding and responsibilities away from police and send them to other social programs instead) but the term used makes it sound like "cut police funding down to zero", so just the name used generates lots of backlash from people who don't want to eliminate all police funding. The phenomenon you described is real, but calling it "white fragility" makes it sound like a trait that's typical of white people.

I heard someone else give an example that helped clarify this for me: if someone said "I hate black thugs who rob people" they could technically say they are only referring to criminals and not every black person - but they really made it sound like they think most/all black people are criminals, and we would rightfully condemn them for perpetuating racist stereotypes. If you really do intend to say that most/all white people are fragile, then talking about white fragility will get your point across well; if you are describing a phenomenon that applies to some people or some discussions but not most, then calling it white fragility will make people misinterpret you just like they misinterpreted "defund the police".</text>

    <text>The way I understand this post, OP commented on a thread calling out white people in general for some racist act other white people (cops/the buffalo shooter/whoever) have perpetuated. It could be something a bit more nuanced like "check your white privilege", but I get the vibe of "white people racist" or "you should feel ashamed of your race" which is racist.
