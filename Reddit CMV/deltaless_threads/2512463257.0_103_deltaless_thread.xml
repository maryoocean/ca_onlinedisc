    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>Ok, woah woah. Religion doesn't belong in schools? It's not that simple.

Forcing kids to partake in religion, like the primary school I grew up in, which forced us to sing Christian songs every day in assembly? I agree, that doesn't belong in schools.

But allowing kids to express their faith? This doesn't hurt anybody. If you have a problem with another kid in a classroom wearing a hijab or turban, even though it literally doesn't affect you in any way.. that's just entitled. It's their life and not yours. Deal with it.</text>
