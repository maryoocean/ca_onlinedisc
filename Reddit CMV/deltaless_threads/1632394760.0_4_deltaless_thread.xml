    <title>CMV: Space Tourism is a Waste of Resources</title>
    <original_poster>rsirdeshmukh</original_poster>
    <original_post>In 2021, three billionaires, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, and Elon Musk, entered the "space race" to take flight into space with no aim other than to reach suborbital space for a few minutes. 

While much of the world marvelled at this technological milestone, I was taken aback. If these billionaires get their way, there will be many spacecrafts jetting off to space for a joyride. This is scary because the carbon footprint of each of these space expeditions is extremely high due to the amount of fuel they use, the energy used to manufacture the fuel, and the soot generated which pollutes and damages the atmosphere while heating up the earth.

To me, space tourism seems like just an obscene display of power and wealth. With so many problems on earth, such as climate change and the pandemic, their money can be used more productively. Whether that is helping save earth or funding real space research, both are much better than just going up to space for a few minutes. Especially since doing so continues to exacerbate the wealth gap because space tourism is only a reality for those who can afford it while having serious implications on those left on earth.</original_post>

    <text>I'm pro space tourism, but mostly because in order for us ALL to become a spacefaring people, we need to work out all the kinks. SOMEONE has to be the guinea pig, and I'd rather it be the obscenely wealthy than the people who normally get thrown under the bus for the sake of progress. I'm sure there are tons of imperfections in space flight and all of that has to be ironed out before it becomes commonplace.</text>

    <text>Nah it's still normal people being the guinea pigs, as rich people wouldn't board those rockets unless other people have proven them to be safe.</text>
