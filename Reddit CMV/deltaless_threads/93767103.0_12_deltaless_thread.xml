    <title>I believe humans need their rights limited to ensure survival of our species. CMV.</title>

    <original_post>This is something I've believed for a while. As a species, humans are self-destructive. We procreate too much and consume too many resources. I believe that something like China's one-child policy should be instituted in as many countries as possible to curb population growth. ~~I think currency should be done away with and governments should provide housing and necessities while the population works for the betterment and survival of humanity as a whole rather than for monetary compensation.~~

Am I crazy to think this is how the world should be? 

EDIT: Perhaps eliminating currency would be more problematic than keeping it.</original_post>

    <text>I believe right now restricting personal rights to further our survival as a species is a solution looking for a problem. At this point in our history we need to improve on our organization as a whole rather than than refine individual rights. The greatest threats to our overall survival cannot be addressed by limiting the individual. We have enough food to feed everyone, we just need to achieve enough cooperation to do so. We have wondrous technology which allows unprecedented freedoms, but we need to make it sustainable. We have learned to utilize nuclear energy, but we need to make sure we don't decimate the planet with it. These are advances we must make as a species. Unnecessarily limiting personal freedoms only serves to make people's lives worse. Generally we do not need to fight for survival as individuals. The drive behind the individual is to live an enjoyable life. Making it more difficult for people to do so when unnecessary can only be detrimental.
