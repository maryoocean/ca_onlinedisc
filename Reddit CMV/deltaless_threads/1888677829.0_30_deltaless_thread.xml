    <title>CMV: It's stupid to care about the environment in space.</title>
    <original_poster>MostRecommendation84</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm a big proponent of space colonization/exploitation and every time I bring it up there's someone who says something along the lines of "Oh we're gonna trash the Moon like we did Earth?" "Oh good more mining!" "Humanity won't rest until we've exploited everything we can!" and other snide comments to that effect. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Honestly, it just sounds like the dumbest argument to me and I wouldn't even be bothering with a CMV if I hadn't heard it so many times. *It's rocks. Uninhabitable barren rocks floating through vast chunks of literally* ***nothing****.* There's no space squirrels to worry about, we haven't found any aliens and we really have no reason to assume any are out there, let alone that they give a shit what we do to Mercury. Furthermore, you want to stop desertification or the human rights violations of cobalt mining, you're gonna be hard pressed to find a better solution than the absurd volumes of water and cobalt from here to the asteroid belt.</original_post>

    <text>This is the same line of thinking that brought us to the environmental catastrophe we're currently in: "We don't see the effects, so it must not matter."

The problem is that just because we currently cannot see what may cause an impact to the moon or to space, doesn't mean an impact doesn't exist. By the time we develop the tech or science to see and measure the effects, it may be difficult or virtually impossible to clean up.

Just an example, space debris in orbit is already an issue. We literally have trash flying at hundred of miles per hour, in orbit.

Ignoring human impact on any environment is simply negligent procrastination.</text>
