    <title>CMV: there don't need to be hundreds of gender and sexuality names</title>
    <original_poster>YoungRecluse</original_poster>
    <original_post>I can understand gay, lesbian, queer, bisexual, asexual, pansexual, and aromantic. I can understand cis-, trans-, and a-genders. Why does there need to be demisexual and demiromantic and all that? Why do we need so many classifications of gender and sexuality? If you're attracted to the same sex, why can't you just be homosexual? If you're attracted to the opposite why can't you just be heterosexual? If you're attracted to both, why can't you be bisexual? Attracted to all? You're pansexual.
Keep it simple.

Also, I understand people getting offended and angry when they're misgendered, but getting angry doesn't really accomplish anything unless you can be calm in your education on the subject. Hating people for not calling you by your preferred pronouns the first time when they've never met you before is not going to accomplish anything. Hating cisgendered, heterosexual people will not accomplish anything. 

Please change my view.

    <text>I feel like you're arguing against a straw man a bit here.

Are there "hundreds" of gender and sexuality names?  Have you ever met someone who "hated" you for not using their preferred pronouns the first time you met them?

The few people I've met who have "atypical" gender or sexual identities have never made a fuss about it.</text>

    <text>That may be true, that I'm arguing the straw man. 

Hundreds may be a bit of an exaggeration, but I feel like there are too many for society to understand and accept.

I have never met anyone who hated me for not using proper pronouns, but I have not encountered any transgendered/agender people in my lifetime. Most of my "experience" with gender and sexuality is on Tumblr, and I understand that people there can be a little over the top. 

Yes, most people probably won't make a fuss about sex/gender identities, but there are those people who are extremely radical about people accepting their obscure identity.</text>

    <text>The best data you have is that there are people that *appear* to be extremely radical about their obscure identity... on a website known for over-the-top trolling. 

Methinks you have been taken in.</text>

    <text>Gay, straight and bi.

Do i need to know anything beyond that? I feel like if you need to be identified beyond that you are giving me too much information about your sexual preference and your trying to be a special snowflake by pointing it out. Would a straight guy correct you by telling you he wasn't straight and only preferred Dark hair Latina women with strong legs and an indifferent attitude to Italian cusine?

    <text>What if he likes women and MTF transgendered women? Some people wouldn't accept that as being "straight" yet its not really being bi either.</text>

    <text>What part is confusing? A transgendered person is someone who feels they are a different gender than their biologicAl sex. There are clearly two types. Biologically born males who become females (MTF) and biologically born females who become males (FTM)

Many people only recognize transgendered people as the sex they were born, which can complicate identifying someone's sexual preference. </text>

    <text>Trans women are women, trans men are men. There is no complication here.</text>

    <text>I agree with you, however you wouldn't have to look hard to find someone who doesn't.</text>

    <text>No, because transphobia is pervasive. 

It doesn't invalidate it.</text>

    <text>Well things like that are the reason that people have created so many labels to describe their sexuality. </text>

    <text>Go back up the comment train, the whole topic is about why so many labels exist to explain someone's sexuality.

My two cents was, people have created all these labels because there are situations where someone might not feel comfortable identifying with straight or bi.

You don't have to agree but it's still an answer to the question.

If you're just going to jump into a comment train you should probably look at the context first.</text>

    <text>I did. That didn't stop you from making no sense.

There's no complication from someone being binary trans in identifying yourself using any labels you see fit.</text>

    <text>Well, it's ONE example of a reason people may use a term other than straight/gay/bi. I got this straight from my friend who told me after he got tired of arguing with people that he was straight because he had a MTF gf, he got more involved in the LGBT community and found a better label. 

The fact that you disagree with that for whatever reason, doesn't it make it not a reason some people don't identify as gay/straight/bi. </text>

  <comment id="27484152069.0" user="new_aphrodite" delta="False">
    <text>....I don't disagree with people identifying outside that. I have for most of my life.

People who argue that having an MTF girlfriend makes you "not straight" are transphobic, that's all there is to it. Plenty of straight people have trans partners.</text>

    <text>Believe it or not people have different opinions than yours. 

I can guarantee you my friend with his trans girlfriend is Not transphobic. You really sound silly.</text>

  <comment id="27484165365.0" user="new_aphrodite" delta="False">
    <text>Okay? How he identifies doesn't really matter.

It's people telling him that he is not straight because he has a trans girlfriend that is transphobic. That's the source of this and the problem.

That's plain and simple transphobia. "Straight men like women, trans women are not women, therefore men who like trans women are not straight" is essentially the argument here, and it's transphobic. There is no denying that. It doesn't matter if it's their opinion, it's transphobic and incorrect.</text>

    <text>Okay well agree to disagree I guess, like I said I'm not even arguing a point here. I'm giving a single example of why some people don't identify as straight/gay/bi. I don't know if you just don't understand or you just choose not to</text>
