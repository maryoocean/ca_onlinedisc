    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>I really stopped caring what those kinds of European think about in many cases, namely anything pertaining to us as Americans.

To be honest, those kinds of European just want to be part of the cool kids club by bashing anything American, it’s the European thing to do and yes, it is a European hobby.

Next time they give you crap, remind them that we at least make up our mind on our denomination since our country came to be, can’t say the same for them. Are Germans German or Prussian? Are French people French or Gaul? Down to the spelling itself, is it British or Brittonic?

Catch my drift?</text>
