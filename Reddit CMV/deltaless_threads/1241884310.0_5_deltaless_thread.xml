    <title>CMV: if you live in a “traditionally Christian” nation you should use Merry Christmas as the default greeting/goodbye unless you’re asked not to.</title>

    <original_post>Basically I think of it similar to misgendering people. In that context use the pronouns of the gender they appear to present as (unless you already know the person’s wishes). If and when someone asks you to use an alternate set, you apologise and change going forward. 

The same should be done with Christmas- in my experience almost nobody has any genuine objection to being told merry Christmas, hell, I was discussing just today with a woman in a full hijab our favourite (largely secular) aspects of Christmas, all the while referring to things as “Christmas XYZ”. However if someone tells me they’d prefer happy holidays then I’ll just switch. Just like pronouns it literally makes no difference to me. 

You can change my view by showing me that knowingly using words that will make someone else feel less welcome or upset is not worth it compared to the potential loss I might feel at using a different term. Of course maybe you can come up with other arguments I’ve not thought of.

Edit: this only applies “at this time of year” say more or less the month of December.</original_post>

    <text>Humans inevitably see the world through their own extremely limited and individually based biased point of view, so we should all say whatever we want to say for the holidays. 

We should project who we truly are, but nothing in this world comes without a price, so the caveat is that by doing so and accepting this practice, everyone must then be tolerant of other people’s beliefs and view points.

    <text>That’s not disagreeing with me though. My point is that I think that if someone asks you to use a different phrase with them specifically, you should, not because you’re obliged to, morally or legally, but because it’s a nice thing to do and it costs basically nothing.</text>

    <text>Perhaps. Perhaps by obliging that person you offer them nothing. Perhaps it would be better to stand your ground in attempt to sway that person. To teach them something. To allow someone to live within their veil of self validation, to allow someone to think that they are are always right, does that really “help” them?</text>

    <text>Delta!

That’s a fair point but I guess speaks more broadly to the issue of free speech. Having said that we frequently make concessions to politeness, sacrificing some free speech in the process, for instance it’s generally considered impolite to swear like a sailor to a stranger, even if you mean no ill will. If i was asked to swear less by a stranger I’d likely capitulate rather than try and lecture them on free speech.</text>

    <text>I agree. But only if it doesn’t come at a cost to you. 

I was taught that you “shouldn’t swear” growing up. I understand that this was taught to me so that I would be polite and behave; discipline. However, swearing is extremely important. It creates emphasis. It’s like any other literary tool. If overused, it defeats itself. Think of it like an exclamation point. 

If a stranger has asked me how I am.. and I personally draw a difference between a day being plain old “terrible” day, and a day being “fucking terrible”...and I omit the expletive in an effort to appease them and the principles of being polite... well now I have just lied to them and myself in an effort to uphold a social more. The conversation could proceed entirely differently now. I would have altered it through my dishonesty. 

I sacrificed honesty in order to try and uphold social “norms.” I lied to be polite. I again ask the same question... have I helped that person?

If it truly comes at no deficit to the person obliging, then I agree, it’s harmless. However, we play how we practice. Practice doesn’t make perfect, practice makes permanent. Do this countlessly throughout seemingly daily and meaningless interactions with strangers, and you may then find yourself doing this with the people you care about the most and truly want to be honest with, purely out of habit.

    <text>Just FYI, for your delta to count, the ! goes before the word delta.

Like this:

!\_delta

but with no underscore, and no space between ! and the word delta.</text>
