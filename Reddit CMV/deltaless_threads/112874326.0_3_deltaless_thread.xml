    <title>There is no such thing as a "waste of time" - CMV</title>
    <original_poster>MorganaLeFaye</original_poster>
    <original_post>I hear (and read) it all the time. 

"Video games are a waste of time." 

"Watching TV is a waste of time." 

"Reddit is a waste of time."

"Watching paint dry is a waste of time." 

OK, so I don't hear that last one too frequently, but it still applies. What qualifies one person to decide how other people should spend their time, or what activities are worth engaging in while others are not? 

It is totally possible to waste the time you have available (i.e. procrastination), **which is not what I am talking about.** However, in terms of leisure activities and personal time, I don't think there is such a thing as a "waste of time." 

**EDIT** - I should clarify that when I say "there is no such thing as a waste of time" what I mean to say is that no one can tell another person what a waste of time is, or that a general activity cannot be broadly condemned as a waste of time. 

Change my view.

Well, I agree with the second part (that a general activity cannot be broadly condemned as a waste of time), but disagree about the first. There are many scenarios in which I can imagine someone could feasibly tell someone else they are wasting their time. If I spent 2 hours writing a bibliography for my essay, and my tutor informs me that the bibliography is not necessary - he would be correct in pointing out that I have been wasting my time.</text>

    <text>But you learned something while writing that bibliography, about the sources you were citing, etc. If nothing else, you reaffirmed your knowledge of how to write a bibliography. That is not wasted time (maybe wasted effort, but not wasted time). </text>

By your logic, actual waste (as in: literal rubbish) isn't 'waste', because even discarded trash can be used for *something*.</text>

    <text>If you turn apple cores into a compost heap, it isn't waste. Something isn't "waste" if it is *used* for something. 

That use can be relaxation, amusement or anything else. If someone *wants* to spend their time staring up at their ceiling, they are getting *something* out of it so are *using* their time. 

Now, an individual may later regret spending time staring at the ceiling, but others doing the same thing may see that as valuable reflection or relaxation time. That's why no one else can come around and say "staring at the ceiling is a waste of time" because that's not for them to decide. </text>

    <text>What have you learned while gaming, what have you got to show for it after 100s of hours spent grinding levels.</text>

    <text>There is a lot you can learn from video games including analytical skills and hand/eye coordination. But let's pretend for a moment that's not true... You don't have to learn anything for time to be considered "well spent" or even just "not wasted." 

People play video games because they enjoy them. Why would time spent enjoying the moment be considered wasteful?

    <text>You can only learn so much before the skills stop improving.  Someone who plays videogames for hours a day isn't going to have continuously ascending analytical skills and flawless hand/eye coordination, they'll just be slightly better than someone who doesn't play videogames (and that's assuming that the non-video game players don't do other activities that improve these skills more effectively).  Even then, the differences are negligible and are only really seen in scientific tests.

As far as your second point, I agree.  If you're doing it for enjoyment, there's nothing wrong with that.  Everyone should put some time away to do things they enjoy, and I don't consider that wasteful.</text>

    <text>Can't pure entertainment be a goal in of itself?  I don't consider anything enjoyable a waste of time.  I don't believe you have to learn anything or improve your mental faculties for something to be worth it.  Emotional well being and maintenance is never a waste of time.</text>
