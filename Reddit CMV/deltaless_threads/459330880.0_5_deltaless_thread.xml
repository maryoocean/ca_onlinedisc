    <title>CMV:The death of the CD/Album as the primary means of listening to music and music ownership is bad</title>

    <original_post>Growing up, I saw music delivery move from vinyl to cassette to CD, and now to streaming. My friends and I used to spend hours each month at the record store, browsing through new albums and searching for classics or hidden gems. We'd take them home, put them on and listen while reading the liner notes and digging on the cover art. In many ways, the cover art could be just as cool and compelling as a great record. 

Now, streaming has replaced record sales as everyone either downloads songs from itunes or creates their own playlist from spotify, pandora, or some other service. In the end, you don't actually "own" this music, you're essentially leasing it through whatever service you choose. You lose the tactile enjoyment of pulling vinyl from it's sleeve or opening a jewel case. You the lose the discovery of finding more than one great tune on a record. For example, Fleetwood Mac's Rumours had only four singles, so in today's age how would any discover the great tunes on that record like Second Hand News, Never Going Back Again, The Chain, or Gold Dust Woman?

While you can find all sorts of undiscovered music through streaming, you don't necessarily own it. IT might be a good companion because of its ease of use, but owning physical copies of the music you love is still superior to having a copy on your phone.

CMV, that streaming music is inferior to owning either vinyl or cd's of musical artists work.

    <text>Why is owning a physical copy any better than having it downloaded to a phone or playlist? The tactile feeling might be a little fun, but that's about it.

Digital media makes it much easier to listen to a song when and where you want. No more digging through CD cases for that one song you have to find among many others you don't care about. And CDs are not a permanent thing. If they're scratched and lost that's it. And it's so much easier to find many more songs that you enjoy in a digital format.</text>
