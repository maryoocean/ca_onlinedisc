    <title>CMV: Kill La Kill's second half ruins the show (spoilers)</title>

    <original_post>The high school setting was perfect. It helped keep things grounded (as much as you could), and really tied into the themes of control vs freedom. Satsuki and her student council showed some of the appeal of tight governmental control (fairness, awarding exceptionalism, etc) without ever fully condoning it, but you \*understand\* why people would follow her. Plus, you have the moments where you question if Ryuko is actually making things better, or risks just turning into another Satsuki, which tends to happen very often whenever a revolution happens.

But then you leave the school setting, and then they throw in aliens, and world domination, and the stupid twists and Satsuki's mom who is just the most evil parent in anime, seemingly for no reason. Like, come on! It was so good! Why did they throw it all away?!</original_post>

    <text>This was why i stopped watching lol i liked the idea that the clothes were aliens i didnt like how the bad guys became the good guys lol thats like textbook cliche. Though i guess at some point every show has to expand the universe or become stale so i suppose that was the goal</text>
