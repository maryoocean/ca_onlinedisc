    <title>CMV: Adding rape as a legal punishment would be good for society.</title>
    <original_poster>kimagical</original_poster>
    <original_post>This started off as a showerthought but I couldn't find any reason this isn't legit, so here we go.

We need to add rape to the legal system as a viable additional punishment for heinous crimes.

I know what you're thinking. But it's not an unsually cruel punishment.

We already have the death sentence, and if not that, then life sentences of solitary confinement, which virtually all experts-- including official statements from the United Nations-- agree is torture.

And if you're a prisoner today, sometimes you are *already* getting raped. Other times you go "gay for the stay".

So don't tell me adding rape as a legal punishment is anything unusually cruel or sinking lower morally.

If anything, this would help guards regulate "safer" condom-provided prison rape, like how weed became regulated and safer after it was legalized in Canada.

So it's not much of a negative. But why is it a positive?

Here's why: there's a rapidly rising population of involuntary celibates. In the last 10 years alone, the population of these "incels" doubled from 12% of the young male population to 24%.

This is 45,000 incels ballooning to over 100,000. These incels have been behind an alarming number of mass murder sprees.

Every day incels on the dark web discuss organizing terrorism.

There's no fancy peer-reviewed study on that last bit yet-- but I've seen this happening with my own eyes by digging around social media years ago.

I found massive and highly active online communities who worship Elliot Roger and egg each other on to muster up the courage to flatten people with trucks. Buy automatic weapons and kill.

If the population is given free license on their own time to rape any inmates who have been handed the punishment of rape, this could solve some of the incel problem.

It *may* not help; obviously there's no proof in this area. It would be a moral wild west, but there's no time to wait. Innocent people are being shot to death.

It would be far more immoral to not at least try this preventative measure when there are innocents being murdered.

This availability of prison sex slaves with no bodily rights would also directly compete with street prostitution, lowering the demand for a dangerous and morally questionable industry, at best saving two birds with one nest.

At worst, we realize it's not helping and we revert the program. My view is that there is enough reason to try it.</original_post>

Not to be a dick, but just because you say something doesn't make it true. Rape is cruel. Rape is inhumane. Rape destroys people psychologically, leaves mental and physical trauma. It's something done by cruel and disturbed people.

&amp;gt;We already have the death sentence, and if not that, then life sentences of solitary confinement, which virtually all experts-- including official statements from the United Nations-- agree is torture.

HOW is this an argument for rape as punishment? "We already torture people, let's make it worse"? 

&amp;gt;And if you're a prisoner today, sometimes you are already getting raped. Other times you go "gay for the stay".

Yes, I will, in fact, tell you that. The existence of rape in prisons does not mean it is morally justified or even morally gray to make this a state-sanctioned punishment for crime.

&amp;gt;If the population is given free license on their own time to rape any inmates who have been handed the punishment of rape, this could solve some of the incel problem.

Wow, because what a population of people who do not see humanity in women and regard them as objects worthy of rape and violence need is... free license to rape people? This statement is just mind-boggling to me.

&amp;gt;This availability of prison sex slaves with no bodily rights would also directly compete with street prostitution, lowering the demand for a dangerous and morally questionable industry, at best saving two birds with one nest.

No, it would not. I can sure as shit tell you there are people who have sex with sex workers that would be deeply uncomfortable raping a felon in prison. Not all sex work is rape, not all people who engage with sex workers are devious abusers looking to blow a load anywhere they can.

You hardly at all provide any real argument as to why it isn't morally abhorrent - you just claim "we do bad things to felons already" as though that's a good reason to do worse.

Whenever we make things worse for prisoners, we make things worse for innocent people convicted of crimes, too. If you're not capable of seeing any humanity in criminals, fine - but spend some time thinking long and hard about what it would be like to be falsely accused of a crime, convicted, and then subjected to court-mandated rape as punishment, and ask yourself if that's a society you want to live in.</text>
