    <title>CMV: if you treat guns like toys, or mock gun safety, you aren’t responsible enough to own guns.</title>
    <original_poster>snbrd512</original_poster>
    <original_post>First off, if you want to own guns, that’s your business. However, I see WAY too many people on social media doing irresponsible things with them. Waving them around in stupid videos, posting pictures of them “dressed up”, and posts mocking basic gun safety like locking your shit up. This level of reckless irresponsibility not only makes you look like an idiot, but is fodder for liberals who are scared of guns (that said, I am 100% in support of better background checks and mental health screenings for gun owners, especially those who hoard guns). Anyone who has ever been in the military, or even taken a gun safety class, should know that guns aren’t toys, and you treat your weapons with respect, yet many people don’t seem to understand this. 

I guess what I’m asking is for someone to defend the viewpoint that their guns are their right and they can use them how they like. 


Edit: so far I haven’t seen an argument that isn’t “SECOND AMENDMENT!!!!!”  which doesn’t at all address the responsibility aspect of my post. I get the law says one thing. I’m not arguing the law. I’m talking about whether or not someone is responsible enough to own guns. Maybe I didn’t articulate that well enough. </original_post>

    <text>Being able to protect yourself from another individual trying to inflict violence upon you seems like something that should be considered a basic human right, regardless of which tools are used to defend oneself. 

Implying that some specific group should not be allowed to share that same basic human right would be wrong on many levels, and it also paved the way for someone else to come along and say “yeah, and *those people* don’t deserve *these* human rights either!” until eventually it becomes very prejudicial, bigoted, and downright unfair. 

It sets the precedent that it’s acceptable to infringe upon the human rights as well as the civil rights of certain groups that you disagree with, dislike, or are uncomfortable with them having the same rights as others. </text>
