    <title>CMV: The Canadian trucker "protesters" are terrorists, and should be charged as such.</title>

    <original_post>The right to protest doesn't allow you to disrupt society. Terrorism is defined as violence or intimidation for political reason, I'd hope you agree that honking horns for hours in a city, displaying nazi flags, and destroying the economy all fit that definition. Protesters are not, or should not, be able to disrupt trade or impede traffic, and arguing otherwise is insane. These fucks are no better than the GQP who attacked the capitol, and they need to be removed from society. If not, they set the precedant you can destroy society if you call it a protest, which obviously can't be allowed to happen. My view will be changed if you can convince me that they aren't terrorists, or that their actions are in any way justifible.</original_post>

    <text>Do you consider BLM to be terrorists?

They regularly shut down major portions of the city with their protests. They were hugely disruptive to everyone. 

They 'Disrupted Trade' and 'Impeded Traffic' which seem to be important criteria to you. 

I am genuinely curious if your hatred covers both sides of the political spectrum here.</text>
