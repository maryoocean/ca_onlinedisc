    <title>CMV: Jesus is not that unique of a figure</title>
    <original_poster>CantPenTheSnowden</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've always wondered why people are so obsessed with this Jesus character.

His messages are not unique, in fact they are rather common knowledge, except for the few clever sayings that are attributed to him. Feed the poor, don't let your heart be consumed with wealth and material goods, believe in a higher power, do unto others what you want others to do to you etc. are all common sayings that were preached by hundreds of sages before and after the life and death of Jesus. 

I think of Jesus as being another charismatic figure whose death or martyrdom was made into a legend by his followers in order to legitimize Christendom. I mean what other fashion can you justify genocide, bigotry and forced conversion other than proclaiming that your message is about peace and love? This sort of doublethink astounds me.

    <text>Their is no proof that Jesus even existed other than the Bible, which for all we know could have been a fictional story even when it was written. Jesus was born in the Roman Empire, yet he has no birth certificate. Jesus lived in the Roman Empire, yet their are no census records of him. Jesus was criminally prosecuted in the Roman Empire, yet no court records have ever been found. He also died via execution in the Roman Empire, yet no Death Certificate exists.</text>

    <text>Jesus the man, the historical figure, Jesus of Nazareth existed and that fact is undisputed by virtually the entire historical community. Jesus was not a Roman citizen and would not have had either a birth or death certificate provided, no court records exist because Pilate acted unilaterally. Jesus was never put to a formal Roman trial, the Sanhedrin interrogated him and then brought him before Pilate to be tried. Pilate, after questioning, sent him to Herod Antipas since Jesus technically fell into his rule. Herod questioned him, and finding him to be no threat sent him back to Pilate where he was finally condemned. At no point is he ever subject to a trial, he is questioned and interrogated, but he's never formally put on trial so why would there be a formal court record of a non existent trial. Your final point again misses that Jesus, not being a Roman citizen, had no part in any Roman census because the during the reign of Augustus the censuses only accounted for Roman citizens. Your first point that the only proof is the bible is also mistaken as both Josephus and Tacitus make mentions of him (Josephus does so twice)
