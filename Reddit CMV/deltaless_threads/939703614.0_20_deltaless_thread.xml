    <title>CMV: Where your born doesn't matter and country pride is pointless</title>
    <original_poster>Blank-VII</original_poster>
    <original_post>I don't think I belong to a country and I think the concept is odd. I was born in the UK and have lived here all my life, but I fail to understand why people are so hard-core about being a 'proud brit' or anything. Where I was born isn't something I was able to decide for myself, and I want my life to be what I make out of it, not what it decides for me. I believe the only way to belong to a country is to find one whose culture is similar to your own tastes and opinions, and to move there. What's the point in being proud of a country I was born in if I feel no attachment to how it's run or anything else?

*you're

*View partially changed. Country pride is not pointless.

**Main view unchanged, it seems no-one can quite convince me. I've had some fantastic conversations and I'm really happy with how many of you engaged without being toxic. Stay safe y'all. Thanks so much!**</original_post>

    <text>First, where you're born does matter. 

Let's say in Country A, everyone over the age of five has their left hand amputated, no if's and's or but's. Clearly where you were born would matter.

Or  let's say in Country B, their's a major strong cultural movement to teach all the citizens of that country to hate the Jews. You'd be more likely to hate the Jews too.

And, let's say there's a country C, which is one of the world's oldest democracies, in country C, freedom of speech and expression and of  the individual have been valued for a long time. Well, I'd expect someone born in country C  to act a lot like you, all things being equal.

I'm an American, and the fact that I was born here was a happy accident. But I'm so proud that I live in a Republic. The people who've been building this country I arrived in at birth have been doing a great, great job, and it makes me feel like, if I can help, even just a little, I can leave this place a little better than when I came into it.

In my country, if I want, I can tell President Trump to gag on my big fat dick. In China if I said that  to their dictator, I'd be 'disappeared.' 

And the reason I'd be disappeared in China but not in the UK, is that the Chinese decided they wanted a society where people disappear, and the British long ago, decided they didn't. 

So, maybe pride is going too far. But it seems reasonable to have some complex relationship with your  country of birth. Like, I didn't choose my parents, but in general I love them.</text>
