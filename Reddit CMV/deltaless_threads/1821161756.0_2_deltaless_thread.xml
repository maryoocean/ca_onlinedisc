    <title>CMV: It’s extremely stupid to ask celebrities to condemn their fans when they make threats to another celebrity (or other people, in general).</title>
    <original_poster>theguyoverthere50</original_poster>
    <original_post>Recently, I looked up Perez Hilton because I had no idea who he was and I kept hearing his name, and I was annoyed right off the bat. Looks like he tried to fling mud on Ariana Grande (alleging that she took coke at a party) which lead to nasty comments and threats by fans of her towards Hilton. After a while, she complied with his request and told her fans to chill out.

It drives me nuts that this sort of shit happens as though people that like a certain celebrity are dogs that can be called off of their attack when the center of their infatuation says they want it to end.

It insulates evasive pussy conduct like that of Hilton, and makes celebrities look like the bad guys if they refuse to call the fans off, making it look like the celebrity sicced the fans on them in the first place.

We’re left in this surreal area where celebrity targets are making efforts to protect their shit-talkers, which they should have no obligation to do. Grande sings songs, it’s not like she’s a mob boss.

But this is just a case study, there are probably thousands of examples similar to this.</original_post>

    <text>I think generally speaking online the best way to win an argument is to have the other person say something that the public determine as wrong, or more wrong than anything that you've done.

For example.

Person A: I played music till 3 O'Clock in the Morning, I destroyed your fence, I called your significant other a hoar, but you **called the police and they could have murdered me.** 

Person B: Yes, I called the police on you, after you commit several minor crimes.

*Twitter: Person B tired to Murder Person A*

I think that extending the argument to person fans makes it even easier.

Person A: I played music till 3 O'Clock in the Morning, I destroyed your fence, I called your significant other a hoar, but **your fans said they'd murder me.** 

*Twitter: Person A is being Murdered by person B fans.*

If Person A has to prove this in court, or even in an Interview then it would be extremely different, but I think in online spaces accusing a person fans of doing X is the best way to win an argument on Twitter.</text>
