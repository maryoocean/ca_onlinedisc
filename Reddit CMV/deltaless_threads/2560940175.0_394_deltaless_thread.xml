    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>American is the agreed upon way to call people from the USA, and it's senseless to blame any Americans for referring themselves in this way. Theres no other obvious name to derive from United States of America.

But it's very annoying how we are then stuck with no easy way to refer to the whole landmass of America and its peoples, and it would be very useful to have a name for it given the shared history of native Americans, European settlement and colonization.

Also Americans could've just invented a name for themselves. People from Costa Rica call themselves "Ticos", and with how much influence the US has on the world the name would easily spread.</text>
