    <title>I believe that it is in the strategic best interests of the US to militarily intervene in Ukraine. CMV</title>
    <original_poster>TEmpTom</original_poster>
    <original_post>1) The Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances. Negotiated by Ukraine, the US, the UK, and Russia in accordance to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Ukraine should give up its nuclear arms in exchange for "protection." These "protections" specify to

&amp;gt;Seek United Nations Security Council action if nuclear weapons are used against Ukraine.

&amp;gt; and 

&amp;gt;Consult with one another if questions arise regarding these commitments.

Though, the treaty does not specify any defensive pact between these powers and Ukraine if the country is invaded or threatened militarily, I still believe that it would be in the best interests of the US to treat the Budapest Memorandum as one. Due to the nature of the agreement, with vague assurances of protection in exchange for complete nuclear proliferation of the country, it would set a terrible precedent for future nuclear proliferation negotiations with countries who have just developed their nuclear arms if Ukraine is so easily attacked with close to no assistance from other powers whatsoever. Though, the Budapest Memorandum does not guarantee protection from nuclear powers, it will be interpreted as such by politicians in countries seeking nuclear weapons. Negotiations would be increasingly  difficult if they cannot guarantee protection from larger powers if they were to be attacked like Ukraine. 

2) It sets another terrible precedent of justifying foreign invasion based on a protection of ethnic [insert people of invading country here], and also a precedent of invasions and annexations without consequence. Without western response, more countries may consider it justified to invade or annex parts of weaker destabilized countries using this very excuse. A US/NATO military response may ensure that other countries seeking to invade and annex their neighboring countries could not do so without a consequence of US/NATO retaliation. Though, they may seek some other equally trumped up justification, the mere show of force in Ukraine in response to an invading force may as well deter many similar situations in the future.

3) It will weaken Russia internationally, and possibly gain the US new allies and new NATO members. A military defeat of the Russian military by US/NATO forces will definitely weaken Russia's influence regionally, and globally. Syria would possibly lose most of their support from their biggest ally, and the Russian international prestige and economy would undoubtedly be extremely weakened by their reputation in the war. Ex-Soviet states both in Eastern Europe, and Central Asia may see the threat of the Russian invasion of Ukraine to be possibly threatening to their sovereignty in the future, as well as the US' integrity in defending their allies, and other invaded nations as an assurance to their security if they joined NATO. Ukraine is definitely going to join NATO, and nobody wants to be the second Ukraine in this situation, so many of them may immediately apply for membership.

4) Diplomacy has failed, and I do not believe that the Russians will back away from the Crimea and respect Ukraine's sovereignty within its current borders with anything short of military force. I believe that sanctions would be completely ineffective to solve the current issue at hand. Even if they did hurt Russia's economy in the long run, Crimea would be long a part of Russia, and no amount of economic downturn would ever make the Russians give up that territory. 

**Why I believe US military intervention would be relatively non-disastrous.**

1) People keep saying "Russia's a nuclear power. Its going to be WW3. Nuclear holocaust" etc. I do not believe that anyone is stupid enough to escalate a regional conflict into a full scale nuclear war even if the US decides to intervene. No one is going to throw nukes at each other, not tactically or otherwise, the concept of MAD still exists. The only possibility of Russia using a nuke is 1) NATO forces have capture Moscow, and Russia is on the brink of total defeat, or 2) In retaliation to an enemy nuclear strike. Neither of these situations are going to happen in a regional conventional war between the US and Russia.

2) People say "This is going to be another Iraq/Afghan war. We don't want to spend another 3 trillion dollars on another war." Although, an intervention would cost some money, it won't be nearly as expensive as the Iraq and Afghan wars. With clear objectives to defend a country against a foreign invader, and not to invade a country to topple their government, a US military intervention would look similar to the Gulf War on a larger scale. 

3) "Europe depends on Russian oil, so the Russians have the EU by the balls." Currently, Russian oil makes up about 32.6% of total oil imports in the EU, and undoubtedly the EU will suffer from slight oil shortages in the short term. However, the US, Canada, and Saudi Arabia could use this opportunity to establish themselves as primary providers of oil to Europe. In the long term, the massive European oil market would benefit theses countries greatly, and the EU has just made itself energy independent from a major geo-political enemy. Slight price controlled exports of oil to Europe may be needed to alleviate shortages in the short run, but ultimately all of these countries would benefit from having Europe energy independent from Russia.

    <text>&amp;gt;4) Diplomacy has failed

Diplomacy has just started (sanctions).  It's a bit early to say that they have already failed.

&amp;gt;and I do not believe that the Russians will back away from the Crimea and respect Ukraine's sovereignty within its current borders with anything short of military force. I believe that sanctions would be completely ineffective to solve the current issue at hand.

In order to discuss opinions, I need to know where you are getting them from (ie whats your source).  If it is an unfounded belief, then introduction of data/sources to dispute it wouldn't necessarily change your opinion.

&amp;gt;Even if they did hurt Russia's economy in the long run, Crimea would be long a part of Russia, and no amount of economic downturn would ever make the Russians give up that territory.

I don't know all of the implications of Crimea, and I'm pretty sure the majority of people here don't have all the facts:

Things that I know about:
- Crimea is dependent on Ukraine for most basic supplies and the only land route to crimea is through the Ukraine
- Russia wants it for the port access to the Black sea
- Tons of troops are already stationed there holding Ukraine's forces hostage

What I'm getting at is that some people aren't really paying attention to #1 and how difficult it might be to keep Crimea from becoming a desolate wasteland if Ukraine says no more land transport to the peninsula.  Without comprehensive knowledge, it becomes difficult for us to appropriately judge what is likely to happen.

With regards to the remainder of the post, a lot of that is why we should do something about the crimea situation, which I don't think anyone will dispute.  With regards to the effect of US  military involvement and "diminishing Russia", understand that there will also be costs for the US, both in terms of $$$ and international relations as well.</text>

    <text>Well currently all sanctions proposed are being completely scoffed off at by the Russian government. I agree with you that it is very early on in diplomacy, and the facts might not all be there, but I highly doubt that the Russians would concede the territory because of western sanctions. This is mostly speculation based on their current reactions, but there are 2 things I'm absolutely certain about.

1) Russia already recognizes Crimea as a separate entity from Ukraine, and has recently approved its annexation. 

2) The longer Crimea is a part of Russia, the less relevancy this situation is going to be in international politics, the more legitimacy that Crimea is now a part of Russia, and the less likely that the Russians will give the territory up.

I recognize the damages to Crimea, and I understand that there would be costs to a US intervention, but I believe that they will mostly benefits will outweigh the costs in the long run. Mostly benefits to US global influence.

    <text>&amp;gt;1) Russia already recognizes Crimea as a separate entity from Ukraine, and has recently approved its annexation.

There is a whole lot of controversy/many threads on the legitimacy of the vote in Crimea.  If Russia supports it but the rest of the world doesn't, I'm not sure how it'll turn out, possibly like Taiwan/China with the 2 china policy, but who really knows.

&amp;gt;2) The longer Crimea is a part of Russia, the less relevancy this situation is going to be in international politics, the more legitimacy that Crimea is now a part of Russia, and the less likely that the Russians will give the territory up.

There is definite legitimacy to this idea, as often possession is 9/10ths of the law.

&amp;gt;I recognize the damages to Crimea, and I understand that there would be costs to a US intervention, but I believe that they will mostly benefits will outweigh the costs in the long run. Mostly benefits to US global influence.

As far as I know, if we engage as part of a multinational task force to do this, yeah, it definitely could be good and bring kudos to the US.  That said, if we go it alone like Iraq and Afghanistan, while we are still cleaning up (although to lesser degrees) we would definitely be putting a strain on the US army which has already been conscripted to reduce costs due to the US economy/lack of a recovery.  You would definitely have a better argument if the US were not engaged in any wars/major war cleanup activities, the US had a stable economy to foot the bill, we had the backing of the rest of the world.  

To give a metaphor, the US going it alone would be much like us sticking our necks out.  It puts a lot of risk on us without necessarily that much definite benefit.  Yes you can talk about potential other outcomes/benefits, but then you must acknowledge other potential poor outcomes, threats and unknowables (the unknown unknowns if you will.)

    <text>I highly doubt that the rest of NATO and the EU would just sit there patiently while the US mops up the Russians on their front door. If anything, its usually the rest of the NATO countries who follow the lead of the US if it decides to take the initiative, similar to the Syrian situation about half a year ago. 

I believe that rebuilding Ukraine would not cost the US nearly as much as they spent in Iraq and Afghanistan. Firstly, this would be a defensive war against a foreign invader. Secondly, local popular opinion of US assistance in Ukraine would most likely be overwhelmingly positive unlike in Iraq and Afghanistan. Thirdly, the EU could definitely foot a good part of the bill. Like I said in my original post, I think this would look very similar to the Gulf War. 

You raise some good points, but I think it ultimately boils down to a cost and benefit analysis.</text>

At this point the Russian forces are firmly entrenched in Crimea.  We would have to conquer first and then reinstate Ukranian control over Crimea

Although the election is most likely inaccurate, there are a significant # of ethnic Russians in the Crimean peninsula.  With regards to local opinion, the US stepping in militarily without first exhausting non-military options would immediately be denounced as empire building.  I agree with you its a bunch of BS and the US isn't trying to establish a colony or whatnot there, but thats how it would be viewed.

&amp;gt;the EU could definitely foot a good part of the bill

The EU will pay for their own troops.  I highly doubt they would reimburse us for our military expenses.

&amp;gt; I think it ultimately boils down to a cost and benefit analysis

I agree, but I think it is naive to say that everyone would love us if we step in with a big military hammer.  More than likely missteps will be made (it always happens despite the best intentions and well laid plans).  That will cost us dearly.  Think about contractors when building a building.  They always underestimate the costs and more often than not get into a situation where costs overrun estimates.  That will more than likely happen here.</text>

Maybe. Or we could just cut off any supply line connecting Russia to the Crimea in the hopes of forcing the troops stationed in Crimea to surrender. Either way, it would involve a deployment capable of defending mainland Ukraine from a Russian invasion, and blockading the Crimea. Something I believe the US/NATO is more than capable of.

An intervention would be immediately denounced as imperialism, but anyone who denounces the US for imperialism because of their intervention would also technically have to accept that Crimea is a part of Russia, which is an even more blatant form of imperialism. At that point, those nations would have lost all their credibility in this conflict. I believe that the diplomatic backlash to the US would be minimal, or at least A LOT less than its campaigns in the middle east. 

&amp;gt;The EU will pay for their own troops. I highly doubt they would reimburse us for our military expenses.

I was thinking more of investing to rebuild Ukraine/Crimea's infrastructure after the war is over.

You're right that missteps are likely to be made, and any campaign in Ukraine would have to be extremely calculated and executed with caution, but from an objective point of view, an intervention in Ukraine is ultimately a war for the defensive of a nation's sovereignty. Of course you could argue it both ways, but unlike its previous wars, a US military intervention in Ukraine would have much fewer "grey-areas" than say invading Afghanistan because they're harboring terrorists, or invading Iraq for having WMDs. I mentioned the Gulf War a lot, but I really think that an intervention in Ukraine would be very similar in both justification and result as the Gulf War. </text>

This is what will happen by default, and doesn't require US military intervention, just a maintenance of the status quo, unless you mean US military intervention as sitting in Ukraine and keeping a blockage without invading Crimea, which is different than what most people would understand military intervention to be.

This is tricky, as what we perceive might be a minor hypocritical issue, others may take as a huge problem, if they initially have an anti-US sentiment, which seems to be the more vocal population in the world at large.

Again, it seems that your "military intevention" means don't actually fight russia, but starve out the occupation of Crimea.  Is this accurate or what do you mean by military intervention?

Military intervention doesn't have to involve direct combat. Blockading all supply lines from Russia to the Crimea will require US assistance, and there is a high possibility that the Russians will attack the rest of Ukraine if we tried to cut them off, that's when most of the NATO forces are needed.

Well for one, the US wouldn't be toppling any recognized established government, and replacing them with a new regime from scratch. Think of it as returning things to the way it was about a month before today. 

&amp;gt;Again, it seems that your "military intevention" means don't actually fight russia, but starve out the occupation of Crimea. Is this accurate or what do you mean by military intervention?

Yes, military intervention doesn't necessarily require direct combat, although it should be deployed in case an actual war breaks out. The Russian annexation of the Crimea could be called a military intervention, yet there still hasn't been a war. </text>
