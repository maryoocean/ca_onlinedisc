    <title>CMV: The notion that the Democrats or Republicans "must" run Biden or Trump "because there are no other viable candidates" is ridiculous. There are thousands of people who would make better presidential candidates for 2024 than Biden or Trump.</title>

    <original_post>Every argument for Biden or Trump to run in 2024 boils down to some version of "status quo" or "inertia." We're told that the Ds and Rs have no choice but to run these super-old candidates because there's nobody else who could be suitable.

&amp;#x200B;

In a nation of 332,000,000 people, there are well over 100 million who are over the age of 35, American-born, and have resided in the United States for 14 years or more - in other words, are constitutionally eligible to run for president.

Out of those 100 million, surely at least half have a basic education, are mature, sensible, decent people, and have demonstrated solid character - and also be significantly younger than Trump or Biden.

Out of those 50 million, surely at least ten million would qualify as *highly* educated - the metrics of which can be tricky to figure out (is it a master's degree? or something else?) - but they would be significantly above average.

Out of those 10 million, surely at least one million would be quite exceptional - people who have substantially high IQ, have advanced quite far in life and a career - such as being a doctor, or having worked in public governmental service for decades, etc.

And out of those million, surely at least 10,000 would have the political know-how, the charisma, the political interest, maybe have spent significant time abroad in foreign countries or speak multiple languages, to be a suitable president.

In fact, even in Congress, state legislatures or governorships alone, there must be dozens of good, qualified, educated, experienced politicians who would be much younger than Trump or Biden, and who would make suitable presidential candidates. 

So, CMV on this one. I don't buy for one moment the notion that, in a nation of 332 million people, America somehow has no choice but to run Biden vs. Trump in 2024 because "we've got no one else who'd be a good candidate."  </original_post>

    <text>You’re addressing both candidates as if they are coming to this situation from the same place and are being put forward for the same reasons and they are not.

Biden is running because Biden wants to run.  Yeah, the DNC could try to shut him down and make him step away, but there are huge problems with the visuals on that.  I’m not talking about the Bernie problem (although there are elements of that), but just an overall organizational look that will be very hard to shake heading into a general election.  It’s one thing to be perceived as putting your thumb on the scale during primaries to favor a candidate, but it’s another for there to be a schism in the party between the President and those who want him to go.  If you think the “Democrats in disarray” stories are bad now, imagine how it would be after a contentious internal fight.  Imagine if Biden won it anyway.  Barring *very* exceptional circumstances the Party is stuck behind the incumbent if the incumbent wants to run again.  Simple as that.  Sure, that whole boat *can* be overturned, but there’s no one waiting in the wings worth doing that for and doing it because “the younger voters aren’t happy” isn’t worth the instability it will cause.  Not to mention the end result is a question mark.

That’s a vastly different position than what the Republicans find themselves in because of Trump. He got elected on cult of personality and that cult is with him pretty much “ride or die” at this point.  So he has 30%, give or take, of the reliable Republican electorate locked down.  With how crowded the primary field has been, and still is, for the Republicans, that’s enough to get Trump through the primaries. Not only that, the Republicans are desperate to not alienate that segment of the voters because without them, the Republican Party can’t win a National election.  If the Republicans could coalesce around a non-Trump candidate early enough in the primary season then it’s possible that person could upset and take the nomination, but the risk there is that Trump isn’t exactly a good loser, so he’ll torch the place on his way out and probably still run independently which would kill whatever hope the upset candidate had of winning the election.

I can understand not being happy with the choices, but it isn’t that there are no “better” options. It’s that the simple process of US elections means that there are no other **viable** options.  That could change in the next few months, or it could continue to be true through the election.</text>
