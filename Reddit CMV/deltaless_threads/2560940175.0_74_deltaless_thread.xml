    <original_post>There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

I look forward to discussing with you all, thanks!</original_post>

    <text>Citizens of the USA are called "Americans."  That's the word. There isn't even another contender.  That it doesn't make sense is besides the point -- language is like that. We attach arbitrary sounds to concepts.  Sometimes you can make a chain of reason for why the sound is a bit less arbitrary -- in this case, the chain doesn't make good sense, but why are the Americas named for  Amerigo Vespucci, anyway?  The whole thing makes no sense.</text>
