    <title>CMV: Now that we have evolved past the need to eat meat, it is completely immoral to do so.</title>

    <original_post>Not a vegan or even a vegetarian, but I still hold this belief. I understand that we have evolved as carnivores, and that eating meat has always been essential to human survival. It holds nutrients you cant find anywhere else like B12, its heavily saturated which makes it an efficient food, and ot tastes damn good (which i would guess has something to do with evolution aswel).

These arguments are still valid in underdeveloped or poor countries, and under extreme conditions. However, in modern day western society's I can't seem to find one ethical argument for eating meat (not to mention the toll it takes on the environment). 

Is everyone just lazy like me, or is there more to it?</original_post>

    <text>Not really inmoral, its just life. Hunting, animal fights, a different conversation. 

Besides, most beliefs that a vegetarian diet can provide the same nutrients ad a regular diet are unbased or even debunked</text>
