    <title>cmv: Canada should install dirty atomic bombs in each big lake as an invasion deterrent.</title>
    <original_poster>maxi1134</original_poster>
    <original_post>With the upcoming climate changes and the fact that Canada has 20% of the freshwater reserve in the world. Russia, America, and other states might have an interest in invading Canada to access the water reserves and the Canadian north that will taw out and become available for crops.    
  

With this information, I believe that rigging the water table to be radioactive for eons in case of invasion would be the perfect deterrent to prevent the invasion from any other state.   

  

Especially America, as their water table would then also be contaminated</original_post>

    <text>First, Canada doesnâ€™t actually possess nuclear bombs and has ratified the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. It would be a breach of its obligations under international law to develop nuclear weapons.

Second, the US and Canada are close allies. They are members of a free-trade pact (USMCA, formerly NAFTA) and a mutual defence pact (NATO). Canada and the US also share a common language and close cultural ties (Canadian and US sports teams often compete in the same leagues, for example), and the two nations have fought in many wars together. The US would doubtless prefer to purchase water from Canada over invading the country. No other country is remotely in position to invade Canada - certainly not Russia, which cannot even handle the far weaker Ukraine.</text>
