    <title>CMV: Actively encouraging everyone to vote is overall harmful to a democratic society.</title>
    <original_poster>The_Law_of_Pizza</original_poster>
    <original_post>I would like to start off by clarifying that I do not support voter suppression, poll taxes, poll tests, or restrictions on voting rights in any form. I even disapprove of removing felons' rights to vote.

That said, I reject those things not because I believe broadening the voter pool benefits society, but because such restrictions are far too dangerous to allow people to meddle with. The temptation by those in power to restrict the rights of voters who disagree with them is too much for people to resist, so as a necessary evil we must prohibit such meddling in any way.

More to the point, though, I believe that actively encouraging *everyone* to vote is the other side of that same coin - it is rounding up reactionary, low information voters to vote for your position on an issue. It warps democracy from being about a collective process to discuss and decide policy, into a competition to see who can bus the most warm bodies to the polls.

Voting is a right, but it is also a responsibility. Voting without being informed is an abuse of that responsibility, and encouraging uninformed voters to go to the polls is aiding in that abuse for your own political benefit.

A democratic society functions best when the voters are rational and informed. They (ideally) learn what they can about any issue, make a subjective decision based on their internal values, and then vote for a candidate or proposal that they believe will best accomplish that. 

While obviously not always true, the people who make a point to go out and vote on their own tend to be the ones who actually care enough to put the time and effort into the process as described in my previous paragraph. They're the closest we get in reality, anyway.

Deliberately rounding up non-voters and pushing them towards the polls dredges up the opposite - low information, reactionary voters whose only knowledge on the issues likely comes from the partisan individuals who gave them the voter registration sheet. They seldom take the time to seek out the other side and hear their version of the story.

So, while these people have every right to vote, they're abusing that right and partisan organizations designed to "get out the vote" are complicit in that. They're harming the overall system for their own gain.

    <text>I think you're making an incorrect assumption that everybody that votes without being pushed must be a knowledgeable voter and those that must be pushed to vote are ignorant when it comes to politics. We all know this is not true.

For example, the elderly usually have the highest turn out rate when it comes to voting. It's not that elderly people are inherently engaged in politics but it's that they don't have anything else going on that would prevent them from voting on a Tuesday and all they care about are low taxes and keeping their social security. An elderly person might vote for a candidate without ever knowing their actual political stance as long as they say they'll lower taxes. So these elderly people weren't pushed to vote but yet they are gumming up the democratic system because they are not intelligent voters. (This is a generalization. I'm not saying all elderly voters do this, but it's a large portion).

Similarly, maybe a college student is being pushed to vote so they start doing research about the candidates and that turns them into an intelligent voter.

People have to be registered to vote. It's not like people are forcing young, dumb 18 year olds to register and vote all in the same day. I believe you must be registered to vote at least one month before big elections.

My point being, pushing someone to vote doesn't necessarily make less intelligent voters, it just makes more voters. And isn't that the point of a democratic system? A democratic system says that all voices are heard. You can't throw away an entire group of people that were encouraged to vote just because you have a misguided belief that they will be unintelligent at the polls.</text>
