    <title>CMV: If gender is a social construct, then so is race</title>
    <original_poster>BoppeBoye</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let us take, as a given, that gender is divorced from the circumstances of your birth, that it is not a mental illness, and that there is no biological basis for what gender identity someone should express. Have I phrased that effectively? I'm trying to be concise, but I want to portray that premise correctly.

Why, then, should race be different than gender? If race carries with it "shared experience" and "lived experience", etc - that assumes that the only way you could understand what it's like to be a minority is to have lived your entire life as that particular minority. I'm not arguing against that, I agree that there are certain experiences that I could not comprehend - for instance, overbearing &amp;amp; strict Asian parents with exceedingly high expectations. 

But, if someone can change their gender or decide (?) that they identify as a different gender without having the prior lived experience of said gender, then why can't someone identify as a different race?

I'm not able to encompass all the variables which could lead someone to identify as another gender, but is it not possible for someone to come to the same conclusion with their race? What if an Indian man grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood, saw or experienced the same (or similar) discrimination as them, had minimal exposure to Indian culture; and this led him to conclude that he identifies more closely as a black man, rather than Indian? 

I would also like to cite Rachel Dolezal, who was uniformly mocked for being (afaik) the first trans-black woman in the public eye. It seems similar to transgender discrimination to me, assuming that there is something wrong with her mentally for deciding to become a black woman... Anyway, I'm not really defending her because that's not really in line with what I described in the previous paragraph (she grew up privileged IIRC), but the public reaction of mockery goes against the leftist belief of acceptance, by my perspective.

So, in short, why can there be no such thing as trans-racial people, the same way there are transgender?

    <text>This question is tough to answer because the term "social construct" is often misunderstood and hard to pin down. The frustrating truth is that every "social construct" is unique and some may have a closer correlation with natural circumstance than others. I think this dilemma stems from a false equivalence between these two concepts that have critically essential nuances that differentiate them.

I've always thought of "gender" as a set of behavioral characteristics that, for the most part, correlate with natal sex. There *is* a biological basis for this association, and that is brain structure. We, humans, know that there are structural differences between male and female brains that, for the most part, correlate with natal sex. Sorry for the repetitive sentences, but my point is that your behavioral characteristics and your thoughts are all a result of something very physical, your brain. Gender Identity Disorder occurs when the structure of one's brain more resembles that of the opposite sex than natal sex: it is a medically recognized condition with a secure method of treatment; plenty of research is available via Google. Based on this, it seems reasonable to say that gender is the "sex of the brain," which is capable of being opposite from the genetic trait of sex, albeit a rare occurrence. By this definition, a "social construct" is not even necessary to explain the concept of gender and the occurrence of transgender people.

Many people are conflating actual transgenderism with different personality disorders and what I'll call "special snowflake-ism," which seems to be exclusive to people who grew up in the digital age. Many people tend to hyperfocus on the single trait of gender, resulting in people claiming to be Nth gender; they are mistakenly associating their unique personality traits with their gender.

It is also important to remember that gender dysphoria is not exclusive to transgenderism, which is why there are, and should be, many hoops for those claiming to be transgender to jump through before making any serious decisions. It's not as simple as saying, "I'm the other gender now!" There is an institutional "skepticism," so to speak, to keep it from being that simple.

The issue of "transracialism" is not comparable because there is no "race of the mind" to come into conflict with the genetic characteristic of race; or, at least, this has no scientific basis. The concept of a "race of the mind" seems to coincide more with the cultural experience of growing up as a part of a certain race. Of course, its silly to pretend you are a part of a culture that you are not, regardless of skin color. As far as I'm aware, and do correct me if I am wrong, it would be impossible to discern skin color from observing a brain scan, unless you were to make an assumption based on common mental conditions within a demographic, but that's ultimately beside the point.

It seems to me that "transracialism" is nothing more than another attempt by people with weak self-identities to find a new, exciting label for themselves. Unfortunately, this type of culture-hijacking and self-diagnosis behavior gets conflated with genuine transgenderism, which is a studied and well understood medical condition.

In short, nuance nuance nuance.

As an aside, why are we always hyper-focusing on arbitrary physical traits? Who cares? We are all humans, meant to be individual and real to ourselves, not our genetic traits. We should not be so obsessed with these characteristics that we forget to see the humanity in others *and* ourselves.</text>
