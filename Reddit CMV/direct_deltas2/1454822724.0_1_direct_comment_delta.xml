    <title>CMV: There is no compelling reason for me to come out as bisexual to my close friends and family</title>
    <original_poster>LexVeritas</original_poster>
    <original_post>Happy Pride month, all! This is something I've been thinking about for a while and I would love your input. 

I am a cisgender male who is bisexual (probably Kinsey 1-2, significant preference for women) and heteroromantic. While I occasionally enjoy sex with men, I have no interest in emotional or physical intimacy or romance with them--I don't even like kissing guys, basically I'm just into cock. I also enjoy sex with women, and have a strong urge towards intimacy and romance with female partners.

I've come out or mentioned my bisexuality to some acquaintances, mainly random internet strangers and sexual partners of both genders. However, I haven't brought it up with any of my close friends or family members, for the following reasons.

First: my sex life is my business. I haven't told any of my close friends or family members that I like feet either; it's irrelevant to those relationships. 

Second: I have no interest in dating men or i.e. making out with them at bars, and therefore don't feel that being closeted is at all restrictive or oppressive. I will never need to vent about the way a man I'm dating treats me, or about a man I'm crushing on, etc. like I sometimes do with women. 

Third: If I did come out, it would require explanation of all of the above. I really don't feel any need ever to say the words "Hi mom, I'm bisexual but heteroromantic, that means I sometimes like to suck cock but I'm not going to bring any boyfriends home to meet you." I certainly will have this conversation with my eventual spouse because they will be a core part of my sex life, but I don't feel that discussing my sexual preferences with family and friends would be at all liberating or fulfilling. 

EDIT because I forgot to include it: Fourth: The LGBTQ+ "scene" doesn't appeal to me at all. I will happily wear a rainbow shirt and go to a parade and I have many friends of all persuasions, but I'm not interested in putting a rainbow flag at my house or habitually hanging out at gay bars (though I'd have no problem going to one if a group of friends wanted to, and have done so before). Equal rights, preventing discrimination, AIDS research, and safe sex are all important issues to me, but not more so than i.e. climate change, criminal justice reform, or funding education. If I came out, there would be at least implicit pressure to participate in the LGBTQ+ community; I don't consider this a core part of my identity and so don't feel any desire to do so. 

While I'm fully aware that coming out or not is my own choice and prerogative, I am curious to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks all.</original_post>

Would you say you are *afraid* to bring it up to your family? You mention that it would be annoying (point 3) but I'm curious if you think they would be mad. You note that you don't feel oppressed, but what would your family do if they found out you had sex with men?

&amp;gt;I don't consider this a core part of my identity and so don't feel any desire to do so.

Honestly, that's all the more reason to do it. That is to say, if you are surrounded by people who mention their sexuality casually instead of dramatically, it seems reasonable to assume that you'd take sexuality less seriously or see it as less unusual. It's the same reason why cisgender allies list their pronouns: because if everyone lists their preferred pronouns, it's less cumbersome for trans people to do it. If you see your sexuality as a casual part of your identity, then saying so might help people see sexuality as a casual thing. It shows you don't need to be hyper-intense about your sexuality in order to be "not straight".

&amp;gt;If I did come out, it would require explanation of all of the above.

Why, exactly? Couldn't you just say "I'm bisexual"? Your argument is that people don't need to know things, but you seem adamant that if you told your family about being bisexual you would *have* to add the fact that you only like having sex with men and don't like kissing them or falling in love with them or anything like that. It basically sounds like you're afraid of what they'll think about you.</text>
