    <title>CMV: Schools should place as much emphasis on developing children's mental health as they do on academic learning.</title>
    <original_poster>Starrcade87</original_poster>
    <original_post>I think the goal of the education system should be to help children grow into healthy adults. 

Academic learning is good, but I would argue that it's actually less important than learning how to take care of yourself and your mental health.  For instance, most people will never touch algebra again after their formal education ends, but being mentally healthy is something that will serve us all our lives.

How should this be achieved?  I don't know exactly, but a few ideas:

\- Keep licensed therapists on staff at every school, and give every child at least 1 hour per week of dedicated therapy time, and more for students who are troubled.

\- Allow students to take at least 1 hour of outdoor sports and recreation per day.  Getting exercise and sunshine is vital for us to feel happy as humans.

\- Teach students valuable life skills that they will need as adults.  Things like managing finances, nutrition, cooking, and sex ed.  This may seem a bit off topic at first glance, but financial stability, fitness, and family planning play a huge role in your quality of life as an adult.

In other words, school shouldn't just about math, reading, and science.  Spend time and effort developing kids as people and not only will they be healthier, they'll learn better too.</original_post>

    <text>I agree with your second and third bullets. But not your first.

I loved school, and while I'm extroverted, I don't like discussing personal issues. Every single therapist or counselor I've come across (none voluntarily, and most encountered through school) is utterly convinced that this is a flaw, that I'm bottling everything up, that it'll ruin me eventually. Needless to say, I do not enjoy talking to them and am quite pleased with my life even in their absence and they haven't been proved correct yet. 

I would *dread* that one hour I'd have to spend talking to a therapist. It should be voluntary. Voluntary counseling has better outcomes anyway, not to mention it's cheaper to provide and *already exists.* </text>
