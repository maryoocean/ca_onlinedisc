    <title>CMV: Ubers should not be able to use air fresheners.</title>

    <original_post>Especially those tree air fresheners should not be allowed. While some people are bothered by the smell, that is only one of many issues. Other issues:

1) They are highly toxic. The ones that get hung from the dashboard are largely unregulated and release concentrated doses of ingredients such as formaldehyde in a contained space. This is actually unsafe for both the drivers and passengers, similar to second hand smoke.

2) They can cause immediate breathing problems for people with asthma or other serious breathing problems.

3) We don't want to increase respiratory stress on people when we still haven't gotten control of an international respiratory illness.

4) Most don't get rid of smells, only add more smells. Anyone who thinks they are going to cover up old fast food or scented Juul or cigarettes or vomit is kidding themselves</original_post>

    <text>Just open the windows or ask to have the windows open.

If you want air freshers to be gone, you can write to the actual air freshener companies about it to change the way they make them.

Telling ubers to stop using them when the problem is how it's made seems like you're kind of pitting the complaint on the the wrong company.</text>
