    <title>CMV: While musical taste is subjective, there can be an objective nature to the quality of music.</title>
    <original_poster>ZosoGG</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let me start by saying my overarching premise for this CMV.

Music quality can be determined roughly by the question "If I were to sit down with an instrument (guitar,piano,midi keyboard, DAW, etc.) for 30 minutes, would I be able to make this song?"

I know this seems pretty arbitrary, and its not a hard and fast rule, but it should serve as a good guiding mindset for how I feel about this topic and my best attempt to try create an objective quantifier of "good" music, in a subject that clearly has too many variables to be able to effectively analyse quantitatively. 

I've believed this for a long time and was just reminded of it the other day. I was at a friends place and he put on some trap music, I'm not sure who it was (Lil' Uzi Vert?). Anyway, this guy was super psyched about how awesome the album was, and I was open to listening. Pretty quickly I started to become quite amused at the content. To start off, hip hop beats are quite simplistic. This isn't a problem since I actually really like the simplicity of it and think it's quite enjoyable. However, despite my ability to subjectively enjoy the music, I understand that the beats are nothing groundbreaking. The same samples from 80's songs I've heard in many different rap songs, with a basic bass snare beat in 4/4 time, obviously repeating the same measure(s) for the duration of the song. 

Now the lyrics. I actually have never cared much for lyrics in rap songs, because it is not really what we are discussing at this point. Music is the domain of rhythms and pitches, while lyrics are a poetic pursuit. While I will concede that one can implement some singing and rhythm (flow) into their rapping, it is not largely the point of rapping. But even so, the lyrics were legitimately making me laugh. Nursery rhymes about drugs and repeating the same lines about 'Dubai' or something, with very little variation in word usage. While this is probably the hardest part of my CMV to argue because I don't have an opinion on "lyrical quality", I will refer back to my initial statement at the top and try to come up with, what I believe, would by 'bars' of similar quality as I am sitting and typing this post.

Got that bitch wet,
Make my dick big,
Dont you fucking fret,
Make my dick big

I reserve intellectual property on this btw so don't take it^. This took my less than a minute. 

Also, the background 'singer' sounds were mostly the bread and butter of trap music today. Lot's of "scurrr" car screeching sounds and high pitched "ohhs!" or just repeating the last part of a line. It was comical to say the least.

However, I'd like to stay with what I'm comfortable with, and that is music theory. From a music theoretical point of view, these songs are very simplistic. If you haven't studied western music theory at all, it is pretty standard how it is taught. You have the major scale and its modes, the most popular being the Aeolian or minor scale. From these you can make basic triad chords from each point in the scale with the other scale notes. Many chords progressions are standardized. For example, the I IV V in blues is one of the most influential and common chord progression in popular music. The I V vi IV is also extremely common. With this knowledge, one can sit down and write a blues song in 5 minutes (not bashing on blues music btw, just saying its pretty simple to make). Just pick a key (doesnt really matter), play your I IV and V as you please (probably 12 bar blues), and add in some little spice with various other notes in the pentatonic scale as you see fit, and add lyrics. Boom. Blues song.

Now, most people are very ignorant to music theory, and if they were to hear someone playing a song like that, they might actually think "wow, you're really good!". But the reality is, the effort and time put into that song was minimal and in my book that's kind of a shitty song. 

Obviously I've gotten off track from the trap song/ genre in general, but its not really a central point of my argument, I just thought it was a cool way of presenting it. This same logic applies to some (not all) trap songs. And some (not all) blues songs. And some (not all) really any genre of songs. How much of this song is just a copy of some melodic ideas that someone else already explored before? How much is just copy paste from standard western music theoretical frameworks? Could I improvise this song? Or better yet, *did* the person basically improvise this song? These are all questions I think that can be legitimately asked to answer a question many believe to be unanswerable which is "does this song suck?". 

Look, I guess it might be impossible, but it all comes down to how one would define "suck". If by "suck" we mean that the artist used minimal brainpower, talent, and creativity to make the song, than I think it is possible to at least *try* to answer the question objectively. Why is it that we try to rate performances in the olympics in certain categories such as diving and gymnastics in terms subjective ratings from judges, but as soon as someone tries to rate different types of music on general quality, people get all defensive with "hey man music is subjective". You're right, musical taste is subjective. But are we really going to sit here and pretend that the musical talent of someone like Mozart is incomparable to an artist like Waka Flocka Flame? I mean *technically* one can say that it's impossible, but what if I were to say that I, having never done gymnastics in my life, am not objectively worse than a gymnast having won 3 gold medals at the olympics because the talent and quality of the performance is just too hard to quantify, too many variables. 

Keep in mind, to be intellectually honest and consistent, I do not act like I know the answer to how to rate one song definitively better than another. It is a difficult if not impossible pursuit. I realize that leaving ratings up to certain judges leaves a lot of subjective bias into the mix, and there really is not quantifiable way to say how good one song is. What I am simply saying is that, there is a large gray area in music, but there are some songs that are either black and white, good or bad. A kind of common sense argument, if you will. And that while I don't know the answers, there is some kind of metric out there than can categorize these songs into a good or bad category. Or maybe, more appropriately, a 'bad' and 'not bad' category. And with that, I leave you all with this

    <text>Former Music Major here (in Composition). I've put a lot of thought into the distinction between subjective and objective, and I hope I can convince you that musical quality is an entirely subjective experience.

**Is quality a measure of the producer's skill?**

You say: 

&amp;gt;Music quality can be determined roughly by the question "If I were to sit down with an instrument (guitar,piano,midi keyboard, DAW, etc.) for 30 minutes, would I be able to make this song?"

This seems to suggest that you would measure quality of music based on the difficulty of producing that music. I'll bet that a brief consideration of your favorite music will put that idea to rest. I don't have the technical experience to produce most of the mixes and distinct timbres that I hear in hip hop music, and yet I love Bach's Prelude #1 from The Well Tempered Clavier, incredibly simple though it may be. I value that first prelude (and other ultra-simple pieces like The Merry Peasant, Clapping Music, or many two-part inventions) over half the grand orchestral works I hear, even though the orchestral works took orders of magnitude more effort to produce.

**Is quality a measure of innovation?**

You say:

&amp;gt;How much of this song is just a copy of some melodic ideas that someone else already explored before? How much is just copy paste from standard western music theoretical frameworks?

This suggests a different standard: that musical quality should be measured by how unique the piece is, and how much it diverges from past frameworks. This, of course, means throwing out Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, etc, each of whom were firmly steeped in the musical traditions of their past (and even saw themselves this way. Mozart, for example, saw his music as merely an attempt to slightly improve on Haydn.) This would also mean that *avant-garde* music would very obviously always be the best quality, no contest. I don't think most listeners would back up that point of view.

**Is quality a measure of planning?**

You say:

&amp;gt;Could I improvise this song? Or better yet, did the person basically improvise this song? 

This suggests a third standard: that the quality of music is determined by how well-planned the performance is. Again, I think a brief review of music would show this to be false. Expert jazz improvisations seem to be much more moving, exciting, interesting, and passionate than a lot of boring-but-well-planned string quartets. 

**Wrap-up: What is subjective?**

Altogether, let me suggest to you that scrambling between different objective standards is a dead giveaway of subjectivity. Yes, you're right that there a "Can be an objective nature" to music quality, but with such vague language, this observation could be applied to absolutely any subjective measurement. There "can be an objective nature" to the question of which ice cream is tastiest. There "can be an objective nature" to which Gilligan's Island character is 'the best'. But by any reasonable split of what is  'subjective' and what is 'objective', these things are best classified as subjective. And so is musical quality.
