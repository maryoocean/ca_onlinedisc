    <title>CMV: Activists should abandon the phrase "white privilege" because it alienates white people who didn't grow up wealthy</title>
    <original_poster>ShiningConcepts</original_poster>
    <original_post>Blacks are [more than twice as likely to grow up in poverty](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;amp;sortModel=%7B"colId":"Location","sort":"asc"%7D), [disproportionately sentenced for the same crimes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/16/black-men-sentenced-to-more-time-for-committing-the-exact-same-crime-as-a-white-person-study-finds/?utm_term=.b0e81ca325dc), [several percentage points ahead in terms of unemployment statistics](https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpsee_e16.htm), prone disproportionately to police arrests incl. for nonviolent drug usage, and the list goes on. There are a wide variety of issues minority rights activists bring up that are legitimate - I'm not here to dispute those. I fully support that fight.

My view here is that the usage of the phrase "white privilege" is wrong and should be retired. Many upper class white people are privileged as they are immune to the ripple effects of a racist history (and the modern day effects of racist police departments and shitty schools in minority neighborhoods). But for the poor white ones, which there are many, the phrase white privilege should be abandoned. Because it minimizes and implies less importance for the suffering countless poor white people had to go through - while blacks are disproportionately victims of all the things i mentioned, some whites are the victims of them to.

I understand why a white person who suffered hardship in their life would feel alienated by hearing someone throw around the term "white privilege" - the term asserts there is a privilege in being white. There is privilege in being rich, but not solely in being white. So, the term should be abandoned in the interest of not alienating poor white people from a legitimate movement that has legitimate concerns.

No, some white people are not victims of ALL the things you listed. They are not victims of the things that are racial discrimination.

A poor white person and a poor black person may have had just as dangerous neighborhoods and just as shitty schools and are just as likely to deal drugs, but the poor white man is *not* just as likely to be arrested as the poor black man and the poor white man is *not* just as likely to be convicted as the poor black man and the poor white man is *not* just as likely to be shot by police or pulled over for looking suspicious or stopped and frisked as the poor black man. 

No matter how shitty the situation a white person is born into, that white person (in America) still doesn't ever have to face the racial discrimination that a black person faces *on top* of the situation they were born into. 

Even wealthy black people face racial discrimination. "White privilege" is the opposite of "discriminatory treatment." It is not the opposite of "poor." While a lot of racial issues involve economics, they don't all involve it. A lot of racial issues have nothing to do with economics. </text>
