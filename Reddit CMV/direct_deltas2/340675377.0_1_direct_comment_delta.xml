    <title>CMV: Modern office jobs makes you a Robot. And there's nothing you can do about it.</title>
    <original_poster>turbo_runner</original_poster>
    <original_post>Hello.  I'd like to say that I work in an programming job, so I've experienced beforehand what I'm about to describe.

First of all, I know there's nothing new about it, people were doing monotonous tasks in the past, typing all day long or filling forms by hand. It hasn't changed at all, maybe the difference is that most things are done by a computer now.

However after working for more than a year in the same place, doing the same thing for 5 or 6 days, sometimes working extra-hours so the company can have a report that no one is going to read but they "need it". Can create in the individual a sense of emptiness, Some might cope with it by staying with their family, or going out with friends, but in the end, it's going to be the same thing after the weekend or vacations are over. 

The individual then, needs to go back to work, and continue with the same routine, year after year, until they either retire, or die. 

So in a sense, those working in a cubicle are robots, we're all robots, because we do the same thing until we break down and they replace us. 

Of course one might get this sense of "meaningless" in any job, white or blue collar, but working in a corporate job gives you that feeling sooner. 

That being said, I believe there's nothing we can do, so we can only work until we die. Please CMV.

    <text>Have you looked into the Financial Independence/Early Retirement movement?

Basically, if you save 1/2 your pay, you buy 1 year of freedom for each year working. At 3/4 savings rate, you buy 3 years per year.

So no, you don't have to work until you die if your wants are reduced, and you save money.</text>
