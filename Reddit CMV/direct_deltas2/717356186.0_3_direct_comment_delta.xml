    <title>CMV: Competition in the Online Streaming Market is ultimately worse for consumers</title>
    <original_poster>Stark1162</original_poster>
    <original_post>Competition is generally a good thing in most markets. Having many companies in the same market fuels innovation and brings down prices. While this is true for most markets like Smartphones, Automobiles and Air travel, it's not the case for Online Streaming. 

When you subscribe to a streaming service like Netflix, you're offered access to a number of shows and movies, most of which are licensed from content producers. When there are fewer players in the market, a streaming service like Netflix can make licensing deals with a majority  of the original content producers out there, giving the consumers access to a multitude of content. But when number of Online Streaming services increases, the content is distributed among them due to 'exclusive' deals. So if you're interested in watching 10 different TV series that air on 5 different streaming services, you are forced to choose one of these three options:

1. Get subscribed to all 5 services which will cost a lot of money per month

OR

2. Give up on some of your favourite shows to keep your expenses down.

OR

3. Piracy: Which will ultimately harm the original content creators.

Moreover, an increasing number of production studios are getting into the streaming game, like HBO and  Disney with Disney+, making the scenario more fragmented, by offering their original content exclusively on their platforms.

This situation not only makes it more expensive for the consumers but the content producers as well who may be potentially losing viewership money because the consumers are forced to choose between several competitors</original_post>

    <text>This is an issue of not enough competition. Right now, streaming is operating under an oligopolistic competition. There are a few companies offering streaming services, all priced fairly similarly, and they compete through things such product differentiation - i.e. Netflix has these shows, Hulu has these different shows, and Prime Video has these other different shows. If a few streaming services dropped out, then there would be one or two services left, who would either find a common middle ground for pricing (likely well above what we pay for each service now), or engage in a price war until one closes down and the other can charge whatever it would like. Conversely, if you add more streaming services, production companies would see how beneficial it would be to not exclusively contract with one service, and begin offering their shows and movies to more services, thus solving the issue you have with streaming right now. 


This is a basic economic concept. Oligopolies work very well for things such as cell phones, and cars. Physical objects where there is tangible benefit from one over the other. They don't work as well for services such as cable, internet/cellular, and now streaming. These would all be much better as perfectly competitive markets, with relatively little product differentiation. The issue with how it applies to streaming is that streaming is resource heavy - you can't just open a streaming company on the dime. It takes a lot of server resources to do well. And that's the primary issue. There are very high barriers to entry for the streaming market. So while us as consumers would benefit a great deal from having 10 or 15 more reliable options, it doesn't seem plausible for the time being.</text>
