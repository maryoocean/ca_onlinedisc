    <title>CMV: God could be either benevolent or omnipotent, but not both.</title>
    <original_poster>TaterTotsBandit</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have yet to see an argument that adequately explains the existence of suffering in the face of a benevolent, omnipotent God.

Provided God were both of these things, it wouldn't have created suffering in the first place. There wouldn't have been a need. To say that a God had to necessarily do something makes it no longer omnipotent.

I often see people say that suffering serves a purpose, such as bringing us closer to God or giving life meaning.

But once again, if the God were both benevolent and omnipotent, suffering wouldn't have had to be created in the first place. An emotion humans perceive as positive could just as easily take its place. If you claim otherwise, then that God is either no longer omnipotent or no longer benevolent.

No longer omnipotent because it can't get rid of a negative emotion, no longer benevolent because it can and chooses not to.


Edit 1: my opinion hasn't been changed but I've learned new concepts and been introduced to some novel ones, so the thread was still a success!!!

I decided to stop answer as most responses are currently bringing up free will, but the concept of that is for another thread entirely. 

I respect what others are saying, but i feel like ones conclusions about free will and the benevolence of creation is completely experience based. As such, I don't see a point in arguing over it as you can't change someone's life experience.

I'm still reading the responses, and will answer any that I feel I didn't address elsewhere in the thread.

Thank you all for your responses!

Edit 2: upon answering (I hope) every comment so far, it seems free will is more closely tied to benevolence than I'd originally realized. So I'll make a separate thread about that once I make my thoughts up on it (free will is one of those things that scare me, lol, so give me time pls).</original_post>

    <text>So, as some have said: the definition of “omnipotent” becomes really important.  If there are certain things that are required for the sake of pleasure, in every possible configuration of the universe, then a being could still be able to do anything that’s logically possible...and yet face real restrictions in being able to help.

Scott Alexander popularized what might be the best counterargument to make, in both his blog SlateStarCodex and his web serial Unsong.  He says that if god’s goal is to create as much happiness as possible, then he ought to create every universe that contains happiness, where the happiness is enough to make the pain worthwhile.  So, if there’s a possible universe where people can get tortured, but also most people throughout all of history can be deeply happy to a large degree, then the people of that universe deserve the chance to exist.  Kind of like a cosmic Omelas argument.

Not to say this isn’t controversial: in reality, I actually agree with you, for reasons I can clarify below if you like.  But it does make sense that an omnibenevolent god might, by virtue of knowing everything, be in a situation where it needs to create a world with some suffering in order to allow for the existence of even more joy.  Can’t say I’d personally do it, but I could see it being the “right” answer despite my current perspective.</text>
