    <title>CMV: Kids today are losing the ability to express themselves effectively</title>

    <original_post>Since writing is an important tool of communication it is important to learn the process without the help of paraphrasing from the writings of others and arriving at ideas naturally. most kids don't write using their own ideas, they search the internet and arrange the writings of other people into an essay. The effect of this method of writing papers is harmful because if they don't arrive at ideas naturally and write them in their own words they will not be able to write or know proper grammar without the help of technology. </original_post>

    <text>I think kids today express themselves better than in the past. They are out spoken and educated and passionate. I grew up in a time when children were supposed to be seen and not heard and were told to only speak when spoken to and only be polite and agreeable. I much prefer the way children are today.

I also don't think proper grammar is the most important aspect of a paper. The ideas are what matter most and how they are put together and explained.

If you teach a class and think children don't have their own ideas maybe start doing discussion groups after readings and make them spend time thinking about things. Many students are totally able to come up with their own ideas on topics they care about, but for a boring assignment they may be more likely to just not care.</text>
