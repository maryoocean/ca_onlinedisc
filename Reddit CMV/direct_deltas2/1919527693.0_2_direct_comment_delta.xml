    <title>CMV: Downfall of News Networks is a Good Thing</title>
    <original_poster>mindtug</original_poster>
    <original_post>News thrives off fear mongering which has been detrimental for America. For instance ‘stranger danger’ caused kids across America to be locked indoors which isn’t great for development and mental health because the fear of some van taking them away, while the likelihood of your kids being kidnapped is actually extremely low. Same thing with tough on crime that went overboard causing mass incarceration and lengthened prison times making America have the biggest prisoner poppulation in the world. News talk about “How we’re more divided than ever” but they’re probably the biggest contributors. It’s important to know what’s happening but global networks such as CNN and Fox are too sensational for me to support. Should I feel sad they’re dying?</original_post>

    <text>The question is what has replaced them as sources of information? in most cases it is YouTube, social media, podcasts, etc. 

YouTube and social media link and rank content based on engagement: the more people who click through, watch, comment, like, share etc. The more the algorithm will push that content. Unfortunately thanks to the quirks of human psychology outage and anger cause humans to respond the most, so extremist, divisive, misleading information gets pushed by the algorithm.

In short, the issues with news networks fearmongering are dialed up to 100 on the sources that replace them, with basically no oversight on accuracy or balance. This has forced networks to compete with this garbage by emulating them.</text>
