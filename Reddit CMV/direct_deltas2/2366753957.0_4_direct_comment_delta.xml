    <title>CMV: Most lesbians are butch (looking very masculine)</title>
    <original_poster>clavicle524</original_poster>
    <original_post>Many people consider it a negative stereotype that lesbians act very masculine or dress in a masculine way. I disagree. I believe most if not all lesbians are butch and there is no such thing as a lesbian who dresses very feminine. While a lesbian who dresses in a masculine way (short hair, traditional male clothing) and is feminine can exist, a lesbian who looks feminine (long, flowing hair, clear skin, a narrow waist, traditional female dress, and clothing, and little or no body hair or facial hair) does not exist. I’ve searched far and wide for lesbians who look very feminine but I couldn’t find anything. Just to let you guys know, I’m not saying being a butch lesbian or being masculine is bad. I’m merely stating why I believe the stereotype of Lesbians looking masculine is very true.

Edit: I've changed my view now thanks to the sources and the information people gave me. If you wish to challenge another aspect of my view, please read the delta log of my post first ([https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaLog/comments/1354bnm/deltas\_awarded\_in\_cmv\_most\_lesbians\_are\_butch/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaLog/comments/1354bnm/deltas_awarded_in_cmv_most_lesbians_are_butch/)) so you don't use the other arguments the other commentators used before.</original_post>

    <text>You're assuming the presentation is entirely rigid. For starters, there are more than just butches and femmes. There are many lesbians out there that are femme but there are also plenty of lesbians that are in the middle as well. So you cannot collect data on how many lesbians present a certain way because some present in many different ways, some are androgynous, and not all lesbians will answer. Even the lesbians you consider butch probably present femininely sometimes and vice versa.

But you cannot deny that there are many feminine lesbians out there, you just aren't looking in the right places for them. Especially considering how many relationships you'd see where one person is masculine and the other is feminine, you would see way more butches dating if there weren't feminine lesbians out there.

If you want examples of lesbians that aren't butch, look up Kehlani, Hayley Kiyoko, and Portia De Rossi (she has short hair but otherwise often dresses femininely).</text>
