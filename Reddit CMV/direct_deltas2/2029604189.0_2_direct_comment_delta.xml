    <title>CMV: Sustainability, from a philosophical perspective, is misguided</title>
    <original_poster>Pyropeace</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've been an advocate of sustainability for a while. However, I've recently begun to question the underlying assumptions behind the sustainability movement. 

Nothing is truly, infinitely sustainable. The sun will eventually go nova, killing everyone on earth (if humans haven't already gone extinct by then). If humanity manages to escape Earth, then the universe will likely perish as well, depending on what model you accept. The universe is in a constant state of change, and nothing lasts forever. Is it better to be moderately happy for a long period of time or extremely happy for a short period of time? When talking about entire societies, I tend towards the latter, though on an individual basis I tend towards the former. 

Essentially, my question is this; what is the value in things that last a long time in a universe where nothing is eternal?</original_post>

    <text>&amp;gt;Essentially, my question is this; what is the value in things that last a long time in a universe where nothing is eternal?

Let's scale this down to answer.

Why do you invest time into having to get an education as a youth?

Many children rather than school and examinations would rather hedonistically just play around rather than have to provide for family like is the case in many 3rd world countries. We do so anyways because we recognize that schooling is necessary in order to both improve the child's quality of life in the future as well as for the child's own ability to survive in their future. Even if they are unhappy for a brief period, it is worth it for the next 30-60 years.

You can't just play around and be illiterate all your childhood and then decide when you're 30 years old that you want to be able to be able to support yourself since you lack the cultivation of prerequisite skills from education. Your 'extremely happy for a short period of time' decision has now affected your ability to be 'moderately happy' for the remainder of your life.

Now with respect to sustainability, if we consider our society to be an adolescent, why would we not invest in not just the next generation - but the current generation.  Concepts such as sustainability are not just an investment into hundreds and thousands of years into the future... they're concepts that affect us decades from now which is not far off.

For example we've only been able to not starve to death as a species at the current population levels [thanks to technological developments 100 years ago into ammonia production](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1918/summary/)

TL;DR Investing in the future affects not just future generations but future you directly.</text>
