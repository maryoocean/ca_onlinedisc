    <title>CMV: America doesn't need more STEM majors.</title>
    <original_poster>brotherhood4232</original_poster>
    <original_post>I used to follow the Reddit consensus that STEM = good and "basket weaving" majors = bad. I graduated with an electrical engineering degree myself. But after looking for a job myself, it doesn't seem like the job market could support a ton of more STEM majors.

I've seem very few job postings that said Entry Level. Most want 3\-5 years of experience and a host of qualifications that no new graduate will have. This means you are not only competing against other new graduates, but you are also competing against Mid\-Level STEM professionals. I think a flood of new STEM graduates would exacerbate this problem and a lot of those new engineers would be working at Starbucks. Change my view.</original_post>

    <text>I think you're going to see a very different situation in about 6 months or so. I live in an area with a lot of defense contractors who employ vast quantities of engineers. Everyone I know is telling me about the unprecedented numbers of interns their companies have hired, the number of senior staff that have been poached away by other companies, and the massive number of people they need to hire. 

Why? The bump to the defense budget this year was large! That means a lot of new contracts for the same number of people.  All the companies want experienced new hires so they can hit the ground running, but there aren't enough experienced people. Soon, they'll give up on the ideal and start scrabbling more fiercely for warm bodies.</text>
