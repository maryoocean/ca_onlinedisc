    <title>CMV: I should turn my car off at stop lights</title>
    <original_poster>Sleeper_in_the_code</original_poster>
    <original_post>I currently do not have a job, and will not be able to get a good one for a few years (I am in school and a bad student, so I need as few distractions as I can afford), and want to save money where I can. My commute has two (sometimes three) lights where I might have to wait for up to about two and a half minutes to get moving again, idling for that whole time. Seems to me that that is wasted gas, since I am not going anywhere but my engine is running. 

However, I have never seen anyone do this, so I can not help but feel like I am missing something obvious as to why I should not do this. 

I want to save gas, and therefore money, but I also want to avoid doing anything dangerous or illegal. 

Maybe this is a question for a different sub, but I have no idea where else I should go, and this seems like something that could be discussed. 

Edit: yep, I’m convinced. Saving money by not idling isn’t really worth the drawbacks, and if I’m really concerned, I should look into a car that is supposed to do this (a few years from now when I hopefully have more money). </original_post>

    <text>It's a bad idea because in the event of an emergency requiring you to move, such as an ambulance you'll take up more time starting your car and getting it to move than just moving. Additionally it's much more common for a car to just not start than it is for a car to randomly die. So by shutting it off you're increasing the chances that your car will not be able to move in either an emergency or for a green light, which sucks for you and sucks for everyone else/could be dangerous.</text>
