    <title>CMV:I believe torture to be perfectly ok if guilt is established beyond reasonable doubt.</title>
    <original_poster>Disgustingoldslob</original_poster>
    <original_post>Simple as the title, I believe that if someone is guilty of a serious crime against another (rape, murder, child abuse, etcetc) the victim or the family of the victim should be legally allowed to torture the guilty party as part of the punishment. I do not believe doing so lowers you to the level of the guilty, as you would be acting out violence on someone who harmed an innocent, while they were completely unjustified in their actions. I also do not believe the moral objections of others should interfere with the legal right of the family/victim.

Edit for clarification, I don't believe it should be mandatory, but I believe it should be an available option. I'm speaking of cases in which guilt is almost perfectly assured. (e.g sound witness testimony, DNA, caught in the act, admission of guilt, etc.)

    <text>Ignoring the morality and benefits behind allowing people to torture others, I'm going to address the "beyond reasonable doubt" part.

We already require guilty verdicts beyond reasonable doubt to send people to prison, to stay there for life or be executed. And yet innocent people are constantly ending up there by accident. You can't say torture is OK only if we know for a fact they're guilty because we can never know. Everyone on death row is there because we KNEW they were guilty. Except some aren't. As technology advances and cases are revisited we continually free wrongly imprisoned people.

If torture is only allowed for the TRULY guilty, does that mean that everyone else in the system is only KINDA guilty? It doesn't work like that. Everyone must be judged as being 100% truly guilty to receive a punishment.

The idea works in theory, in your head, but in reality it will never be possible because we will end up torturing innocent people, just like we end up sending them to prison or death row despite believing they're guilty.</text>
