    <title>CMV: I consider the Nordic model the best socio-economic model to base a country around &amp;amp; the best compromise between the right and left</title>

I believe the free market combined with a social safety net reduces poverty which benefits everyone. High level of education, highly efficient administration effectively invests into the society, providing multiple incentives and angles of growth.  

People have trust in their government, in their administration and how their taxes are used. This leads to a high level of security; problems are laid off them and ultimately this leads to a high level of happiness.   

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report  

Low level of income inequality, high GDP and PPP per capita, liberal laws, low crime, low corruption, good healthcare, great education, low pollution. What's not to like?  

But all this does not obstruct high profit businesses from investing and all that is asked from businesses is that they treat their employees with respect and pay them enough so they can make a decent living. True, most thrift-based businesses would be discouraged from investing but Imo in the developed country there should be no place for such an exploiting business style.  

My only doubt is whether such a model could adapt to a larger country because in all Nordic cases we deal with low populations, large areas and often, decent levels of natural resources and admittedly this does create conditions for easier administration and sustainable economic growth.  

CMV, thanks in advance!

    <text>&amp;gt; My only doubt is whether such a model could adapt to a larger country because in all Nordic cases we deal with low populations

Assuming that population size does effect the viability of the Nordic model, consider that the [median population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population) in Nordic countries is 5.4 million while the median for all countries is 4.6 million, and (for reference) the median US state is also 4.6 million. So assuming it doesn't scale up, half the countries in the world, or half of all US states, could use the Nordic model.

&amp;gt; large areas

While true, its somewhat misleading as [51% of that is uninhabitable glacier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_countries) so their effective density is likely much higher than simple statistics would suggest.

&amp;gt;  decent levels of natural resources

According to [this listing](http://www.thecountriesof.com/top-10-countries-with-most-natural-resources-in-the-world/) none of the Nordic countries are in the top 10 for natural resources, and in fact the median Nordic country is [below the median overall country](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.TOTL.RT.ZS?order=wbapi_data_value_2012+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;amp;sort=desc) for %GDP from natural resources.</text>
