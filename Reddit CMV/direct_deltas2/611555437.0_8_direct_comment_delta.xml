    <title>CMV: Businesses have no logical reason to give an employee a good review.</title>
    <original_poster>scroopynoopersdid911</original_poster>
    <original_post>Why would they? so that they have to give you more money? it serves no logical reason to give an employee a good review. If the point of the business is to squeeze any potential value out of eery employee why would they allow an employee to have something to point to when asking for a raise. In my case, my review has been deferred for another year because they won't give me a bad one and they know i'll ask for more money. Anyway, cmv businesses have no logical reason to give a good review. 


EDIT: Thanks for all the career advice. I actually like where i work and i do not think ill be leaving. this is not a veiled attempt to make me feel better or whatever. i'm just wondering from a logical standpoint. so..... you guys can stop making this a "lets give op career advice" thread.

EDIT 1: I will reduce my view to simply "is it not easier to replace an employee, and/or keep them unhappy as oppose to giving good reviews and higher wages". i will point to Amazon and Walmart as examples. I agree that predominant management theory says "keep them happy, they will work harder" but i haven't really seen much evidence to support that yet other then theory.

Resolution: MY view has changed, i award a delta to every reply i got.</original_post>

    <text>Businesses give good reviews despite the ability to give raises as a small (though sometimes unappreciated) token that shows they care about the employee and the work they do.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Especially in giant organizations where the work product of an individual can very easily get lost in the machine.  Having a supervisor take the time and show they took the time to consider the employee's contribution, make it known to that employee that they contribute to the success of the company's products, and that they are valuable can go a long way in dulling the sting of another year of no raises, constant assault on benefits, unrelenting changes in direction and instruction, and never ending bureaucracy.

Don't believe it?
