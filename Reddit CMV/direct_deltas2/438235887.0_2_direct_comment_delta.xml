    <title>CMV: If gender is a social construct, then so is race</title>
    <original_poster>BoppeBoye</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let us take, as a given, that gender is divorced from the circumstances of your birth, that it is not a mental illness, and that there is no biological basis for what gender identity someone should express. Have I phrased that effectively? I'm trying to be concise, but I want to portray that premise correctly.

Why, then, should race be different than gender? If race carries with it "shared experience" and "lived experience", etc - that assumes that the only way you could understand what it's like to be a minority is to have lived your entire life as that particular minority. I'm not arguing against that, I agree that there are certain experiences that I could not comprehend - for instance, overbearing &amp;amp; strict Asian parents with exceedingly high expectations. 

But, if someone can change their gender or decide (?) that they identify as a different gender without having the prior lived experience of said gender, then why can't someone identify as a different race?

I'm not able to encompass all the variables which could lead someone to identify as another gender, but is it not possible for someone to come to the same conclusion with their race? What if an Indian man grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood, saw or experienced the same (or similar) discrimination as them, had minimal exposure to Indian culture; and this led him to conclude that he identifies more closely as a black man, rather than Indian? 

I would also like to cite Rachel Dolezal, who was uniformly mocked for being (afaik) the first trans-black woman in the public eye. It seems similar to transgender discrimination to me, assuming that there is something wrong with her mentally for deciding to become a black woman... Anyway, I'm not really defending her because that's not really in line with what I described in the previous paragraph (she grew up privileged IIRC), but the public reaction of mockery goes against the leftist belief of acceptance, by my perspective.

So, in short, why can there be no such thing as trans-racial people, the same way there are transgender?

    <text>&amp;gt; Have I phrased that effectively? 

Not quite.  Gender is not divorced from the circumstances of ones birth, nor from ones biology.  People's gender and sex are correlated but it's not 1 to 1 (this is setting aside other cultural conceptions of third genders) because there are many other factors involved.

&amp;gt;Why, then, should race be different than gender? If race carries with it "shared experience" and "lived experience", etc - that assumes that the only way you could understand what it's like to be a minority is to have lived your entire life as that particular minority. I'm not arguing against that, I agree that there are certain experiences that I could not comprehend - for instance, overbearing &amp;amp; strict Asian parents with exceedingly high expectations. 
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;But, if someone can change their gender or decide (?) that they identify as a different gender without having the prior lived experience of said gender, then why can't someone identify as a different race?

The main reason that this is considered so taboo is that changing ones race can sometimes be seen as dismissing or ignoring the shared cultural struggles of a racial group. Rachel Dolezal wasn't considered offensive because she "identified as black", it was that she was changing what is generally considered an immutable characteristic linked to cultural experiences, many if which are negative. 

To put it simply, I bet there were a lot of black (or mixed race) people during slavery or the Jim crow era that wished they could identify as white, but they didn't have that luxury.  Even today black people in America face all kinds of adversity.  Rachel Dolezal minimized that kind of suffering by essentially joining a group without paying the price, for lack of a good way to phrase it. 

If there are people who "identify" as a different race, I would have to look more into the issue before forming a stronger opinion about how they should be regarded because I'm not totally sure what Kinds of factors would cause that.  But if it does turn out that being "trans racial" is a thing, and there is some kind of "race dysphoria", then I'd be totally for finding effective ways to help them, even if it means "transitioning".  At the moment, though, there is no evidence that that's the case, so it just looks like somebody is minimizing the struggle of black people by deciding what race they want to be. 

**edit:** Many people have replied to this comment by essentially saying that I'm claiming black people have it worse than women and that's why I think being "trans-racial" is worse.  To clarify, I do not think either is worse. The nature of oppression experienced by black people is rooted in a specific history. Not just a history of oppression, but a specific, traceable history, which is why I think it is different than the oppression experienced by women in general (you could make an argument that certain groups of women have specific, traceable oppression, though). My point here wasn't to try and convince everybody that one is worse than the other, just that there is a difference between how oppression relates to racial identity and how it relates to gender identity, and that that difference is likely a part of what causes such distinct reactions. It has nothing to do with something being socially constructed or not, as in the OP.</text>
