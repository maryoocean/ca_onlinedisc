    <title>CMV: A rationing system not unlike what Britain had during WW2 would be beneficial for the US.</title>
    <original_poster>RedShocktrooper</original_poster>
    <original_post>In the aftermath of WW1 Britain looked at their rationing system during the war, and concluded that there was... lots of work that could be done. During WW2, they had a whole section of their government basically devoted to making sure that, damn the U-Boats and the Blitz, they were going to keep everyone fed. This also caused a bit of a dietary shift, but as a result of the rationing it should be noted that *food quality increased* and life expectancy (when it wasn't truncated by bombings and long-range rocket strikes) actually went up on average. Admittedly, this came a the price of making food not too terribly exciting (thus mock duck and mock chicken) which to be fair probably discouraged overeating.  


Given the current tendency for cheap food to also be incredibly fattening food, a shift to a rationing system that ensured everyone had access to fresh veggies and also limited the intake of any one person's would result in an upward trend in general US health. Though, since we're not in a "enemy nation flying bomber runs over our cities and sinking our transport ships" situation at the moment there is no need for it to be so stringent.</original_post>

    <text>In a vacuum, if you could *poof* wave a magic wand and just make this happen, maybe you might have a point.

There aren't any wizards who can use magic wands or genies who can grant wishes in reality, though. Your argument completely ignores the practical steps that the US government would need to take in order to implement this kind of a system in peacetime.

It would almost certainly be a *ridiculously* unpopular measure. We're not just talking about some soda taxes or tax breaks for eating healthy food; what you're proposing is an extreme level of control over people's dietary choices that could, IMHO, realistically be only achieved one way.

That is, if the US turned totalitarian.

Is the end worth the means? I'd say no, under no reasonable definition of the word "beneficial" can you say this would be worth it. Better nutrition in exchange for a dictatorship is, how do I put it, the worst trade deal in history of trade deals, maybe ever.

Can you just *ignore* the means and focus on the end? Only if you want for this argument to be constrained to realms of magical fantasy.</text>
