    <title>Cmv: Psychology is fucked up</title>

Any major psychological study done mostly has involved unethical and morally questionable expirements behind it. Sure many good expirements have been done without harming any organism but that doesn't cause leaps in this department of science.


Things such as fear, isolation etc have only been studied by torturing and abusing many animals and humans in the past. The breakthroughs made then make psychology research today seem slow and less conclusive.


Take for example, Harlowâ€™s Pit of Despair or Stanford Prison Expirement or The Trolley Problem  or Milgrim's shocking obidence expirement.


Most will probably know these famous expirements because of their cruelty and discoveries unlike many good and positive expirements. 



It's ironical that the feild of study which needs to understand how the brain works needs a sacrifice of morals to progress quickly.</original_post>

Isn't that true for any field of study that involves human biology?

We test theories on animals. Final steps in all of those experiments are human experiments (drug tests, experimental operations, products testing on volunteers). 

And many breakthroughs are inherently tied in to data taken from even more fucked up experiments (most of recent comes from Nazi experiments during Holocaust, Unit 731 experiments of Imperial Japan and US experiments on POC when they were considered inferior).

It seems fucked up until we realize that there is no way to omit human experimentation. No matter how we test and theorize, the topic of study is human biology and we do need to have final test on humans to confirm everything.

You need to have final test of study, done on a topic of your study. Most science fields do not create any problem with that. But anything involving human biology inherently does.

It is not fucked up, it is simply how it is. It's inevitable.</text>
