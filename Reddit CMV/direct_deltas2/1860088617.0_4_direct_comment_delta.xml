    <title>CMV: We don't possess a rational mind only to sometimes think irrationally, and we don't evolve to get here only for some of us to feel complacent not to go any further at anything.</title>

    <original_post>I don't know, it just doesn't come to me that these faults of irrationality and not wanting to improve still exist within us all. The cause of basically all the world's issues, why we never get stuff done, the one thing holding us all back. What's more perplexing is the very attempt at fixing these "faults" is seen as something very detrimental. 

A case of tall poppy syndrome? Is this the limit of our improvement? Is there some sort of a kill switch preventing us from becoming uncontrolled? Is rationality in fact the undesirable byproduct of evolution? We're given opportunity to be awesome and the right ways to get there, and we just reject them? I just need to understand what I've been missing.</original_post>

    <text>While I agree that a lot people just follow blindly their emotions, there is a problem when you think of a rational position. It's entirely depending on the values of the individual who's taking the decision. Do you value more the group or your personal well being ? Maybe your family well being ? You won't act "rationally" the same way depending on your answer. IMO, it makes it very hard to know if someone act rationaly or not.

What's your goal in life ? It depends a lot of your spirituality. I don't want to max my stats as it was a videogame, I don't think that's not rational unless you value the number of people living on earth (more efficiency means less ressources consumming) over the global quality of life (Less time chilling and socialising).

In the end, emotions are just feedbacks from your body mostly about your mental health. It would be very irrationnal not to at least listen to them. It seems logical to me that people with limited mental capacity follow them blindly.</text>
