    <title>CMV: Twitter will be transformed into a right-wing hellscape</title>
    <original_poster>newleafsauce</original_poster>
    <original_post>I fear Twitter will become yet another fringe, conspiracy-fuelled and bigoted platform like all the sites that don't moderate for misinformation or hate speech. User enjoyability will plummet and the loudest and most active sect will be those who ordinarily would be banned under the pre-Musk terms &amp;amp; conditions. 

Musk has expressed his intentions today to transform Twitter into a site that allows all free speech under the law. What does this mean? This means white supremacists, incels, misogynists, conspiracy theorists, science denialists, and anti-LGBT zealots, among other far-right groups will be able to promote the most repugnant content and disinformation, and grow their respective movements, which will inevitably spill over into the real world. They will be allowed to brigade and hate on any Twitter user who belongs to the identities they despise. And their victims can't do anything meaningful about it except to spend hours blocking harrasing accounts / DMs or to leave the platform entirely.  

The toxicity will get so bad that the  most socially-progressive people and people with non-fringe views will likely leave. Twitter will skew heavily right-wing and far-right fast under Musk. 

If you can say anything to alleviate my fears and predictions, I would be open to hearing it so I can have my mind changed on this.</original_post>

    <text>If Elon wants twitter to remain profitable (which he most likely does) the moderation rules will end up quite similar to what they are now despite his rhetoric and marketing to the contrary. People think these corporations are part of some woke agenda and that they’re trying to censor conservatives. Corporations are apolitical they only appear political at times when profits are at stake. 

People seem to think they are the customers of social media companies when in reality they are the product. The customers are the advertisers and they don’t like their ads being next to tweets about nazism, great replacement, conspiracy theories. Twitter doesn’t give af about any of this political stuff, they’re concerned about the NYT running an article about nazi’s congregating on twitter and advertisers being scared off and losing revenue. 

This is what conservatives don’t seem to understand, forcing a company to platform objectionable views is forcing a company to operate at a loss. This from the free market laissez fairecapitalists saving us from socialism</text>
