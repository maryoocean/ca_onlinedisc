    <title>CMV: People who hang around in a group are all similar to each other and people who prefer being alone are too different from the them (the former)</title>

    <original_post>**Background:**

I've seen that we have two kinds of people in life. Those who prefer to hang out in groups - no matter where they go they end up being part of a group (almost always). And those that are always alone. They tend to be alone most of the time (most of the time).

**Belief 1 that needs to be changed:**

Let me elaborate on these points. For example, in the workplace your whole department might be divided into 5 groups. Then in each of those 5 groups the people are all similar to each other. You could say that group 1 has people of type A qualities, group 2 has people of type B qualities. If group 1 has 5 people then those 5 people are more or less similar to each other. I would say 70% similar in terms of life opinions, behaviors, attitudes etc.

CMV1: This is the reason why the group people get along with each other. It's because they're all similar to each other. They're just lucky that they were born with/absorbed such common behaviors that they always find similar people, no matter where they go.

**Belief 2 that needs to be changed:**

People who prefer being alone are very different from these group-guys. Such people usually end up being alone because they are too different. Their sense of humor is different, behaviors, perceptions, opinions, tastes are all too unique. So when they hang out in a group of people they cannot relate to the conversation or behaviors - because they are too different.

CMV2: No matter how much they try, the people who prefer hanging out alone can never be part of a group. It's because they're too different to fit in. The group-guys will never understand, appreciate or respect the loner-guys. Even when they're all hanging out together. It's only a matter of time before the group-guys start belittling the loner-guys for their lack of group-socializing-skills and making judgements on their whole personalities. It's just unfortunate that the loner-guys were born/developed into tastes that were just way too unique. Group-guys will never accept loner-guys.

**In other words:** 

We all fit into 2 kinds of people. 

The group-guys - who get similar people like them no matter where they go. I'm not saying a 100% similar, but like 70% similar. You all share the same tastes across movies, songs, discussions of the workplace, attitudes towards friends and acquaintances, mannerism of talking, eating/drinking/smoking preferences, hangout location preferences. They understand each other very well and become quick-friends.

The loner-guys - who are way too unique. There's like 1 in 30 guys who are similar to them. They mostly remain alone because they cannot fit in with the group guys. They will never get to be part of any group because of this. The group guys are all similar and loner-guys are way too different.

Please help me CMV!

    <text>Part of what you are talking about is addressed by the concepts of perceived [out-group homogeneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-group_homogeneity) and in-group heterogeneity. People naturally believe that members of other groups are more similar on characteristics than is actually the case. This effect is a bias, and it directly explains your belief #1. There is no necessary reason members of a group must be especially similar to each other, especially if those groups were created by someone else (like a boss). 

I'm guessing you are more of a loner than a social person. If so, this would account for why you see such differences between people who prefer to be alone and people who are more group-oriented. The idea of in-group heterogeneity says that people believe their own groups consist of people with varied characteristics who are not all that similar to each other. Here, you aren't talking about being a member of a group. But if you identify as more of a loner, then you likely fall victim to this bias when thinking about other loners.
