    <title>CMV: Sell-side equity research is useless to retail investors to beat the market</title>
    <original_poster>BAIIIPLUS</original_poster>
    <original_post>What is the value of information for investors? The most valuable information to generate superior return is getting inside information. However, it is not usually available and you will be prosecuted if you trade on such information.

In addition to traditional media, brokers offer sell-side equity research. I don't think is is useful for retail investors to generate return above index.

1. Accuracy of recommendation  
 No one knows the future price. I don't see sufficient evidence to believe an analyst can accurately predict the future price. If he/she has such a predictive power, he/she should've quitted the job and made money by his/herself.
2. Knowledge  
 Some people may argue that we can accumulate knowledge reading sell-side equity research. However, could you generate superior return above index by knowing more? I don't think so because what you learned is already known by other rich investors who would have more significant influence on market prices.

Therefore, sell-side equity research is useless to retail investors to beat the market. They are marketing materials of brokers. To beat the market, there are more important factors than information from brokers such as investment experience and mental control.</original_post>

There is a few issues there.

* Just because they don't *know* the future price doesn't mean they can't be slightly better than the market at predicting it.  Even slightly better than market can make it worth listening to.
* Making a slightly better than market return doesn't necessarily mean you'll make more money doing that as your main job.  For example, Jim Cramer makes $5 million/year salary.  Even if his full estimated $100 million net worth was invested into stocks, he would have to beat the market by a full 5% in order to top what he gets paid as an analyst.  Even then it is still riskier and may just not be as enjoyable for him.
* Sell-side equity research influences the market, so even if it really was no better than throwing darts, its a factor that could influence the price so belongs in your research just like anything else that can influence company price.

Just because rich investors know what, say, Beta is doesn't mean it isn't worth learning and sell-side equity research is a place where you can learn about a lot of things like that.</text>
