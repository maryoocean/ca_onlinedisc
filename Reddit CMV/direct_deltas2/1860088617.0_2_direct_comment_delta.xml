    <title>CMV: We don't possess a rational mind only to sometimes think irrationally, and we don't evolve to get here only for some of us to feel complacent not to go any further at anything.</title>

    <original_post>I don't know, it just doesn't come to me that these faults of irrationality and not wanting to improve still exist within us all. The cause of basically all the world's issues, why we never get stuff done, the one thing holding us all back. What's more perplexing is the very attempt at fixing these "faults" is seen as something very detrimental. 

A case of tall poppy syndrome? Is this the limit of our improvement? Is there some sort of a kill switch preventing us from becoming uncontrolled? Is rationality in fact the undesirable byproduct of evolution? We're given opportunity to be awesome and the right ways to get there, and we just reject them? I just need to understand what I've been missing.</original_post>

    <text>That's not what evolution means. Evolution is just our way of describing the natural processes that get life forms to have kids and pass on their genes, and in that situation, a lack of ambition and a desire to not take undue risks are very helpful. After all, why bother 'going further' when you have enough food to last? Why bother risking things when it won't actually increase the chances of your children surviving to adulthood?

As for 'rationality', I dunno, I think that claiming that there's only one thing holding us back and causing all of the world's issues is very irrational to me.</text>
