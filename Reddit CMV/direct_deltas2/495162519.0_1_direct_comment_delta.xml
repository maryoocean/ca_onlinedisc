    <title>CMV: Euthanasia should be legal in all jurisdictions to be performed on humans.</title>
    <original_poster>SirenitoDelFrio</original_poster>
    <original_post>Euthanasia is the practice of painlessly killing someone due to terminal illness or extreme pain. If this is allowed to be performed on animals, then why are humans any different?

Since this is a messy political and ethical question, I’ll try to state my side of the problem only.

-

When a person is suffering, either do to cancer, life threatening injuries, a vegetative state, or any other factor that reduces their quality of life to nearly nothing, I whole heartedly believe that the execution of euthanasia should be allowed legally.

What joy from life does a person get if they are trapped in a hospital bed, with no chance of getting better? If they have no hope of living their life, then why should we continue to force their hearts to beat via machines? All the machines do is keep the heart beating, and drain the families bank accounts. They don’t keep the brain active, they don’t allow for communication. It’s simply a way for a hospital to earn money from a grieving family.

What is ethical about forcing someone to keep living, when they don’t receive the actual benefits of life? I just don’t see the moral responsibility of keeping someone alive when they receive no quality of life. I don’t get why someone should be kept alive if they have no chance of getting better.</original_post>

    <text>I agree with you in theory, but in practice I have issues with making it available on a large scale. One concern that I have is mistreatment of the elderly or terminally ill, especially those in nursing homes or on hospice. 

A lot of abuse has been uncovered in nursing homes, for example. And even when there isn't straight-up abuse, there's lots of apathy from overworked or low-paid caretakers. I wouldn't want them to be in a position where they could just make life miserable for more problematic or difficult clients until that client essentially realizes that euthanasia is the only way out.

I'm for euthanasia being available for those who are independent and who are dying or who have incurable chronic pain. But for the elderly who can be manipulated or forced? It gets a little murky.
