    <title>CMV: Twitter is nearly unreadable and people mostly only use it for posting</title>
    <original_poster>aurochs</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have tried many times to get into Twitter but I am always astounded by how visually unfriendly the experience is. 

Problems:

* There are so many out-of context sentences with people replying to each other but I can't see what they're replying to unless I click around for a while. Couldn't the replies be grouped with the original tweet without having to click on the name and then click 'details?'

* Some people are writing paragraphs spread out over multiple tweets so this leaves their rant broken up by unrelated tweets from other people. 

* I try to follow some comedians, but their tweets are usually something like "I'm in Chicago tonight, come my show. Now I'm in Minneapolis..."

* No categorization. Subjects are all over the place and common topics are not grouped together.

* Too many weird @symbols and #hashtags and http://links just creates a fatiguing reading experience.

I understand the reasons for all of these issues but they are all problems that have been solved by other platforms like reddit and Facebook. I can't understand why twitter is so popular despite all of these points. It could easily be so much better.

    <text>Twitter is for following lots of people shallowly, Facebook is for following less people more deeply, Reddit is for following *ideas* deeply.  It is incorrect to say that any one of those three solves the problem better - they all solve *different* problems.

Through the imposition of the short-form post Twitter allows me to quickly catch up, shallowly, on hundreds of people.  If I were to use Facebook I'd need to scroll through literally 10x as much content per person and thus, while seeing deeper, see fewer per any unit of time.

Most the problems you describe having with the Twitter experience come from not grokking the "Twitter language" yet.  As someone else said above me that comes with familiarity.  (PS.  Tap on the "out-of-context sentence" to see the thread, don't dig through the person's posts.)

EDIT:  and if you don't find the utility of Twitter high for any given person, unfollow them.  The whole point is to follow those people who "do it for you".  Life's too short to struggle with content, as tempting as it may be, which doesn't press your buttons.
