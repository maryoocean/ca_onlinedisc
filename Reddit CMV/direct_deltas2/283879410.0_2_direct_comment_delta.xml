    <title>CMV: 'Jump scares' are a cheap party trick, and movies that are full of them shouldn't be considered horror</title>

Lately I've noticed that most horror movies rely on jump scares. Something will unexpectedly pop out at the audience, a loud noise will startle everyone, you know the works. Sometimes the movie tries to trick people into believing that a certain scene will have a jump scare, to make the viewer feel safe, and then do a jump scare in the next scene.

I think that movies like Paranormal Activity, The Conjuring and The Darkness do not do their best to scare the audience in a creative way.

Jump scares do something physical to your body. Sometimes my mom jumps out at the me when I walk through the door, to elicit a scream or a 'fear' reaction from me. However, a second later I'm just laughing because it's silly and not at all scary.

When I go see a movie at the theater that has a lot of jump scares, most of the audience members just seem to be laughing. You may hear a collective gasp or a scream, but that's just a reflex. 

Most movies riddled with jump scares do not leave an impression on me. I find them annoying.

Jump scares do not tell a story that sends shivers down your spine and causes you to lay awake at night. Jump scares do not show you a gruesome scene that will be burned into your mind for the weeks to come.

Jump scares are cheap party tricks. They are annoying and do not elicit any feelings of terror. 

Change my view.

    <text>Horror stems from two primal instincts:

1. Realisation of danger.

1. Presentation of danger.

Lets work on number 1. A movie that starts out as a comedy, but gets less funny, and turns into a drama, and finally, it is revealed, after several incredibly dark scenes that it's been about a cannibal all along. An astute watcher would see the small signs that the makers left, and realise the danger to the characters. This tensions, that you know of the danger and they do not generates the horror.

The Silence of the Lambs did this incredibly effectively, showing that Hannibal is the most dangerous character, not Buffalo Bill.

Number two is different. There needs to be no long build up, rather you can simply show that "there is danger here". It can be a subtle reveal or a jump scare. Paranormal Activity is a brilliant example. You have a house, which is not a dangerous thing. Unlike an unknown prisoner, there is almost no way for the house to be dangerous.

Paranormal Activity uses the long sequences of little action to entrench this idea, then hits you with the jump scares, presenting that there is something that both the characters and the audience do not know, and it is dangerous.

Movies that rely on presentation of danger work best when the audience accepts that they only know as much as the characters, instead of having the privilege of being able to work out the danger before the characters encounter it.

Imagine waking up and realising you have been surrounded by lions all night.

Imagine a lion jumping out of a bush at you.

If you are any kind of rational person, both should scare you, and both can be elements in a horror movie.</text>
