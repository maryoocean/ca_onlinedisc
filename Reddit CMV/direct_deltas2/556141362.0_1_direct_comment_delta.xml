    <title>CMV: Fines should scale according to the person's wealth</title>
    <original_poster>onlyfoolandhorse</original_poster>
    <original_post>...or some other punishment should be included. The punishment should be worse depending on how much money people have.  


Fines are supposed to be a deterrent.  
For a deterrent to work the accused must want to avoid the penalty i.e. the fine.  
A billionaire hardly minds if he gets a Â£200 fine!

Notes:  
 \- Sometimes this wouldn't be possible, but when it is possible the extra admin would be well worth it.   
 \- Additional punishments could include some sort of public shaming, more driving licence points deducted, etc. I don't know, just anything which puts wealthier people off commiting crimes. It doesn't necessarily have to be money, although money makes sense as it could go towards helping victims of the crime (e.g. helping victims of speeding motorists).</original_post>

    <text>Doesn't this incent the wealthy to hire out for fall guys?


Suppose I wanted to commit insurance fraud. If the maximum penalty for me getting caught is $10,000 but for my next door neighbor it's $1,000, why wouldn't I just hedge my risk, pay him to commit the fraud and if we get caught I'm only out $1,000 when I stood to gain $5,000 to $7,000?


Same thing for businesses. I see a lot of opportunities for the law to be abused here.

What if I structure my employee so he has no traceable wealth, and then have him act unethically/illegally on my behalf. He gets paid handsomely and he gets fined nothing. I'm heavily incentivized  to break the law with proxies.</text>
