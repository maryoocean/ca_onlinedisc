    <title>CMV: Not all cops are bad people and people who believe ACAB suffer from black and white thinking</title>
    <original_poster>youngsurpriseperson</original_poster>
    <original_post>I get it, police brutality is a thing and there is plenty of video evidence of it. Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested. And racist cops are obviously bad too.

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of "to protect and serve" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this.</original_post>

    <text>Police brutality and racism and abuse are problems, but they're not *the* problem.

The problem is that there's no accountability for their actions, largely because their fellow police (alongside things like district attorneys) always protect their own. They backup, lie, and file false reports to protect these abuses because that Thin Blue Line must be maintained. Stomping on people's heads gets called standard procedure, lying on reports gets ignored, and harassing innocent civilians gets you a paid vacation or some paperwork.

ACAB is a recognition that the system of police is inherently corrupt such that no "good" cop can ever actually be good. And, as such, the good cops either stop being good or stop being cops.</text>
