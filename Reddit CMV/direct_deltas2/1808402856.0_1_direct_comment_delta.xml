    <title>CMV: Fredom of speech is far more important than a few people being offended</title>

    <original_post>Freedom of speech should be protected and kept, there shouldn't be people arrested for anti trans comments or insulting a soldier/soldiers, or for nazi jokes, or racist remarks or jokes.

Those should all be handled between people, if someone says stuff you dont like you handle it, simply block them or avoid them, theres a whole world you can be in and that persons in a very tiny part of it. 

It makes me nervous seeing people arrested and charged for saying things. It's only leading us to a place where we can be arrested for saying whatever the government doesnt like. And they shouldn't be in that much power to effect our communication with eachother. 

I live in scotland and dont feel I have freedom of speech anymore. 

(For the record I'm a white woman who's bi and have trans thoughts ig for those folks who say it never has been about me, it has sometimes, and in more ways than just those)

Edit: No it's not just anti trans people, Yes I believe crimes other than hate crimes involving speech should be illegal (threatening violence, doxing, defamation) but I also believe insults, jokes and bad takes or thoughts should not be.

Edit 2: Consequences for what is said like losing a job, getting insulted, losing friends ect is totally fine I just dont think the Government should be in charge of what can get you arrested in this sence.

Edit 3: I live in SCOTLAND in the UNITED KINGDOM or in BRITAIN depending what you say, I'm not american, im also not here advocating for my right to be a dick, im just saying the government arent the ones I want saying what I cant say, I mean twitter can destroy lives without them anyway.</original_post>

    <text>You understand freedom of speech cannot erode the rights of others, right? You can say whatever you want but you are legally and constitutionally limited because you do not occupy society alone. You live amongst others who navigate the world differently than you due to cultural difference, age difference, gender difference and race difference. 

Therefore, you are all in your right exercise that freedom but do not NOT expect consequences for that said right being expressed. Similarly, if you say something and it constitutes as defamation, it is only fair you face the consequences of that said thing because you eroded on the rights of someone else. Perhaps you infringed on their right to privacy.

Also in terms of your examples, again, exercise your right. But if someone thinks what you said alluded to a threat, hate speech or discrimination, they are entitled to see to you exercising your right as they deem fit. Therefore, if they get the law involved, and the law also supports their claim with the rules pertaining to the law, you cannot be angry because you choosing to exercise your freedom of speech had consequences.</text>
