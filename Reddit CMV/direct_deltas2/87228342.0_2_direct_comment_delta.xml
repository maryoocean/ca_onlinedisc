    <title>True privacy has always been imagined. Our only concern should be right to due process; everyting else is a distraction. CMV</title>

    <original_post>Most of us aren't as sneaky as we think. So, our concept of "privacy" has always been more of a feigned ignorance by our peers, dependents, and authority figures. Restated, it is more likely than not, that in the chaos of our lives, we've let slip each of our dirty little secrets at one point or another. Therefore, perceived violations of privacy are a violation of our imagination.

The judiciary has been tasked with declaring what facts can be brought in support of our guilt or innocence. So, our primary concern should not be keeping secrets but rather, ensuring our right to a fair trial. Outrage over privacy violations feels good but it serves nothing.

Please change my view.</original_post>

    <text>Perfect privacy may not be possible, as you say, but feigned ignorance is also useful. Feigned ignorance means that a breach of privacy might not spread--it will happen, but in isolated events, usually to people who are close to you and have a personal stake in maintaining your privacy. Also, those breaches of privacy rarely produce material evidence of the secret--knowledge of the secret is all there is. By putting material evidence in the hands of people with no personal stakes in the well-being of the person whose secret that is, the risk of abuse increases exponentially, far beyond what insisting on due process can rectify.</text>
