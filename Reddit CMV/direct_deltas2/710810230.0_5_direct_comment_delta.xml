    <title>CMV: High school literature and history courses fail to provide meaningful educational value</title>
    <original_poster>dabears_24</original_poster>
    <original_post>In their current form, high school courses focused on history and literature fail to provide meaningful educational benefits. 

These classes commonly have a goal of improving critical thinking skills and develop advanced literacy. However, the format of current history courses where students heavily analyze past events, does not emphasize critical thinking, but rather focuses on memorization of history that has little to no significance in the present. Literature classes that focus on deep analysis of *important* texts like Shakespeare's works, complex poetry, or stylistic writing (i.e. stream-of-consciousness in "Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man") do not develop readinc/writing skills applicable to students' lives or modern texts. They also tend to foster dislike for reading when students are forced to extract meaning from texts they do not value or understand.

I believe a courses in debate, critical analysis of nonfiction works (i.e. argumentative opinion pieces), or even literary analysis of more familiar works would all be better alternatives to detailed US history or general literature courses.

Since this is a broad statement with caveats, I'll clarify in a list:

- I am not arguing the classes offer zero value. The concept of being in an educational environment likely has benefits itself, so my view will not be changed by arguments of the form "all education has value".


- I acknowledge the value of basic history lessons in understand society, culture, and history that affects us today. I am arguing that there is little to no value in all students having to learn of details like specific battles of the Civil War, or the politics of the early 1800s. These topics should be pursed electively.


- I am not arguing that these classes lack value only because they do not tie to future careers. I believe these two courses majorly fail to provide value. I agree that math and science courses do not necessarily tie into future work, but I believe they accomplish their goals more effectively.

I admit I may display a STEM-favoring bias due to my field of study and work, so I am willing to accept arguments that show that my view is a function solely of my bias and not of reason.

EDIT: Want to clarify that I still think history should be taught at a general level in school. I don't think it should be as detailed or exhaustive as a part of the core curriculum. In other words, I think the necessary history can be taught in fewer total classes

EDIT 2: Pretty late in the cycle now, but I'll add this regardless since I've engaged with a lot of arguments that misinterpret my post. I am not arguing against the value of History and Literature. I am saying these classes are ineffective in their current forms</original_post>

    <text>I think that this argument is a really weak one because at a base level there is really little to disagree with. Your premise is basically that bad curriculums are bad. Any quality teacher would agree that just rote memorization of facts and reading literature without real analysis doesn't teach much.

So what I'll say to try and change your view is that your view rather than taking on the classes should be taking on the education system as a whole. Our education system is largely still structured around farmers' kids learning during the off season to give them something to do. It's not individual and it's not really preparing people for anything. It's not the classes fault, it's the states that have testing on rote memorization rather than analysis or critical thinking.

A US History course can have plenty of important things to learn. Why did the country turn against alcohol enough to make an amendment to ban it then change their minds? In what ways did slavery get perpetuated even after it was "outlawed." What set of circumstances REALLY led to the US joining WWI and WWII beyond just single events. What did those single events spark?

A general literature course can teach you plenty too. You called out Shakespeare as not helpful to learn. But what is the implication of gender in Twelfth Night? Who is meant to be the antagonist in Merchant of Venice? What's the difference between the idealization of love and the reality of love in Romeo and Juliet?

You get my point. There's nothing wrong with these courses, but teachers have to make sure their students follow the curriculums as given. Take it up with the system not the teachers and their classes.</text>
