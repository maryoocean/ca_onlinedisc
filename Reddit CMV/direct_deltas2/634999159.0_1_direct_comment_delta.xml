    <title>CMV: There is no position on either side of the US immigration policy debate that makes any damn sense.</title>

    <original_post>Sure, the extremists in most debates don’t make sense, that’s normal. In this case, extreme conservatives want mass deportations of all illegal aliens, and extreme liberals want wide open borders where all are welcomed without limit. Either extreme seems clear it would be a disaster.

But what would a reasonable moderate (or slightly liberal) position be? I can’t think of one! Here’s how I currently interpret our balance:

* yes, we need at least some border security, we can’t just let people slip past the border checkpoints whenever they want.

* however, if you do successfully sneak past our border security, congratulations, you made it! We don’t like to deport people once they start setting down roots, so welcome aboard!

* therefore, we should have moderate border security that stops some people, but we will sort of look the other way sometimes too.

Letting people stay based on how successfully and for how long they evade the law seems like nonsense to me, but I can’t think of a better way. Is there one?</original_post>

Overwhelming majority of illegal immigrants are visa overstays.  People who entered legally and didn't leave when they were supposed to.

Have you looked at the bipartisan bill that passed the Senate 68-32 that the House refused to take up in 2013?  Might be a good starting place.  </text>
