    <title>CMV: r/childfree is a toxic sub</title>
    <original_poster>SosRashneer</original_poster>
    <original_post>childfree is toxic. The sub isn't about being childfree, its about hating children as a whole. When I see a post on childfree its always about someone hating on other peoples "Crotch goblins" or "little brats". Like sometimes the child will be doing nothing at all and they're like "ugh I hate the little fucker so much like keep your crotch goblins inside your own house."
And I never really see any thoughtful discussions going on there I always only see someone hating on some other peoples children. And when someone tries to defend the child they usually get banned or downvoted. And I understand the reasoning of a child being expensive as to not having one, but if you're complaining that they're selfish that's the parents job to fix, and annoying, that can also be fixed by the parent.</original_post>

    <text>Posts like that are a minority, I’d say. It’s otherwise a really good resource for people who don’t want kids and are looking for other people who share their (very uncommon) mindset. If there are toxic posts, it’s because they’re not able to express frustration towards kids anywhere else, as society frowns upon that. Also, though it may seem directed towards the kids, most complaints are actually (whether explicitly or not) because of the parents. A lot of people there don’t hate kids, they just hate how some of them are raised with no manners.</text>
