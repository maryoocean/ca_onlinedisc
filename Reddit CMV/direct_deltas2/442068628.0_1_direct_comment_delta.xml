    <title>CMV: The American political enviroment is hopeless.</title>
    <original_poster>BassFight</original_poster>
    <original_post>I feel like the above could increasingly also be said about Dutch politics, but I expect more people can talk about America. 

Basically, at the writing of this post I have a very pessimistic outlook on the future of the democracy, in part due to ongoing discussions that need not be discussuon, including climate change, net neutrality, and whether person with different skin, organs or partners are less human, and in part due to the extremely toxic nature of discord that surrounds these topics and others. Apperant corruption on various sides does not help. 
Regarding political issues, be it immigration policies, taxes or care, I have allways found that the answer is not found by leaning extremely to either right or left and yelling at everyone on the other side. I think 'us vs them' thinking is one of the greatest challenges humans are facing, but I used to believe we can get past it by allowing both sides voices because most humans do what they think is right for the people around them. I still believe the last bit, but I have lost hope that people are able to have a civiliced discussion. I have seen attempts at peaceful mediating responded to with hateful negativity. I am no longer concinced enough people are willing to see other's perspectives and come to a shared conclusion or worldview.

To be clear: I am not looking to discuss the aforementioned discussions. I am specifically looking for arguments that there is still hope that humans can come together, admit to our own and point to other's faults and talk our stuff out effectively and in a way that makes most people happy. I am hoping these will cheer me up as well as change my perspective and maybe other's for the better. Give me hope!! 

For this discussion I have assumed hate is not the answer, as it usually breeds moee hate.


Tl;dr- convince me of the ability of humans to get together and talk about their problems in a healthy and peaceful way without responding to any individual or group with hate. 

EDIT: This got more responses and I have less time than anticipated. I will do my best to read and respond to all comments in the coming day(s) and deal out deltas where deserved. Thanks and sorry for the poor OP-ing!</original_post>

    <text>For me, history is a source of hope.

In the 1960's segregation was so widespread, white people didn't even want to drink out of the same water fountains as black people. Think of how crazy and divided that is! This isn't some ancient past, this is the world that current middle aged people were born into.

Barack Obama was born in 1961 into a world where racism was baked into law and custom. He was born just one year after Ruby Bridges and her family were threatened with death daily for simply wanting their daughter to go to a school that was previously all white. He was born six years after Emmet Till was lynched at 14 years old. He was born six years before the Supreme Court Struck down interracial marriage in Loving v. Virginia.

Imagine the hopelessness of being born into a country where the majority of the population don't even want to use the same water fountain as you. Where they think you shouldn't go to the same school as them, so passionately that they threaten death. Where the marriage of your parents would be illegal in many states. Imagine transcending THAT hopelessness to become the most powerful individual in the country.

It can be tempting in the aftermath to view progress as inevitable. But the distance that society traveled between the birth of Barack Obama and his inauguration as president in just 48 years is at least a testament to our country's vast capacity for change. </text>
