    <title>CMV: I consider the Nordic model the best socio-economic model to base a country around &amp;amp; the best compromise between the right and left</title>

I believe the free market combined with a social safety net reduces poverty which benefits everyone. High level of education, highly efficient administration effectively invests into the society, providing multiple incentives and angles of growth.  

People have trust in their government, in their administration and how their taxes are used. This leads to a high level of security; problems are laid off them and ultimately this leads to a high level of happiness.   

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report  

Low level of income inequality, high GDP and PPP per capita, liberal laws, low crime, low corruption, good healthcare, great education, low pollution. What's not to like?  

But all this does not obstruct high profit businesses from investing and all that is asked from businesses is that they treat their employees with respect and pay them enough so they can make a decent living. True, most thrift-based businesses would be discouraged from investing but Imo in the developed country there should be no place for such an exploiting business style.  

My only doubt is whether such a model could adapt to a larger country because in all Nordic cases we deal with low populations, large areas and often, decent levels of natural resources and admittedly this does create conditions for easier administration and sustainable economic growth.  

CMV, thanks in advance!

It's tempting to want to agree with you, for the simple reason that we do indeed come out on top in most measurements of happiness, wealth, and a number of other statistics.

There are some frequently cited drawbacks, however:

1. The "Jante Law" culture, which is a variant of the "Tall Poppy Syndrome", where excellence is actively discouraged.

2. The sometimes excessive xenophobia, indicating that the model largely works because of a high level of trust between citizens, and between citizens and the state. The introduction of foreign elements, where trust isn't an integral part of the culture, could theoretically sabotage the efficacy of the model.

3. The "Low Expectations" critique â€” maybe we're so damn happy because we don't expect much of life, and therefore real outcomes tend to match or exceed our expectations. Maybe our culture would create "happiness" under different circumstances as well, indicating that the model itself isn't what's creating these statistics, but rather some other factor, like culture or even genetics (as suggested by some admittedly fringe theories).

4. The wealth of Scandinavian countries is also the result of the same mechanisms that have created wealth in the rest of Europe, including most prominently exploitative colonialism. While Scandinavian countries were only minor colonial powers (most notably Denmark), they all benefited massively from trade with stronger colonial powers, like The Netherlands, United Kingdom, France, and to an extent Germany. The Nordic Model may have served to develop and distribute this wealth in a desirably way, but hasn't necessarily created the wealth in the first place.

I don't particularly agree with all these criticisms, but they're worth considering.

One relevant question, though: Do you think the Nordic Model is *the best possible system* or just *the best we have at the moment*? I think any Swede, Dane and Norwegian would say that they can point to flaws in our individual systems. Someone is always going to be at least a little bit dissatisfied, but allowing yourself to think that "this is the best we can do" is harmful, because our societies *do* have real problems as well, even if they're slightly smaller problems than some other nations face.

One specific problem that I'm familiar with, because I'm Danish, is the fact that Danish societal coherence is largely based on *ethnic* and *cultural* homogeneity. This means that even if Denmark is doing great in the globalised economy, it is facing a massive *cultural* struggle, because there is no concept of Danish national identity that doesn't prescribe a very specific ethnic and cultural background. In a globalised world of many ethnicities, this becomes a real problem that manifests itself both in very high levels of xenophobia, but also in perpetual cultural insecurity, which makes it difficult to interact with people from other backgrounds. This is how the idiom of the "duck pond" (*andedam*) in Danish has emerged, as a metaphor not just for the country itself but for the slightly self-obsessed and self-important mentality of the Danes.

Compare this with American national identity, which is to a large degree grounded in the Constitution of the United States of America, its rights, freedoms, and institutions, rather than any specific ethnicity or culture [although obviously a distinct American culture has emerged over the last century]. This isn't to downplay racial issues in America, but the point is that Danish minority identities aren't even hyphenated. It's "The Danes" and "The Muslims", not "The Danish Muslims".</text>
