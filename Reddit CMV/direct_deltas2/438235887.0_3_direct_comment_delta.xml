    <title>CMV: If gender is a social construct, then so is race</title>
    <original_poster>BoppeBoye</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let us take, as a given, that gender is divorced from the circumstances of your birth, that it is not a mental illness, and that there is no biological basis for what gender identity someone should express. Have I phrased that effectively? I'm trying to be concise, but I want to portray that premise correctly.

Why, then, should race be different than gender? If race carries with it "shared experience" and "lived experience", etc - that assumes that the only way you could understand what it's like to be a minority is to have lived your entire life as that particular minority. I'm not arguing against that, I agree that there are certain experiences that I could not comprehend - for instance, overbearing &amp;amp; strict Asian parents with exceedingly high expectations. 

But, if someone can change their gender or decide (?) that they identify as a different gender without having the prior lived experience of said gender, then why can't someone identify as a different race?

I'm not able to encompass all the variables which could lead someone to identify as another gender, but is it not possible for someone to come to the same conclusion with their race? What if an Indian man grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood, saw or experienced the same (or similar) discrimination as them, had minimal exposure to Indian culture; and this led him to conclude that he identifies more closely as a black man, rather than Indian? 

I would also like to cite Rachel Dolezal, who was uniformly mocked for being (afaik) the first trans-black woman in the public eye. It seems similar to transgender discrimination to me, assuming that there is something wrong with her mentally for deciding to become a black woman... Anyway, I'm not really defending her because that's not really in line with what I described in the previous paragraph (she grew up privileged IIRC), but the public reaction of mockery goes against the leftist belief of acceptance, by my perspective.

So, in short, why can there be no such thing as trans-racial people, the same way there are transgender?

    <text>The problem here is that people like to make things too simplistic, often creating artificial barriers that are mutually exclusive. Social constructionism is one of these areas. So is race.

Gender is not really a social construct. Yes, there are *elements* of gender that are social constructs, but it a complicated topic. Let's start with what it isn't. I keep seeing this meme about "sex" being biological and "gender" being psychological and social, as if those things are mutually exclusive. People confuse "biological", "physiological", and confuse "genetic" and "unchangeable", and confuse "psychological" and "social construct". Both your physiology and psychology are largely biological, are mostly genetic, and much of society and culture is an emergent property of our biological tendencies. And our biology, psychology, personalities, and behaviours include portions that are from the environment around us, even moment by moment, and that environment includes social environment, which is in large part fed by our biological tendencies. To try to decouple these as being independent is madness, and "social construct" does not mean "arbitrary" or "infinitely maleable".

Let's take a specific example: women wearing lipstick. Clearly we have no genes for lipstick. Clearly lipstick is a social construct. It didn't come from nature and we didn't evolve with it, right? Sure. Yes. But if we removed all traces of lipstick, of ever wearing lipstick, eliminated it from our memories, and started societies over from an amnesiatic state, we'd reinvent lipstick, it would be women wearing it, and it would tend to be shades of red.

Why? Because of *why* we invented lipstick in the first place. It's because red lipstick on women's lips triggers an innate response in men that women want. Why? Because male mammals (especially primates) evolved an attraction and arousal response to seeing engorged red lips on females and we human males still have that instinctual response. OK, it's the wrong lips, but our arousal mechanism isn't a cognitive decision. It is a simple trigger.

It's like chocolate cake. We didn't evolve with cake. We invented it (a social construct) because it fed an innate response that we did evolve for sweet tastes, because high sugar/calories were rare and valuable in nature. When quick and easy calories were scarce for us, it improved our survivability and reproductive success. In an era where we have an abundance of quick and easy calories, that same innate response is bad for our health. We don't *decide* to want to eat it; it just tastes really good to do us and most people have cravings for high sugar foods (i.e., a "sweet tooth").

Lipstick feeds a similar desire. Men innately respond to women with red, pouty lips. Women innately (statistically) want to attract men as mates/partners and so do the things that attract them. Some of this is also innate (via sexual selection), and some of it is pattern recognition of what works (memetic/cultural evolution).

Women don't have the same innate attraction triggers. They don't tend to be aroused by red, engorged lips on men because males don't have body parts that this would arouse. This is why a new society would tend to re-invent lipstick, why women would wear it, and why it would tend to be shades of red.

(There are plenty of exceptions, but they aren't *statistically* significant and tend to come from other properties of humans. E.g., women wearing other shades like blue or dark black are exhibiting counter-culture and most men would not see them as attractive as wearing red lipstick. Some men wear lipstick in some rituals or activities, but again it's not regular, not the same cause, and not statistically significant in comparison. Also, it's not necessarily just red, but body tone shades that appear like blood has engorged the lips, which can vary by skin tone. 

Now, everything I just described about lipstick could be factually incorrect. I have no intention of presenting a scientific case for as this isn't a post about lipstick. Rather, I've used this case as an example of how genes, biology, psychology, and social behaviour interact with each other.

Wearing red lipstick very much a part of the female gender behaviour. It is a social *behaviour* that is rooted in our biology, rooted in sexual selection between males and females, and is a stable behaviour. It is associated with a female biological sex, corresponding to having vaginal lips, and corresponding to males being attracted to it. Just because there are a subset of exceptions to this does not change that because genes aren't like programs that dictate an exact response; they are more like subroutines that interact with other subroutines that are aggregated, usually aligned with each other, but not always for a variety of reasons.

Race is different. Biologically speaking, race comes from groups of humans that evolved in separate geographic locations for long enough to show some physical (and possibly psychological) differences. 

A "perfect" division of people into races could hypothetically happen if they all only reproduced within the same isolated groups for long enough. If you were to plot the statistical distribution of their features it would look like a series of mountain peaks with valleys below -- all of one race in one distribution associated with the geographic location and ancestry -- and few individuals or none with features between two "races". (The "valley" between the peaks.)

It isn't necessary for them to be completely isolate though, as long as the gene flow was a small enough percentage of the group they would still evolve statistical differences. The more they interbred, the more those peaks would become lower, the width of the distribution "hill" would widen, and those valleys would raise, creating "undulating hills" of distributions of traits.

Since global travel started growing, we see more and more of that, but we do still see a lot of homoegenous regions and subcultures in multicultural societies that mate only with others of their same "kind". That keeps the hills from flattening out completely, but they will tend toward continual erosion into one large, flat, mixed race eventually.

None of that is social construction so far.

We also have genetic tendencies though. One is ingroup/outgroup tribalism. We don't have genes for racism, nationalism, or similar group separations; what we have is a genetic tendency toward identifying which "tribe" we belong to and who belongs to other "tribes". We do this for mathematical reasons of our history. There is safety and value in numbers vs being a lone individual, particularly in certain environments as far as food, mating, and predators. In times of scarcity, if there are too many people fighting over too little resources, there's value in ganging up -- two people taking the food of one person and splitting it is better than both going hungry. But only to a point. Too big a group means fighting again for the resources. There is a maximum size for the group based on available resources. That leaves some people as rejected out of the group. Their best interests are to form another group to fight back against those taking things from them. Gang war, basically. Chimpanzees do this, as do humans.

You can trigger ingroup/outgroup tribalist behaviour very easily by identifying people into groups and putting those groups in conflict, e.g., using eye colour from [Jane Elliott's classroom experiment](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201012/in-groups-out-groups-and-the-psychology-crowds), random assignment to groups as in the [Robbers Cave Experiment](https://www.simplypsychology.org/robbers-cave.html), or any random thing: favorite sports team, city, country, language, political leanings, Android vs iOS, Coke vs Pepsi, etc. This has been repeated thousands of times and is well modeled, such as by [Realistic Conflict Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realistic_conflict_theory). You see it triggered all the time with even simple insults like "black criminality" or "white privilege", which includes both tribe identifiers (skin colour) and a conflict between groups by throwing insults aimed at all people of that skin colour. That creates hatred immediately out of nowhere.

What does that have to do with race? Well, physical features are an obvious grouping that people can easily define "tribes" based on, combined with familiarity and relatedness, so people tend to congregate more, and live around, people of their own race. That's why you get "Little Italy" and "Chinatown" areas of cities. 

And, *culture* tends to be of similar nature of geographic location. Ergo there is a tight correlation between race, ethnicity, and culture. But there is no particular reason for them to go hand in hand. An Asian child brought up in a mostly black neighbourhood will tend toward the local culture, and vice versa. Culture is what we grow up around, not about race or ethnicity. There is no "white culture" or "black culture" or "Asian culture". There is, however, culture from regions and neighbourhoods that tend to be statistically more one race than another because of our groupish tendencies, not inherently due to race.

So these are different causes, and different from gender. Most of it is biological but huge social factors that combine a bunch of our innate tendencies, and the creation of correlations that we tend to recognize as patterns and associate together. So sometimes people mean physical features when they say "race", and sometimes they mean cultural features, the latter being correlative and less accurate. The former is not a social construct per se, the latter sort of is. And, the boundaries between races are fuzzy and getting fuzzier.

These are complex topics that too many people try to oversimplify.
