    <title>CMV: High school literature and history courses fail to provide meaningful educational value</title>
    <original_poster>dabears_24</original_poster>
    <original_post>In their current form, high school courses focused on history and literature fail to provide meaningful educational benefits. 

These classes commonly have a goal of improving critical thinking skills and develop advanced literacy. However, the format of current history courses where students heavily analyze past events, does not emphasize critical thinking, but rather focuses on memorization of history that has little to no significance in the present. Literature classes that focus on deep analysis of *important* texts like Shakespeare's works, complex poetry, or stylistic writing (i.e. stream-of-consciousness in "Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man") do not develop readinc/writing skills applicable to students' lives or modern texts. They also tend to foster dislike for reading when students are forced to extract meaning from texts they do not value or understand.

I believe a courses in debate, critical analysis of nonfiction works (i.e. argumentative opinion pieces), or even literary analysis of more familiar works would all be better alternatives to detailed US history or general literature courses.

Since this is a broad statement with caveats, I'll clarify in a list:

- I am not arguing the classes offer zero value. The concept of being in an educational environment likely has benefits itself, so my view will not be changed by arguments of the form "all education has value".


- I acknowledge the value of basic history lessons in understand society, culture, and history that affects us today. I am arguing that there is little to no value in all students having to learn of details like specific battles of the Civil War, or the politics of the early 1800s. These topics should be pursed electively.


- I am not arguing that these classes lack value only because they do not tie to future careers. I believe these two courses majorly fail to provide value. I agree that math and science courses do not necessarily tie into future work, but I believe they accomplish their goals more effectively.

I admit I may display a STEM-favoring bias due to my field of study and work, so I am willing to accept arguments that show that my view is a function solely of my bias and not of reason.

EDIT: Want to clarify that I still think history should be taught at a general level in school. I don't think it should be as detailed or exhaustive as a part of the core curriculum. In other words, I think the necessary history can be taught in fewer total classes

EDIT 2: Pretty late in the cycle now, but I'll add this regardless since I've engaged with a lot of arguments that misinterpret my post. I am not arguing against the value of History and Literature. I am saying these classes are ineffective in their current forms</original_post>

    <text>It is a common mistake to assume that in school you only learn some facts. Mostly you are learning methods and cognitive skills.

* in math, you are learning to develop logical problem-solving by means of symbolic representation
* in the sciences, you learn how to get and understand data and how to interpret what lies behind what your senses are telling you
* in the humanities, you learn how communication and texts work, both written and oral.

Take your own post, for example. You have clearly set out a goal and identified a problem, defined some caveats and criteria. Your text is clear, well structured and intelligible. You write about an abstract topic with an appropriately abstract vocabulary. You also display some awareness about your own fallible judgment, otherwise you wouldn't post here in the first place - you are aware that there is a 'space of reasons', a broad spectrum of opinions, arguments and reasons in which you have situated yourself.

A ten year old kid could not have written a text like that. A person that never went to school would usually not be able to write a text like this. *Somewhere* down the road you have acquired the cognitive and intellectual skills required to make such an argument. I do not know anything about your upbringing, but usually people learn this in school. Usually not in the science classes, although they might figure in somewhere as well to a smaller degree. You learn to write such a complicated and abstract text in your literature and history classes. Even though you (and I) do not understand the details of the process at stake, going through all your humanity classes has *somehow* given you these cognitive abilities that ten-year old you did not yet have.

Do you *need* literature and history? Probably not; you could probably acquire the same skills through, say, politics, social studies, philosophy, learning latin, etc. Anywhere you comprehensively deal with texts and communication in a broader sense.

So there are further, additional benefits to be gained from each humanity. Let me briefly check the advantages of learning about literature. You can probably fill in the gaps for history by yourself.

By learning about literature you also learn something about the topics of literature. The big advantage of literature over the other arts is that it can deal with the inner perspective of someone, their experience, their thoughts and feelings, their values, etc., while other arts (movies, opera, paintings etc.) are more constraint to the outer perspective, which captures only actions and appearances. (The other arts sometimes mix in some techniques of literature to deal with this problem, but that is a different topic.)

By learning something about literature, you develop *a mental map of culture* that allows you to navigate through the nexus of human history, society, morality, and the problems of 'heart and soul', if you will call them that. Shakespeare and Joyce are great examples. No matter how boring that might have been to you, you still get an impression of *what it is like to be someone* *else* at another time. Their problems might not be your problems, but by understanding that difference you also learn something about yourself, since you are better able to situate yourself in a broader context. By learning about these selected texts, even if you do not enjoy reading them, you construct a mental map that still allows you to navigate our current culture better than someone who is not acquainted with it or who simply hasn't gone to school. There are many aspects to this, for example which discourses you (can) perceive or participate in, how much empathy you have for someone who is in different shoes, how you evaluate and organize your own value system.

Is this what I wrote above all just fancypants artsy-fartsy bullshit that has no measure, no application or method of being verifiable? Let me tell you this: When in the 1920s in Germany the Nazis came to power, it mostly wasn't the STEM-people who saw what was coming or who spoke out against the Nazis. It was rather the writers, the historians, the theologians, the journalists etc. who were able to read the signs of the time and who spoke out against Hitler. The engineers and the scientists, they went along with Hitler, to a much higher degree at least than the people with a background in the humanities.</text>
