    <title>CMV: "Retard" is not an offensive or ableist word because the connotation has changed from referring to mentally handicapped people to referring to stupid people, much like how the meaning of other words like "dumb" and "lame" have also changed meanings dramatically.</title>

    <original_post>So a lot of people find the word "Retard" used as an insult to be incredibly offensive, akin to saying the n-word to a black person. They say that this is because historically the word means mentally handicapped person and it was used in a patronizing and derogatory way during a time when there was a massive cultural stigma and disgust with mental disabilities. 

Yet, many words over the course of history change. Hell, a lot of the words we use today to refer to someone as an idiot - including the word idiot - were historically used to describe mentally ill/handicapped people. 

To this day, words like Imbecile, Moron and Cretin are used to describe stupid people (or troublemakers, in the case of cretin), yet these words actually mean the exact same thing as "retard". 

So why is retard singled out as "ableist"? Are people who take offence to the word simply being resistant to the natural evolution of language, or does their anger have merit? 

EDIT: Everyone made very good points. I'm considering them, but based on the fact that for the most part I had *nothing* to fire back with, I'd say my views have been thoroughly changed and I'm going to phase this word out of my vocabulary. I'm guilty of frequent use - it's easy to just turn to a buddy and say that in good fun without even thinking, but I'll be mindful in the future. 

Thanks people. Also You get a delta, you get a delta, and you get a delta, everyone gets a delta!!!!!

    <text>Is the word "retard" still regularly used to refer to the mentally handicapped? If you called a mentally handicapped person "retarded" would they (or anyone else around) know exactly what that means? 

The answer to both of those questions would seem to be "Yes." The force and power of the word "retard" as an insult still demonstrably derives from a force of comparison to the mentally handicapped - *everyone* knows what you mean when you use "retard" to mean stupid; there is no confusion here, and the original meaning of the world has not been lost, as is the case with "idiot" or even arguably "lame."

Using "retarded" to mean "stupid" is akin to using "gay" to mean bad or "Jewish" to mean cheap; the only reason we even know what someone means when they say these things is because of a comparison it makes to a marginalized group.</text>
