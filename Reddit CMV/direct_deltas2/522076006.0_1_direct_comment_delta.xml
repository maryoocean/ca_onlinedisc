    <title>CMV: Parrots don't make good pets.</title>
    <original_poster>KnightWhoSaysNi1</original_poster>
    <original_post>Just to be clear, I'm not in a place in my life to get a parrot, nor do I want one, as you can tell from the title of my post. But I want to find out why people find them to be good pets.

Here's why I don't think they make good pets:

1. From what I've read about them, they're on the emotional level of toddlers. And while human children are toddlers for a few years, parrots can live around eighty years. So you're dealing with a toddler for eighty years.

2. To add onto the previous point, they can live eighty to ninety effing years! Cats and dogs can live around twenty years, and that's a reasonable time commitment, but for a pet with the kind of lifespan that a parrot has, even if they have the very best outcome and have an owner who makes a lifelong commitment to them, there's still a good chance that they'll be uprooted from their home at the very end of their life.

3. From everything I hear and read, they require a ton of work! They seem to be messier and more expensive to take care of than dogs and cats, and after all that work, you can't cuddle them like dogs and cats. It also seems like it's hard to find a vet for them, and I'm guessing it would be way more expensive once you do find a vet.

4. They're loud and neurotic. If you don't devote a huge amount of attention to them, they screech all the time, pluck their feathers out, and attack people. I've heard a cockatoo screech, and I think I'd go insane if I had to listen to that sound in my house constantly.

With all this out of the way, I'm not going to pretend that I don't think that they're cool animals. They're really beautiful and seem pretty intelligent. It's neat that they can talk, and maybe for people who are not me, the novelty of them talking wouldn't wear off after ten minutes. I just think they'd be better off at zoos or wildlife sanctuaries where they have enough space to fly around and have a team of dedicated people than as pets in people's homes. Change my view!

They are roughly as smart as a toddlers when it comes to problem solving, they are not emotionally toddlers.

&amp;gt;To add onto the previous point, they can live eighty to ninety effing years! Cats and dogs can live around twenty years, and that's a reasonable time commitment, but for a pet with the kind of lifespan that a parrot has, even if they have the very best outcome and have an owner who makes a lifelong commitment to them, there's still a good chance that they'll be uprooted from their home at the very end of their life.

Isn't that a good thing? No one like sing their pet die. I don't think anyone with a dog has ever said "I'm so happy he is going to die soon, if my dog lived longer it would be so annoying". 

&amp;gt;From everything I hear and read, they require a ton of work! They seem to be messier and more expensive to take care of than dogs and cats, and after all that work, you can't cuddle them like dogs and cats. It also seems like it's hard to find a vet for them, and I'm guessing it would be way more expensive once you do find a vet.

Its not that much work, you don't have to take them on walks. Also plenty of them do cuddle, but it varies bird to bird, like cats. 

&amp;gt;They're loud and neurotic. If you don't devote a huge amount of attention to them, they screech all the time and pluck all their feathers out. I've heard a cockatoo screech, and I think I'd go insane if I had to listen to that sound in my house constantly.

Again, it varies bit to bird. They make noise to get attention, if you talk to them regularly they won't bother making a fuss.</text>
