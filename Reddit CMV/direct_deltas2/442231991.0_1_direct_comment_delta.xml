    <title>CMV: Christianity is held together through fear</title>
    <original_poster>M1STER_B0NES</original_poster>
    <original_post>My opinion is that if the fear of going to Hell was not present in the Christian ideology, then most of the followers of the religion would not be there.

Before I decided I was agnostic, that was my only reason for continuing to identify with the religion. Then, I decided I wasn't going to let fear control me. 

All in all, I don't see how this is any different than blackmailing a person to do what you want. You present your instruction, then tell them how you will completely devastate their life if they do not follow through.</original_post>

    <text>I’m atheist, so I won’t be able to get you a view from a theist but I’ll say that people don’t always believe in a god out of fear, some do it because it brings comfort knowing you are not alone, it’s probabaly one of the larger reasons religion exists besides establishing an early set of rule enforcements. If they only believe out of fear, an omnipotent god would know that their belief is false, and the individual would know their own belief is false, therefore not bother believing </text>
