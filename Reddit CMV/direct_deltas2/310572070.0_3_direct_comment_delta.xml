    <title>CMV: Every straight girl out there secretly wants to date a rich guy</title>
    <original_poster>windmill230</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let's be honest here. Some girls say that they have no desire to date rich guys as they are looking for true love but really they are just lying. And as for girls who don't pursue rich guys, they secretly want to do this and the only reason why they did not do this is because they know that rich guys are out of their league.

Some people say that money is not a priority but really it is. Who doesn't want a rich husband who treats you nicely? "Money cannot buy happiness" is just a myth propagated by not-so-well-off people with a sour grapes mindset. The truth is deep down, everyone values money and secretly desires to be rich. I don't believe it when a girl says that she has no particular desire to date rich guys.

    <text>I don't agree with this at all. 

The first thing to accept is that you're making a generalization. That's fine. There can be some conversational merit in generalizations. The problem is, I don't even agree with the generalization. I'd like to put forward one of my own, which I think is much more accurate. 

Having said that, it's still a generalization, and doesn't apply to everyone. 

I think the first factor women are looking for is not wealth, but being a good provider. Women want to feel safe. They want to feel like they will be provided for, and their children will be provided for. And yes, wealth can represent that, and appeal to those instincts in women. But if a man shows he's capable of providing for her and her children, I don't think wealth is the critical factor in most cases. 

I think there are other factors which can be important. The ability to make a woman laugh. The ability to sing, or play guitar. Being desirable to other women can instinctually make a woman attracted to a man. Being an exceptional athlete. Being mysterious. Frankly, being aesthetically pleasing is extraordinarily important.  

None of these have anything to do with wealth. 

Which isn't to say that some women equate wealth with desirability. That's certainly the case. I just don't believe it's the vast majority as you do. All things being equal, sure, more money means more financial security, but if a man is able to provide for his family without great wealth, that's going to be enough in the vast majority of cases. </text>
