    <title>CMV: Bruce Willis' character in "The Jackal" is an overpriced and incompetent assassin.</title>

If you haven't seen the movie, Bruce Willis is hired to assassinate a politician. He asks for the absurd sum of 70 million dollars. You'd be surprised how little it actually costs to hire a hitman. 

http://priceonomics.com/how-much-does-a-hitman-cost/

An article I read about an undercover cop who posed as a hitman claims that 200,000 dollars was the most he was ever offered with the average being around 25,000. Granted, a high level politician is a much more high-profile target and would likely fetch a premium on the assassin market but 70 million is just too damn much. 

Nonetheless, The Jackal gets his money and then proceeds to do an incredibly sub-par assassination attempt. He starts by purchasing a "Polish ZSU-33 14.5mm" which is a huge heavy machinegun meant to be mounted on armored vehicles and used for shooting down aircraft. I forget the exact amount he paid for it, but I'm pretty sure it was in the tens of millions. He goes through this elaborate routine involving fake moustaches, accents, and passports to smuggle this massive auto-cannon into the country and hires Jack Black to build a electronically controlled mount for the weapon. After the mount is built, Jack Black's character attempts to extort more money out of The Jackal by vaguely suggesting that the extra money is worth his silence. Now, granted this isn't the most ethical thing to do, but he explains that it ended up being more work than expected and the price of some of the materials had gone up. Bruce Willis then brutally murders Jack Black with his crazy death machine which strikes me as a bit of an overreaction.

The whole concept of this device being used for a simple assassination is rediculous. Why can't he just use a rifle with a scope like a normal assassin? You can get a decent deer rifle and a scope for less than a thousand dollars. A heavy machinegun with depleted uranium bullets would make sense of your target was inside an armored vehicle or something but the target is out in the open, in public, making a speech. There's plenty of tall buildings and other vantage points in the area. The fact that the device is controlled remotely using a laptop is just asking for problems. Let's say the electric mount doesn't work, mission failed. The laptop isn't working? Mission failed. Bad WiFi signal? Mission failed. The more steps you add to the process, the more likely something will go wrong.

So, the day of the assassination comes and The Jackal has his remote controlled machinegun mounted in a minivan, and is sitting on a bench controlling the device via laptop computer. And shockingly, something goes wrong. He can't aim the gun properly and screws the whole thing up.

If there's an assassin's version of Yelp, I hope he got a terrible review.

    <text>I'm a physician and I've worked in a couple hospitals in big cities with lots of celebrities. A few years back I was at a hospital that saw a ton of celebrities, and one particular 20 something A list female celebrity (you definitely know her) happened to be in the hospital, in the psych ward. The press got wind of this. I was at a party talking to a guy who happened to be some kind of  photographer or journalist or something. We eventually started talking about that celeb and I mentioned that yea, I had seen her in the hospital. He offered me about $40k on the spot if I could get him pictures of her in the psych ward.*

The idea of a physician taking pics of a celeb in the hospital to give to the press, for $40k, is laughable. My earning potential is about $250k to $400k yearly, depending on how much I want to work. Over 30-50 year career that's maybe $10m in earnings, ignoring the enjoyment I get from my job. If I got caught taking pictures of an A list celeb to give to the press, I could easily lose my license, which would mean I would lose all that future earnings and enjoyment.

If you wanted me to take such a risk, you'd have to pay me at least on the order of several million dollars to make it worthwhile. You'd be paying me to take the risk, not for the quality of the job. 

Similarly, the Jackal was presumably a reputable professional who could find steady work doing less high profile hits. If some random undercover cop was getting offers of $200k, presumably a guy like the Jackal could do a couple hits a year in that range. His lifetime earning potential is probably in the range of $10m to $100m. Doing a high profile hit puts those earnings at risk, and on top of that puts his life and liberty at risk. Think about the international manhunt that would ensue after the assassination of a presidential candidate.   You'd probably have to offer him some tens of millions to make such a job worth the risk.

**tldr: You're paying a premium to make the risk worthwhile, not for the quality of the job.**
