    <title>CMV: women are a disease for an egalitarian society their mate selection instincts are not designed for modern society if left unleashed it will alienate men they consider shy, weak or ugly and increases instability and leads to massive struggle as nature intended.</title>

    <original_post>As studies have shown: https://www.livescience.com/58607-mens-looks-may-matter-more-than-personality.html
Women consider most men undesirable and although this an evolutionary pressure to choose better traits like masculine features or any physical advantage, it is a nightmare for society, all throughout the world suicides have risen among men and sperms counts have been dropped, it seems as if the current structure of society causes this, scrawny men, shy men, men who been in accidents and suffer from disabilities, I do not care about the solution I would not like it to be any inhumane way but current structure radicalises men, unless there are programs to specifically address the issue which is the mental health of undesired men there can not be peace.</original_post>

    <text>This is from the article that you linked: 

&amp;gt; Men are more consciously aware — or more willing to admit — that good looks in a woman are more important to them than personality, Fugère said.

So what about shy and ugly women? If your argument is about how searching for a partner based on physical attractiveness is detrimental to society, then why are you focusing on women’s preferences when men’s are, according to your own source, even worse in that regard?</text>
