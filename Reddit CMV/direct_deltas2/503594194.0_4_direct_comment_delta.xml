    <title>CMV: America doesn't need more STEM majors.</title>
    <original_poster>brotherhood4232</original_poster>
    <original_post>I used to follow the Reddit consensus that STEM = good and "basket weaving" majors = bad. I graduated with an electrical engineering degree myself. But after looking for a job myself, it doesn't seem like the job market could support a ton of more STEM majors.

I've seem very few job postings that said Entry Level. Most want 3\-5 years of experience and a host of qualifications that no new graduate will have. This means you are not only competing against other new graduates, but you are also competing against Mid\-Level STEM professionals. I think a flood of new STEM graduates would exacerbate this problem and a lot of those new engineers would be working at Starbucks. Change my view.</original_post>

    <text>You're confusing what people are saying, people are not saying that everyone should major in STEM, people are saying that if you are going to college, it only makes sense to major in STEM. 

College is expensive and TBH fairly obsolete in 2018. The only way to make college worth the time and money cost is if your earnings significantly outweigh the cost of college (keep in mind that the cost is more than just the tuition, its also the cost of not getting the money/career experience had you entered the work force vs college) 

I think a more fair view is to say that America doesn't need more college graduates, full stop. </text>
