    <title>I think eugenics should be practiced for humanity's sake. CMV</title>

    <original_post>1. Although some disabilities aren't hereditary, almost all disabilities and mental issues come from genetics and genetic issues. 

2. I only believe this for people who'd be a complete drain on society. Yes, there are exceptions like Stephen Hawking and what not, but that's exactly what they are. Exceptions. I believe there should be no debate over those who're mentally insane as well. 

3. I believe the government should force this because the parents wouldn't know right from wrong while being distraught by emotions. Ultimately, it would benefit the parents much more to abort the disabled child. Have you seen how much of a life-ruiner those disabled kids are? 

4. They also cause anxiety in the parents because of the thoughts of what will happen after they're not around. 

5. It may seem inhumane now, but keep in mind that I'm talking about abortion here. The disabled currently alive can live their lives and what not, I'm talking about those that aren't born yet. Right when the doctors find out that the kid will turn out fucked up, they should do something about it.

6. Okay, okay. So you're morally higher than me. I'm a monster for thinking this way. **Can you honestly look me in the eyes and tell me that the lives of those parents of fucked up kids wouldn't be much, much better without all that bullshit? How many parents are having their money and time drained because of this stuff?** </original_post>

    <text>I would agree with you in principle, but not in practice. Why? Because soon we would not need eugenics to achieve the goals you propose (with all its downsides, moral dillemas and slippery slopes). Everything eugenics promises we would soon be able to do with genetic engineering / gene therapy (designer babies). And its societally far easier eventually to pass a law that forces parents to submit their unborn kids to mandatory gene therapy to substitute their inferior genes with superior alleles while they are still embryos, than to force them to abort their babies. The former is morally far closer to mandatory vaccination (already a law in many countries) than to eugenics or reproduction control.

So even from an eugenicist's standpoint, I dont think its worth it to push for eugenic programs based on reproduction control in this day and age. Its got too much baggage, and genetic engineering will soon provide far more palatable alternative capable of the same, or even greater genetic benefits. Then we can perhaps advocate for making it mandatory for all children like vaccinations are.</text>
