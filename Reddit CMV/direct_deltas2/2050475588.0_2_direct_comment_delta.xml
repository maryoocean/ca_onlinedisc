    <title>CMV: The only difference between AI (digital) life and human (physical) life is the material which sustains it</title>
    <original_poster>CarpeBedlam</original_poster>
    <original_post>To be clear, I’m talking about a theoretical AI which is designed specifically to be indistinguishable from a human, and accomplishes that goal. Also, I don’t necessarily mean an android that is physically equivalent (e.g. Ash from “Alien”), but just a digital consciousness living in a computer which is capable of replicating human behavior. At that point, I’m struggling to find a difference between the two that isn’t solely about the material required to sustain the life (blood, tissue, etc. for human life, silicon, copper, etc. for AI life).</original_post>

    <text>Given that this AI would actually be sentient, I agree with the prior statement. However, this theoretical consciousness is something that will always remain theoretical.

I’m sure we could mimic the outward appearance of being conscious, but that all it would take for you to believe that you are interacting with a subject of a life? We don’t even understand what makes US sentient. How do you propose we create that with all different materials?</text>
