    <title>CMV: The Allies started WW2</title>
    <original_poster>SC2_BUSINESSMAN</original_poster>
    <original_post>First of all, the Treaty of Versailles was *way* too harsh, and everyone knew it. The hyperinflation that followed as a result of this Treaty was a huge factor that caused the German economy to collapse. In addition, events such as [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Ruhr) where France occupied Germany and killed civilians is basically what enabled Hitler to rise to power and garner enough support.

The [Polish Corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Corridor) was also a joke. Lots of ethnic germans were separated from East Germany, and there was no other option than for Germany to start invading or suffer from severe consequences such as economic collapse, overpopulation, and continuing to be bullied by the Allies. 

The only way out of this situation was to create infrastructure geared towards war, which would enable a lot of jobs to be created and for Germany to annex areas such as the Sedetenland and Rhineland which were important strategic areas, as well as reuniting scattered Germans. </original_post>

    <text>You're explaining why Germany went to war. Everything you've stated might not be wrong, but you're pretending that the other nations didn't make concessions. They let Germany have multiple territories back, let them remilitarise the rhineland, cut down the total costs of reparations.

Germany continued to ask for more. And more and more. Even after being warned that their actions would cause war they pushed on forward. Germany wouldn't have fallen apart as bad as you suggest. Some years of hardship certainly, but not total collapse of the nation. </text>
