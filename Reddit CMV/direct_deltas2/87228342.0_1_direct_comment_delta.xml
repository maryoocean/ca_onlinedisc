    <title>True privacy has always been imagined. Our only concern should be right to due process; everyting else is a distraction. CMV</title>

    <original_post>Most of us aren't as sneaky as we think. So, our concept of "privacy" has always been more of a feigned ignorance by our peers, dependents, and authority figures. Restated, it is more likely than not, that in the chaos of our lives, we've let slip each of our dirty little secrets at one point or another. Therefore, perceived violations of privacy are a violation of our imagination.

The judiciary has been tasked with declaring what facts can be brought in support of our guilt or innocence. So, our primary concern should not be keeping secrets but rather, ensuring our right to a fair trial. Outrage over privacy violations feels good but it serves nothing.

Please change my view.</original_post>

    <text>The main problem with your statement is that a trial isn't necessary to ruin someone's reputation or even their life. There are many things that aren't illegal that people would prefer to be kept secret for exactly that reason. With surveillance information being so easily available it's possible to threaten or blackmail people who haven't done anything wrong.</text>
