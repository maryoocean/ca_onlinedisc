    <title>CMV: Downfall of News Networks is a Good Thing</title>
    <original_poster>mindtug</original_poster>
    <original_post>News thrives off fear mongering which has been detrimental for America. For instance ‘stranger danger’ caused kids across America to be locked indoors which isn’t great for development and mental health because the fear of some van taking them away, while the likelihood of your kids being kidnapped is actually extremely low. Same thing with tough on crime that went overboard causing mass incarceration and lengthened prison times making America have the biggest prisoner poppulation in the world. News talk about “How we’re more divided than ever” but they’re probably the biggest contributors. It’s important to know what’s happening but global networks such as CNN and Fox are too sensational for me to support. Should I feel sad they’re dying?</original_post>

    <text>News Networks aren't great.

The problem is that people are transitioning to getting their "news" from Facebook/twitter/etc: reposts of individuals who are not held accountable to any particular standard.

News Networks are known and when they mess up, they hold one another accountable and the public holds them accountable. There's actually a publisher to target. But random reposts on Facebook that disseminate misinformation have no identified publisher and there's no way to hold them accountable.

So no, the decline of News Networks isn't a good thing--because News Networks are being replaced with something even worse.</text>
