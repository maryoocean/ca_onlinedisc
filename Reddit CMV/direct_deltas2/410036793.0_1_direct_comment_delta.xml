    <title>CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are not ethically superior to standard omnivorous diet</title>
    <original_poster>Kor03d</original_poster>
    <original_post>There is no point in becoming vegan or vegetarian in effort to save animals lives. Suffering or even death of a farm animal are no different to those of a tomato, even if it is harder to emotionally compassionate to the latter, as it is easier for us to relate to animal feelings. You can not exist without ending other creatures life for food, and animal lives are not more important than plants or fungi in that regard.

Please note that does not account for switching diet for own health reasons.

*EDIT: Yes, in my view I consider that plants can suffer even if they don't have the same mechanisms of perception animals do. Jellyfishes don't have a nervous system anywhere close to ours, yet it would still be unethical to cut one in pieces for amusement. Jellyfish would still perceive injury and its normal biological cycles would be hindered. Same goes for plants*

    <text>The important thing to understand is that there are more than one ethical systems, and before we argue whether something is ethical or not, we **must** define which one we're using. If in your system it is unethical to kill creatures with nervous systems for food, vegetarianism is, in that system, ethically superior (plants don't have nervous systems and can not "suffer" in animal sense). If in your system kiling anything, regardless of the nervous system, is bad (e.g. if you subscribe to concepts like soul, reincarnation etc.), then both are equally unethical. If your ethical system allows killing for food in general, vegetarianism is of course no more ethical than carnivorousness *in that system*.

We can compare different ethical systems according to their practicality, utility, relation to reality etc., but ethical judgements are only possible inside a particular system and can not be made outside of a system or between systems.</text>
