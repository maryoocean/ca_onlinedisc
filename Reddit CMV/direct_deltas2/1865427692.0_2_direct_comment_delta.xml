    <title>CMV: Saying white people in general shouldn't feel guilty for the actions of specific, individual white people isn't an example of white fragility.</title>
    <original_poster>LucidMetal</original_poster>
    <original_post>I was recently banned from /whitepeopletwitter for this comment:

&amp;gt;I don't think "white people" need to feel guilty about this. You're just internalizing an issue over which you don't have control. What we need to do is figure out a way to combat the revisionist history narratives and misinformation that are plaguing conservative spheres (I don't want to say "echo chamber" because let's be honest everyone lives in an echo chamber these days).

I don't care that I was banned to be clear. I do care that the reason seemed incorrect. The reason given was:

&amp;gt;White fragility is racist.

I do believe "white fragility" as a concept exists in America i.e. many white people exhibit a negative reaction including anger, fear, guilt, arguing, silence, or leaving the stress-inducing situation when they encounter discussions of race. I have no idea how pervasive it is because I don't encounter it very frequently but I have encountered it and I know my friends who belong to minority racial groups say it happens frequently for them. 

I don't think the ban was justified (but who cares) and I don't think white fragility is racism (I suppose easy delta here if you can show me why) but I also don't see why my comment is an example of white fragility.

As far as I remember it's the opposite! It was saying OP should not feel guilt when discussing the Buffalo shooter since it was a specific person with a specific worldview not "white people". I can't post the comment I was responding to because it's been deleted but it was along the lines of "white people should feel guilty for the Buffalo shooter".

EDIT: Alright, found the parent using Unddit! This is what I was responding to:

&amp;gt;“My kids shouldn’t feel guilty for slavery two hundred years ago!”

&amp;gt;News flash asshole, they should feel guilty for what happened in the past week.</original_post>

    <text>White fragility is highly contextual, and whether or not your comment was an example of it is up to interpretation, and it looks like others have argued about that elsewhere in this thread.

Instead, I'd like to try and take a shot at this belief:

&amp;gt;I don't think white fragility is racism

First lets get the definition of white fragility clear because a lot of things have been proposed in these comments. In a nutshell, white fragility typically refers to the **discomfort that many white people feel when discussing racial issues, possibly accompanied by defensiveness.** It's not just "saying anything non-affirming about race" or "disagreeing with a person of color," as I read in a few comments here. Let's look at a few examples:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

&amp;gt;Person A: "Hey your remarks earlier were racially insensitive to our coworker."  
Person B: "Oh no it's ok I'm not racist. I went to a march last year."

Person B is exhibiting fragility because they are attempting to absolve themself of wrongdoing, while ignoring the real harm they may have caused. They are taking a defensive stance rather than listening to feedback.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

&amp;gt;Person A: "Black lives matter"  
Person B: "No, all lives matter"

The "all lives matter" retort to the BLM movement is indeed an example of white fragility. Person B is misinterpreting the BLM slogan as an attack against themself, ignoring that the slogan is a rather a statement about the widespread disregard for the well being of people of color.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

&amp;gt;Person A: "Something needs to be done about police brutality against minorities."  
Person B: "Not all people are racist, it's just a few bad apples."

Person B is exhibiting fragility by excusing individual actions, thereby distancing themself from the harm being caused even though that wasn't what was being discussed. They are therefore ignoring the systematic racism that perpetuated those individual actions.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

White fragility tends to deflect the conversation away from the problem of *institutional* racism and focuses on denying *individual* racism, which is problematic because in order to combat institutional racism, we must be aware of its existence and our inevitable part in it.

In summary, white fragility doesn't mean you specifically hold racist beliefs. White fragility is considered racist because it perpetuates systematic racism.</text>
