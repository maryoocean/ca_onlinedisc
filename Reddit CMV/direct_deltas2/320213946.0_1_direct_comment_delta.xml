    <title>CMV: If you think abortion is murder, you can only have 1 specific opinion on it.</title>
    <original_poster>Send_Me_Trump_Nudes</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let's start this by saying I don't want to have any arguments about whether abortion is murder or not. I really feel like someone is going to think I am pro-life, I am not. However, my argument is basically saying that IF and only IF you do believe abortion is murder, you can only have the following specific opinion on it:

Abortion is wrong in all cases, INCLUDING rape, except for cases where the mother's health is at risk. 

So basically the main argument is that even rape shouldn't be aborted if abortion really is murder to someone. Here is why. 

If abortion is murder, then it isn't OK. Pretty simple right?
But then you have to get down to the different nuances. Rape is absolutely horrible, but if we assume abortion is murder; murdering because you were raped still doesn't make sense.

Murdering because you might die and you don't want to take a gamble makes sense, as horrible as it is, which is why mothers health is the one exception.

Would like to also include that I am not simply talking about pro-lifers, as there are many variances and AFAIK not all pro-lifers necessarily think abortion is literally murder. 

Thank you, now change my view. :)

Edit: Thank you for the replies, my view has been changed. 

 Just to clarify the murder thing I was only using because I see a lot of pro-lifers use it. I don't really care about the specific wording that should be used, point is that you are killing someone. or someone is dying. Whatever word you would like, imagine I used it.

    <text>**Note:** I shall be using the term "killing" instead. Under the way most people use the term "murder," it is always immoral because that's baked into the meaning

You can think abortion is killing a person and still be okay with abortion for bodily autonomy reasons. In my country (USA) your right to bodily autonomy is so strong that if you die of a heart attack we won't cut you open and use our organs to save people's lives if you didn't say it was okay before you died. I personally don't like this, but a lot of people do and it's the law. So, let's assume I believe my bodily autonomy trumps all.

Suppose I wake up and find myself plugged into a dialysis machine that is using my kidneys to filter someone else's blood. Do I have the right to unilaterally unplug myself and kill the other person? It seems like from the first paragraph the answer could morally be "yes." It would certainly be legal to do so in the USA. What if I opted into the machine and changed my mind later? The answer could very plausibly still be "yes."

If you think about abortion similarly, it makes sense. Yes it's killing a living person but it's using my body and I don't want it to.</text>
