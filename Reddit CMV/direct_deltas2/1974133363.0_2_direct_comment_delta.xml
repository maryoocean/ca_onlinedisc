    <title>CMV: Westerners should be deeply worried by our nations' inefficiency when building infrastructure</title>
    <original_poster>Real_Carl_Ramirez</original_poster>
    <original_post>I was recently watching this video: [The Â£100BN Railway Dividing a Nation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSD5ps9bLQ0) (it is about extreme delays and cost blowouts with the UK's HSR2 project). Similarly in the USA, the [California High-Speed Rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_High-Speed_Rail) also has extreme delays and cost blowouts.

It reminds me of what I've seen here in Australia:

* In Sydney, the [CBD and South East Light Rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBD_and_South_East_Light_Rail) was [delayed by over a year](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8102513/Sydneys-light-rail-faces-delay-troubled-project-set-held-back.html) and had [a 1.2 billion AUD cost blowout](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-07/light-rail-contractor-sues-nsw-government/9629948).
* In Adelaide, the mere electrification of the [Gawler railway line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawler_railway_line) [cost 900 million AUD and was delayed by almost 2 years](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-04-02/free-substitute-buses-for-adelaides-gawler-train-line/100961484).
* Nationwide, the [NBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network) had a cost blowout, costing [51 billion AUD](https://archive.ph/jL764) instead of the [original forecast of 29.5 billion AUD](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-13/federal-election-nbn-promises-past-and-present/7506714). Keep in mind that this is the cheaper, slower version of the NBN instead of the original version, and thus [Australia ranks #56 in internet speeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Internet_connection_speeds), behind even highly-censored nations like Russia, Saudi Arabia and the PRC.

Before you tell me "*that's because your country is corrupt*", that doesn't make it any less worrying. If western nations constantly face cost blowouts and delays with infrastructure projects, how can we possibly have hope that we can enjoy fast internet in the future? Or clear up transport problems? Or build the infrastructure needed for sustainable development? 

There's a reason why more countries support the PRC's [territorial claims](https://thediplomat.com/2016/07/who-supports-china-in-the-south-china-sea-and-why/) and [policies against Uyghurs](https://archive.ph/wip/8QMbX) than oppose them. Namely, it's because the PRC has been able to buy the loyalty of nations because it's well-known for quickly and cost-effectively building infrastructure for them. I don't want to shill for the PRC here, but Western countries' inefficiency when building infrastructure makes it harder for us to buy the loyalty of nations with this trick.

It's not like western nations are inherently incapable of efficiently building infrastructure (which is another reason why this recent trend of extreme delays and cost blowouts should be worrying):

* Australia's Snowy Mountains Scheme cost the equivalent of [6 billion AUD](https://web.archive.org/web/20060919222034/http://www.ministers.dotars.gov.au/ja/pressconf/2004/APC9_2004.htm)
* The USA's lunar landing effort cost the equivalent of [280 billion USD](https://www.planetary.org/space-policy/cost-of-apollo)
* The Channel Tunnel linking the UK to France cost the equivalent of [12 billion GBP](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/france/articles/channel-tunnel-facts/)</original_post>

    <text>Two ideas that don't show up in your analysis:

1) Unions/Prevaling Wage. A lot of the price inflation we see have to do with the premium the US and other nations pay for the labor.  

2) This is more US-based, but takings.  The United States is required by law to pay fair market value for public takings.  It means negotiating with each landowner along a proposed path. It's not cheap.

The good news? Your question is still easy to answer:

&amp;gt;  If western nations constantly face cost blowouts and delays with infrastructure projects, how can we possibly have hope that we can enjoy fast internet in the future? Or clear up transport problems? Or build the infrastructure needed for sustainable development?

As it stands, the United States does not have a problem with getting *necessary* infrastructure.

* [94% of Americans have access to *both* high speed land broadband and 4G mobile broadband] (https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/broadband-progress-reports/fourteenth-broadband-deployment-report).
* We spend well over $300 billion annually across federal, state, and local infrastructure appropriations in the United States, and the focus on infrastructure has resulted in [a drop in "poor" ratings for bridges] (https://www.bts.gov/content/condition-us-highway-bridges) and [improved road conditions] (https://www.bts.gov/content/condition-us-roadways-functional-system).

The one thing that isn't addressed in these is so-called "sustainable development," which is not understood as infrastructure in normal conversation.  Even still, the number of social programs specifically targeting poverty and disadvantaged populations is rising overall.

So no, there's no reason for western nations to worry about our infrastructure needs at this point in time.
