    <title>CMV: The notion that the Democrats or Republicans "must" run Biden or Trump "because there are no other viable candidates" is ridiculous. There are thousands of people who would make better presidential candidates for 2024 than Biden or Trump.</title>

    <original_post>Every argument for Biden or Trump to run in 2024 boils down to some version of "status quo" or "inertia." We're told that the Ds and Rs have no choice but to run these super-old candidates because there's nobody else who could be suitable.

&amp;#x200B;

In a nation of 332,000,000 people, there are well over 100 million who are over the age of 35, American-born, and have resided in the United States for 14 years or more - in other words, are constitutionally eligible to run for president.

Out of those 100 million, surely at least half have a basic education, are mature, sensible, decent people, and have demonstrated solid character - and also be significantly younger than Trump or Biden.

Out of those 50 million, surely at least ten million would qualify as *highly* educated - the metrics of which can be tricky to figure out (is it a master's degree? or something else?) - but they would be significantly above average.

Out of those 10 million, surely at least one million would be quite exceptional - people who have substantially high IQ, have advanced quite far in life and a career - such as being a doctor, or having worked in public governmental service for decades, etc.

And out of those million, surely at least 10,000 would have the political know-how, the charisma, the political interest, maybe have spent significant time abroad in foreign countries or speak multiple languages, to be a suitable president.

In fact, even in Congress, state legislatures or governorships alone, there must be dozens of good, qualified, educated, experienced politicians who would be much younger than Trump or Biden, and who would make suitable presidential candidates. 

So, CMV on this one. I don't buy for one moment the notion that, in a nation of 332 million people, America somehow has no choice but to run Biden vs. Trump in 2024 because "we've got no one else who'd be a good candidate."  </original_post>

    <text>The problem with your argument is you think it's the DNC or the RNC who decides who to run.  It's not.  We the voters vote in the primaries to decide who runs. The DNC and RNC sometimes do things to put their hands on the scale but overall they don't apply so much pressure that a very popular candidate wouldn't win.

It's very, very rare that if the incumbent president runs in the primary that they lose.  Which means that baring some extreme upset, Biden will be the nominee if he continues to want to run.  Part of this is because no good candidate would want to challenge their parties incumbent.  This is largely because generally whether they win or lose, it damages their party's chance of winning in the general election.

Trump's base is insanely loyal.  It's questionable whether he can win enough independents while not losing non-MAGA to the extreme republican voters to actually beat Biden in the general election but it will be extremely hard for anyone else to win the primary election. 

The DNC or the RNC COULD change the rules to state that either candidate isn't allowed to run.  However the blowback, especially if the RNC did so, would be insane and likely cripple their chances of winning.  If the party leaders dictated who could be the nominee or even who can't be the nominee they'd be dealing with a lot of political problems.

Primaries don't usually give us the best people to run, it gives us the people who can convince primary voters that they are the best.  Part of the issue of course is that very few people vote in the primaries even compared to the general election.</text>
