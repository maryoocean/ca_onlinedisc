    <title>CMV: We don't possess a rational mind only to sometimes think irrationally, and we don't evolve to get here only for some of us to feel complacent not to go any further at anything.</title>

    <original_post>I don't know, it just doesn't come to me that these faults of irrationality and not wanting to improve still exist within us all. The cause of basically all the world's issues, why we never get stuff done, the one thing holding us all back. What's more perplexing is the very attempt at fixing these "faults" is seen as something very detrimental. 

A case of tall poppy syndrome? Is this the limit of our improvement? Is there some sort of a kill switch preventing us from becoming uncontrolled? Is rationality in fact the undesirable byproduct of evolution? We're given opportunity to be awesome and the right ways to get there, and we just reject them? I just need to understand what I've been missing.</original_post>

    <text>From the perspective of evolution, rational thought is just a means to an end. It is by no means the overarching goal for everybody. Rational decisions take more time than intuitive ones, and in many cases time is more important than ultimate correctness. Furthermore, emotional responses may sometimes be more relatable than purely rational ones, so it gives you an edge in communication to sometimes think irrationally.</text>
