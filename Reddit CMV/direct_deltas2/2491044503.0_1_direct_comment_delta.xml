    <title>CMV: The US is on the brink of Civil War 2: Electric Boogaloo.</title>

    <original_post>A bit of a doomer post, I know, but this is why I am here.

I think the trends in the US are terrifying and will have a catastrophic climax in the near future. Civil unrest seems to be at an all-time high due to a variety of factors. I am very left/libertarian leaning and I see right wing and liberal outlets promoting highly charged news, racial tensions on the rise, police brutality, class warfare, and identity politics taking center stage as major contributors.

The news. Headlines are what news outlets thrive on, and the more extreme or outrage-y drive traffic to the articles, meaning that positive and uplifting stories are either left in the dust or not written in favor of something more likely to increase engagement. This means that context and nuance are buried in favor of opinion pieces that cause people to be irritable or in despair. Reporting biases gear audiences to a place of discontent. I know this isn't necessarily a bad thing on its own, as this can be a catalyst for change, but given some sources and motivations, such as right wing media trying to cause change against "wokeness", this can ruin interpersonal relations as people begin to hate their fellow person. I know that politics has a massive presense in society, but when people see humans just existing as "political" or "woke", they can easily otherize humans into something not themselves, making it easier to hate.

Racial tensions. This is relatively self explanatory as white supremacists are pouring out of the woodworks to attack movements like BLM and policies like Affirmative Action. It makes it difficult to be a person like me, cis, white, male, and working in security. I know I make black people uncomfortable because without knowing me, they might be quick to assume I have white supremacist ideals or biases. Anecdotally, I had to pull aside a group of black kids at one of my posts because they were causing problems at the establishment, and I kept having to get onto them about what they were doing. I pulled them aside to explain how the actions they were engaging in were problematic for the establishment and why management kept having me get onto them. Basically a "look, people are paying for a certain experience, and are complaining because you are getting in the way and being disruptive. If you want to be here, that is fine, but you have to follow the rules." As I was talking to them, an older black gentleman walked by and stopped to listen to what I was telling them. He told me after they left that he appreciated the way I talked to them and handled the situation maturely, and he stuck by because he was a little nervous because he saw "a white rent-a-cop talking to a group of black kids" and he wanted to make sure that everything was on the up and up, which I totally get. We talked for a while about the state of police and race issues, and largely agreed on several positions.

Which brings me to my next point, police brutality. It is no secret that Law Enforcement is... problematic in the US. I know it isn't just the US, but my focus is here right now. Connecticut just had several hundred police busted for over 20,000 fake and falsified tickets over a several year time span. As phone footage and body cam footage is released we see a really dark reality for minorities in the US. People being murdered or beaten for a variety of reasons, dogs being released on people and uncontrolled, and militarization of the police force given budgets that far outweigh things like parks and recreation or mental health. These issues are felt nation-wide and the average citizen can do nothing to redress their grievances, or it further hurts them because the State backs the cops. Qualified Immunity has been abused to the point where cops can just violate your rights and get away with it because "they couldn't have known they were violating your rights". The average citizen is powerless against the police, which is by design. If a cop draws on me and I were to shoot in self-defense, I would have a greater degree of a burden of proof than a cop would if it were the other way around, or even if I didn't draw. We saw that with kids being murdered by police for toy guys or adults being murdered for a hairbrush that was assumed to be a weapon.

Class warfare. People are being kicked out of house and home due to wage stagnation and supression, while the rich just get richer. We can see a direct example of that concept with the Hollywood debacle. Streaming services are massively profitable, requiring next to no cost compared to the older ways of distribution, and yet shareholders are raking in profits while actors and writers are being paid less overall due to the elimination of residuals through the streaming model. Massive shifts in technological advancements result in more money being accumulated by those already at the top. While I can go on about the inherant flaws of a profit-driven economy, the real facts are that CEOs and investors are gaining net worth and value while every day citizens are struggling to get by. More and more Americans are living paycheck to paycheck because of these things.

Identity politics. For whatever reason, LGBT+ issues are now taking the forefront of the GOP's platform. "Wokeness" is something that they are now dedicated to fighting, with baseless accusations being thrown against these minority groups of grooming and pedophilia, with the rise of acceptance and more people feeling comfortable enough about coming out being used as evidence of a conspiracy to turn everyone trans and gay. Children taught that it is OK to be different are somehow being indoctrinated in to this cult of degenerate behavior. The falsified outrage against the minority groups is being used to motivate hate crimes against anyone who supports them. Are there discussions that can be had about the type of information and when it is appropriate? Sure, but this isn't their goal. It was not and never has been about "protecting children" evidenced by the anti-trans bills being passed nation-wide that are trying to ban or raise the age to 25.

There are other issues at play, like rising mass violence and conspiracy theories, but these are kind of my main focuses. I am terrified that we are going to see an unresolvable schism in American society that will lead to a civil war with a death toll higher than any war to date. The lines won't be as clean this time, since before, people were mostly aligned with their state. In this time period, I would be more likely to catch a bullet from my neighbor than someone from another state, as was the case in the Civil War we know from history. Please, restore my faith in our ability to avert this catastrophy and come to a better solution. Some of my positions, such as my ideology or views on minorities and trans, you will not be able to change, those aren't the focus of this CMV. I just don't want to be worried I wake up and hearing about the new Fort Sumter.</original_post>

    <text>This is just a list of problems in the country, not an argument as to why they would lead to civil war.

While civil war is often cloaked in ideology, it actually occurs for economic reasons. In the American Civil War, the country was split very clearly along geographical lines. When the addition of new free states outnumbered the addition of slave states, the southern slave states feared the free states would outlaw slavery, which would radically transform the entire economy of the south, and heavily shift the balance of economic and political power in the country. As a result, the southern slave states revolted.

There is nothing really akin to this in the modern U.S. The geographical divide is far less clear-cut, and more along rural/urban geographical lines.

Wokeness and identity politics are just flavor-of-the-day squabbles that everyone forgets about immediately. Everyone will forget about Jason Aldean and Bud Light by next Monday.

As for racial justice, if we can survive the turmoil of the 1960s without civil war, we can certainly survive today.

I’m short, there’s simply no major intersection of economics and geography today that would recreate the consistions for civil war.</text>
