    <title>CMV: If I'm not guilty, I want to be tried by a judge rather than a jury</title>
    <original_poster>Mimshot</original_poster>
    <original_post>In the American criminal justice system you have the *right* to a jury trial, but you are not obligated to exercise your right a jury. It's possible to have what's known as a "bench trial" where in addition to determining the admissibility of evidence, and sentencing if convicted, the judge determines guilt or innocence as well.

Jury trials are notoriously unpredictable, therefore if I'm actually not guilty of a crime, I want a professional judging my case. Historically, bench trials result in acquittals [more often than from juries](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/judge_v_judge). I understand wanting to be judged by someone who never saw inadmissible evidence, if I'm guilty but the evidence was illegally obtained, but if I'm actually not guilty, why should I take a chance with a jury?

Change my view.

    <text>I do criminal defense and the question of whether or not to use a judge or jury is one that comes up on a regular basis.  

Let me start with "if I'm guilty but the evidence was illegally obtained, but if I'm actually not guilty, why should I take a chance with a jury?"  Illegally obtained evidence is actually a point toward juries in my opinion.  If there was illegally obtained evidence your attorney will likely make a motion to suppress before the trial.  Motions are heard without a jury with only a judge.  If you're having a bench (judge) trial, the judge will consider the legality of the evidence and then simply exclude it from his consideration.  If you're having a jury trial, the judge will exclude the information pretrial and the jury will never hear it.  We like to pretend judges can simply not consider what they hear, but they're people and I don't always trust them.  If the case has a lot of legal issues that can be resolved pretrial, I would lean toward jury.  

Juries also tend to be more prejudiced than judges do.  That can be really bad if you're a black man in a rural white community, but it can also be good if you're a white man in that same jurisdiction and the chief witness against you is a black man.  More common is if the chief witness is currently incarcerated and will come in to testify in a jail uniform and the defendant is also in jail.  The judge will know you're both in jail, but the jury won't.  The jury will see a witness in peels but a defendant in court appropriate attire.  Juries being bad can be good with the right circumstances.  

The vast majority of the jury trials I set however are for people who I think are innocent....or at least the people I don't think there is enough evidence to convict.  Setting a jury forces a prosecutor's hand.  Juries are a LOT of work.  Setting a case for jury often gets better offers, and often a straight up dismissal.  Setting it for jury is sometimes like a game of chicken, and if you're willing to go to trial the best bet for getting it dropped without the risk of a trial is to risk the jury and hope the other side is too lazy or too scared to take the case to trial.  

Basically, choosing jury or judge is not so simple as actually innocent or not.  There are a lot of things to consider, and while bench trials ARE often better, there are situations where a jury may be more likely to get you the result you want.  Guilty or innocent, you should never firmly make the decision as to judge or jury without consulting your attorney.  </text>
