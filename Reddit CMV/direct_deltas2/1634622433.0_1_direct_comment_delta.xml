    <title>CMV: "Likes," "Reactions," and "Upvotes" should be removed from social media sites.</title>
    <original_poster>AmigoDelDiabla</original_poster>
    <original_post>These reactions, whether positive or negative, reduce online engagement to anonymous, binary interactions.  They lack nuance, insight, or accountability.  And they are *wildly* misinterpreted in that they don't convey degree.  A high quantity of likes, or dislikes, just means a number of people saw and reacted to a statement/post/comment, but not the degree to which they reacted.  Especially in the event of downvotes/dislikes, I too often see the OP react as if that conveys hate.  Nah, it usually just means people disagree with you.

And it goes without saying how positive reactions can distort the owner's perspective of how his or her work is received.</original_post>

    <text>Maybe stop looking at upvotes as approval and they won't matter to you so much. It's all just a filter to keep spam and malicious intent off the platform. And idiots. It does help keep away the idiots.</text>
