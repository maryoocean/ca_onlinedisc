    <title>CMV: Cooking up shit against famous dead people should be put to a stop immediately, as they are not there to defend themselves and will never be.</title>

    <original_post>I know Charlie Chaplin dated people up to 15 years younger than him, but now and then I always wonder whether some shitheads decided to cook up shit against him because he was dead and there would be nobody to contradict their statements. And then there's Bob Marley, the conspiracies against whom I am having serious doubts. Why would anybody bully his way to the top just for some fat cash, and then slide back to obscurity? And then there is Elvis, who dated virgin girls and fucked them albeit Priscilla herself downplayed these allegations. I do not understand it. Someone help me.</original_post>

    <text>Is there a difference between 'cooking up things' and legitimate criticism? For example I'd say there's value in acknowlaging that people we used to idolise had flaws we used to overlook. Why does them being dead suddenly mean what they do isn't worthy of criticism? 

What does it matter whether or not they're there to defend themselves? By the same token they aren't there to be offended, and anyone who would be offended would still be there to defend the other person.</text>
