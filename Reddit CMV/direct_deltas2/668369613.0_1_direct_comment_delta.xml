    <title>CMV: The question of "do we live in a simulation" doesn't matter</title>
    <original_poster>mix_420</original_poster>
    <original_post>I say this for two reasons:

1. You can't prove it. Can't really think of anything you can't explain with common sense that proves that we live in a simulation.
2. There's no point in it. I don't see how life changes in any way if you were to know you were in a simulation. I understand that knowledge is a great thing and we should try to get knowledge even if it doesn't matter, but because of #1 it makes it pointless.

Basically what I'm saying here is there's no point in asking this question if you will never have the answer to it, considering the only reason to ask the question is for the knowledge of it, as you'll never achieve it.</original_post>

    <text>Number 1 I will grant. But not number 2. It all depends on the type of simulation we are talking about here. If we are talking about a matrix simulation where I exist somewhere and so does everyone else, even in a vat and we are all interacting then you're right it changes nothing. However, if we are living in a solipcistic simulation then it changes everything. If you don't know what solipcism is, it's the belief that you are the only real person in the world. Think of it like a video game. You are a real thinking thing and everyone else is just an NPC. If I found out I was living in a solipcistic simulation I would 100% commit suicide. Thats a totally serious argument. Look, life is shit and going to work is a pain in the ass. I certainly don't enjoy being here. If I was to find out that I could just off myself guilt free without hurting a single real person then I would totally go for it. Not to mention all the other things that automatically become perfectly morally acceptable with a solipcostic simulation. Rape, murder, (if those terms even apply anymore?) whatever. None of it is "wrong" because all of it becomes a victimless crime.</text>
