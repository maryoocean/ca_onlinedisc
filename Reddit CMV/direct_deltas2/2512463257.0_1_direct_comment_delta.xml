    <title>CMV: Québec was right to ban prayer rooms, religion doesn't belong in schools.</title>

    <original_post>Public Schools are secular organizations, and no religion should be present there. I apply this equally across all religions. No prayer rooms, no cross necklaces, no hijabs, no sikh turbans, no jew hats. School is not a place for religion, and it does not belong there. You wanna have religion in school, go find a theorcracy. Québec is making the right call to ban the prayer rooms, no religion should be tolerated in schools.

I can't even see how anybody would think otherwise, why would you allow religion in schools? France makes kids take off their hijabs, and nobody who's opinion matters is upset about that.</original_post>

    <text>There is a major flaw in the Quebec law that you have not mentioned, and that nobody has even tried to raise up:

It fails to address the concept of personal freedom. A student cannot and should not be put under psychological stress they have very little or no control over, for the sake of secularism.

For schools, I accept the value that schools themselves should not push a specific religion, such as declaring prayer times, making prayers sessions, or creating a sense of shame for not participating in a form of prayer or the other, and if they want to address religious stuff it should be done in an informative, neutral way that bolsters interpersonal conversation, rather than stifles it.

There is a difference between secularism, and secular tyranny, and you are encouraging the latter.</text>
