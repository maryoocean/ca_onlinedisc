    <title>CMV: We don't possess a rational mind only to sometimes think irrationally, and we don't evolve to get here only for some of us to feel complacent not to go any further at anything.</title>

    <original_post>I don't know, it just doesn't come to me that these faults of irrationality and not wanting to improve still exist within us all. The cause of basically all the world's issues, why we never get stuff done, the one thing holding us all back. What's more perplexing is the very attempt at fixing these "faults" is seen as something very detrimental. 

A case of tall poppy syndrome? Is this the limit of our improvement? Is there some sort of a kill switch preventing us from becoming uncontrolled? Is rationality in fact the undesirable byproduct of evolution? We're given opportunity to be awesome and the right ways to get there, and we just reject them? I just need to understand what I've been missing.</original_post>

    <text>First we need to agree that individuals have ability to think rationally, improve and "get stuff done". If this isn't true then tall poppy syndrome wouldn't be a thing (because there wouldn't be any tall poppies).

Secondly we need to take step back and look group where cohesion is not maintained. Group where individuality is put ahead of common good. In these cases most brutal, aggressive and selfish individuals will hoard power and wealth in expense of others. We need to stop these "tall poppies" for benefit of all.

Finally we have to come to conclusion that it's hard to distinguish between selfish go-getters that will exploit everyone around them and selfless go-getters whose actions will benefit all. Often it's too late to stop them before we know which one they are. Also when power corrupts even the good hearted people and if they get too tall they will start blocking the sun for the rest even if they don't initially wish so.</text>
