    <title>CMV: Reviewers (Oscars, IGN)of any kind are worse than random reviews of consumers</title>
    <original_poster>sploog_cruise</original_poster>
    <original_post>You see it with gaming, restaurants, movies, hotels and the like. I will say this that for some businesses like Hotels at least there is SOME incentive because theyll at least tell you if youre going to get ripped off, but with games they will lie about bugs as with F76.



Reviewers are so often rigged and bribed that their reviews become meaningless. Then the remaining reviews often rely on what fits their agenda, and then the occasional review that perfectly aligns with popular opinion to increase credibility. 

A review will tell you something about what you can expect, but they are also often misleading and therefor WORSE than a review by a customer. (although customer review are often also rigged) 

Really, if you base your opinion of anything from reviews or award, even stuff like the Oscars, you're likely less informed than someone who looks at it logically 

It honestly baffles me that anyone still respects these and people use things like "it won X oscars or IGN gave it an 9/10" as an argument to do something

The blandest mass produced stuff will get good reviews because its a large company that pays or scares the reviewers/awards with lawsuits to do their thing. Why does anybody even trust them?</original_post>

    <text>While I agree that mainstream reviews may appear rigged, compliant with an agenda, or promote an average product, I disagree that they are “worse” than random consumer reviews. All reviews serve a purpose just as all news sources serve a purpose, regardless of bias. Together, they build a collective picture of an experience. 

Do I trust the NYT critic of cold sesame noodles more than I trust the Yelp reviewer who thinks it tastes like Skippy peanut butter? Maybe. Do I trust my friend’s opinion of a movie more than the Academy that feels in service to an agenda? Maybe. But together, all these reviews help paint a picture. I actually think individual consumer reviews have a greater sense of bias within them. Additionally, consumer reviews often lack the experience to tell a full story. An “expert” from IGN on a video game comes from someone that plays a ton of games and recognizes the variety within them. A review from my friend Trent comes from someone who likes puzzle games, so I end up playing Uncharted and Tomb Raider for weeks. 

Regardless of information source or purpose, solely trusting a single source of truth is madness. Look for biases. Find supplemental sources. Lean into sources you trust. But use the collective information you have readily available, even the “experts.”</text>
