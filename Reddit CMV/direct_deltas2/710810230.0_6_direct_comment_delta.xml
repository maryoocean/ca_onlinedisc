    <title>CMV: High school literature and history courses fail to provide meaningful educational value</title>
    <original_poster>dabears_24</original_poster>
    <original_post>In their current form, high school courses focused on history and literature fail to provide meaningful educational benefits. 

These classes commonly have a goal of improving critical thinking skills and develop advanced literacy. However, the format of current history courses where students heavily analyze past events, does not emphasize critical thinking, but rather focuses on memorization of history that has little to no significance in the present. Literature classes that focus on deep analysis of *important* texts like Shakespeare's works, complex poetry, or stylistic writing (i.e. stream-of-consciousness in "Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man") do not develop readinc/writing skills applicable to students' lives or modern texts. They also tend to foster dislike for reading when students are forced to extract meaning from texts they do not value or understand.

I believe a courses in debate, critical analysis of nonfiction works (i.e. argumentative opinion pieces), or even literary analysis of more familiar works would all be better alternatives to detailed US history or general literature courses.

Since this is a broad statement with caveats, I'll clarify in a list:

- I am not arguing the classes offer zero value. The concept of being in an educational environment likely has benefits itself, so my view will not be changed by arguments of the form "all education has value".


- I acknowledge the value of basic history lessons in understand society, culture, and history that affects us today. I am arguing that there is little to no value in all students having to learn of details like specific battles of the Civil War, or the politics of the early 1800s. These topics should be pursed electively.


- I am not arguing that these classes lack value only because they do not tie to future careers. I believe these two courses majorly fail to provide value. I agree that math and science courses do not necessarily tie into future work, but I believe they accomplish their goals more effectively.

I admit I may display a STEM-favoring bias due to my field of study and work, so I am willing to accept arguments that show that my view is a function solely of my bias and not of reason.

EDIT: Want to clarify that I still think history should be taught at a general level in school. I don't think it should be as detailed or exhaustive as a part of the core curriculum. In other words, I think the necessary history can be taught in fewer total classes

EDIT 2: Pretty late in the cycle now, but I'll add this regardless since I've engaged with a lot of arguments that misinterpret my post. I am not arguing against the value of History and Literature. I am saying these classes are ineffective in their current forms</original_post>

    <text>I disagree a lot, kids should be reading much more literature than they are. I work with and go to school with (returning college student) recent HS grads. There are two main reasons I think they should be reading probably 2x the amount of literature they currently read. The first is that reading is a skill you don't really perfect until your late teens and your vocabulary improves markedly into your 20s. The more reading you do the more you are exposed to unique words and the more efficient you become. The second is that it is really hard to teach reading comprehension if you are not pushing people to read things that are just that much further out of their comfort zone. You can almost always spot a well-read individual, they listen well, they write well, they can be more empathetic, they understand subtext and connotation well, they have broad cultural understanding, and they are good conversationalists. It isn't a magic formula, make people read X amount of books and they will be X percent sophisticated, but I know that it is wholly more than we are doing now. 

 BTW, I am a STEM guy too, I have worked as an IT engineer for 14 years. It isn't a zero sum situation, I read constantly and mainly about things that aren't technology related. Believe me, many engineers I work with could use some remedial literature classes :-)</text>
