    <title>CMV: I believe in Death of the Author, but only for some forms of art</title>
    <original_poster>PeptideBond007</original_poster>
    <original_post>If you're not familiar with the Death of the Author concept, [here](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor) is a link that explains it (warning: TVTropes).

I have had many discussions with people about this theory in the past, and although none of them have convinced me to change my mind I am still open to the possibility. 

_____


**Where I believe Death of the Author applies:** physical art (sculpture/painting/drawing) and literature (poetry/prose). Since these forms of art are inherently more subjective, I think it makes a lot of sense to argue that the creator may be unconsciously channeling things outside of their original intention. Since all of these forms of art rely entirely on the creative vision of one person, any number of things in that person's personal history or life experiences can influence their work in ways they don't realize. I also think that works of art like these are distanced from their creators in ways that other art is not, and this distance allows for greater freedom of interpretation.

To give an example, Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* is often analyzed using the context of Shelley's own issues with her father. Shelley probably did not intend for this to influence her work and might not have agreed with some interpretations of the main character's oedipal tendencies. In my opinion, this does not make those interpretations wrong.

**Where I believe Death of the Author does not apply:** performance art (films/TV/theater). These forms of art are less subjective. They also function by a creative consensus between performers, directors, producers, etc., meaning that their vision and motivation has to be much more clearly defined. Performance art even comes with *documentation* of these motivations in the way of stage or script direction. In a book, if a character says "I'm sorry," it is up to the reader to interpret that character's motivations based on the rest of the text. In a performance, the line "I'm sorry" is often accompanied by directions in the script to indicate those motivations for the performers' benefit. Performance art is also much "closer" to the artist than physical art or literature is, so it cannot be decontextualized in the same way that those art forms can.

To give an example, television followings in the modern era of internet fandom are very eager to "ship" characters outside of the intentions of the director/screenwriter/performers. This sometimes goes as far as fans arguing that a character's sexuality is actually different than the creators say it is (e.g. that a straight character is actually gay or bisexual based on their own interpretation of the show). In my opinion, these interpretations are objectively wrong.

I suppose this CMV has two potential deltas â€“ either convince me that Death of the author applies to performance art or that it doesn't apply to physical art/literature. Change my view!

    <text>I guess it really depends on what you mean by the "author" of a performance piece. If you mean the screenwriter (which I think many people would), then it's trivially obvious that "Death of the Author" applies, and much faster than with books, because the Author is murdered by the production staff almost immediately :-). 

I would argue, though, that live performance is different. There can't be a *complete* DoA, because it is continually recreated. 

I think we'd have to accept DoA applies to films and TV and recorded music, because they live on long after the people who created it are gone, and a key part of DoA is that the *audience* takes on that role once the art is released. I think when you look at classic movies like The Godfather, Citizen Kane, etc., etc., it's pretty hard to argue that DoA doesn't apply. 

DoA isn't really about there being one vision vs. many (though many directors of films are *so* strong that I would argue that qualify even for the version you're talking about). 

It's about permanence vs. ephemerality. A piece of art that has separate existence from the author takes on a life of its own, and the interpretations of the audiences ultimately become the only thing that matters, because the author isn't there any more.

    <text>In the case of performance art, I would view each individual performance as a separate work. All of the people involved in making creative choices for the production are cumulatively the "author" in that case.</text>

    <text>Yeah, the key difference is that the audience's reaction is incorporated into every performance, inevitably. Thus the line between the two is blurred into indistinguishability.</text>

    <text>What do you think separates live performance from, say, watching a film in the theater? The way an audience is reacting to a film will change my impression of it in both cases.</text>

    <text>True, but there's no one there that can reasonably be considered an author, so the author's opinion on the matter is not really present outside of the static medium. 

There are exceptions, like Rocky Horror, but I'd call that a live performance, primarily. </text>

    <text>Well my argument is actually that the audience's interpretation/reaction doesn't change the meaning behind the work in the case of theater/movies in the same way that it does with literature. Theater is still essentially a static medium since most productions won't change direction mid-performance if the audience reacts differently than expected.</text>

    <text>I still don't really see the difference between a movie and a book, other than that the former has more people working on it. 

Even with books, the editor has a fairly strong influence on the book, so it's not like they have singular authors, either. 

I'm just saying that live performances have a very different dynamic... a complete change of direction in one show is not necessary for the author's visions continuing to be injected over time, intrinsically.</text>

    <text>I'm gonna paste what I said to /u/Mitoza for what I think the difference between a movie and a book is:
&amp;gt; I guess my thought is that in performance art, what's going on inside a character's head is much less subjective than in literature because there are multiple people dedicated to explicitly defining it. No one can ask Nick Carraway what he was thinking when he gazed admiringly at Jay Gatsby, but they can ask Tobey Maguire what his character was thinking when he gazed admiringly at Leonardo Dicaprio.</text>

Sure, but the whole point of Death of the Author is that it doesn't matter what he was thinking... only what the audience thinks about it. 

The existence of multiple authors doesn't change that in any substantial way, unless you're going to argue that classical music doesn't suffer from this and solo recordings do... </text>
