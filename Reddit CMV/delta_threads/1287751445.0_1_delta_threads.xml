    <title>CMV: American right wingers should support Russia/China/Iran against their own country.</title>
    <original_poster>Ion_12</original_poster>
    <original_post>I should start off by saying, I don’t really lump libertarians or NeoConservatives into the “right wing”.

When it comes to social “degeneracy” (LGBT rights, interracial relationship legality, feminism, etc), America is light years ahead of the rest of the world. Even America’s “right” party voted in support of these things. But, in countries like Russia, China, and Iran, these things are either illegal, or heavily frowned upon. 

The way America is set up, it is essentially impossible to turn the country into a right wing authoritarian state. If one wants something like that, they should support the other world powers to weaken America on the world stage, or support them to overthrow the American government, and promise full support if those countries are willing to put them in power.

It makes no sense for American “nationalists” to support their country at all.</original_post>

    <text>That certainly is true, but how do they not see the insanely difficult task of achieving this without outside help?</text>
