    <title>CMV: Album art that solely consists of a portrait photograph of the artist's or artists' face(s) without any interesting makeup is boring, lazy, and uninteresting.</title>

    <original_post>Examples: Phil Collins's [*Face Value*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c9/Phil_Collins_-_Face_Value.png/220px-Phil_Collins_-_Face_Value.png), [*No Jacket Required*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2f/Phil_Collins_-_No_Jacket_Required.png), [*...But Seriously*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f5/Phil_Collins-But_Seriously.jpg)


Taylor Swift's entire discography




Album art serves important functions- to draw a newcomer in and to be aesthetically pleasing. A good album cover ought to tantalize a listener and make them listen to the record.  It can  convey the tone and content of the album "loudly" with blunt and bold symbolism, or it can be mysterious and subtly hint at the content with a minimalist design.


 Additionally, it should be aesthetically appealing to some degree. This is important if you own a physical copy of the album, whether it be vinyl or cd, as it encourages you to preserve the quality of the casing. Additionally, it can be appreciated as you would appreciate any other piece of art. It also makes the band look more serious and professional about their work.



In my opinion, the portrait album covers I provided as examples have none of these qualities. First of all, they don't necessarily stick out. If it wasn't for Collins's and Swift's fame, these records could easily be passed over in a record store. They don't have any unique or noteworthy qualities to them- they're quite vanilla and inoffensive. It's just someone's face without any particular unique makeup or costume. Additionally, they're quite boring to look at. 


Secondly, it's hard to discern the tone and content of the album. Phil Collins seems to be donning a neutral expression in many of the album covers. This obviously makes it hard to determine what kind of music is going to be in the album.



I added the "makeup" caveat as it actually can make portrait covers interesting. Just look at Bowie's *Hunky Dory* and *Aladdin Sane*

Aesthetics and a listener's interpretation is highly subjective though. For instance, if I see an album cover with the artists face with no makeup, from an artist who generally doesn't do that, then that suggests to me that I'm looking at a more introspective album. The type of makeup may modify this.

However, they *are* famous. A famous face attracts attention *much* more than a generic attractive album art amidst a bunch of other similarly attractive album art.

That's where the laziness comes in. If you're famous, you don't have to think of anything creative- you can just use your face.</text>

    <text>If an album is your work and a representation of your thoughts and ideas, why not use your physical image to represent the album? If an album tells a story or has a deeper meaning, than I agree with you. But if an album is simply a person's outlet or their own personal expression, then I see nothing wrong with using their image on the cover.

We'll use the Phil Collins album *Face Value* as an example. The album is simply about his personal life and his own thoughts and feelings. He's presenting his feelings at "face value". I believe the cover fits that. It's his face, because *his* expression of *his* emotions in musical form. The cover being in black and white represents that his ideas are presented in black and white. He's not trying to color anything up, or try and dress up his ideas to make it more presentable. He wants to express himself as straightforward as he can.

Another example is Selena Gomez's album *Revival*. The cover is simply her, naked, in black and white. The album is meant to be a "naked" or "stripped down" version of her feelings. I'll admit while it's not overly creative and the idea for the cover can be considered overused, it still fits the entire point of the album, and fits it well. The same can be said for the Phil Collins album. 

I think an album cover is less about being creative and more about being representative of an album. Doing both of course speaks volumes about the artist(s), but if an album is a simplistic expression of the artist, then why can't the cover reflect that? </text>
