    <title>CMV: Most lesbians are butch (looking very masculine)</title>
    <original_poster>clavicle524</original_poster>
    <original_post>Many people consider it a negative stereotype that lesbians act very masculine or dress in a masculine way. I disagree. I believe most if not all lesbians are butch and there is no such thing as a lesbian who dresses very feminine. While a lesbian who dresses in a masculine way (short hair, traditional male clothing) and is feminine can exist, a lesbian who looks feminine (long, flowing hair, clear skin, a narrow waist, traditional female dress, and clothing, and little or no body hair or facial hair) does not exist. I’ve searched far and wide for lesbians who look very feminine but I couldn’t find anything. Just to let you guys know, I’m not saying being a butch lesbian or being masculine is bad. I’m merely stating why I believe the stereotype of Lesbians looking masculine is very true.

Edit: I've changed my view now thanks to the sources and the information people gave me. If you wish to challenge another aspect of my view, please read the delta log of my post first ([https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaLog/comments/1354bnm/deltas\_awarded\_in\_cmv\_most\_lesbians\_are\_butch/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaLog/comments/1354bnm/deltas_awarded_in_cmv_most_lesbians_are_butch/)) so you don't use the other arguments the other commentators used before.</original_post>

    <text>Have you ever heard of the toupee fallacy? Basically the idea goes that people think that all toupees look horrible and obvious. What they don't realize, is that they only notice toupees when they look obvious. No one notices a good toupee. So people's stereotypes about toupees are only based on bad toupees. Which are horrible and obvious.

You don't know the sexual orientation of everyone you meet. You only know you're meeting a lesbian when you're meeting an obviously butch lesbian. You don't notice all the femmes because they don't look like what your stereotype of a lesbian is. 

I'm a lesbian. Most days I look like any other straight woman, albeit a bit more goth. The only way you'd know I'm queer is info you need talk to me about my love life. That subject matter does not come up in most situations. This leads to most people I meet casually not knowing that I'm gay.

Autostraddle, a lesbian magazine, did a survey of their readers. The survey is mainly oriented around sex but they include femme vs butch as a question. Over 33% of the readers identified as unapologetically femme. Only 22% identified as definitely butch. The rest were somewhere in the middle.</text>
