    <title>Cmv: Losing your virginity as an adult and/or pursing/having sexual and romantic relationships as a grown adult is worthless and absolutely crummy and nothing to be happy or excited about compared to having the same experiences as a teenager</title>
    <original_poster>Ruka_ushibaru</original_poster>
    <original_post>I am a male virgin who will be a legal adult soon (18 years old)  

I have had some thoughts and concerns that have been lingering me for a while. 

As people know, teenagers have raging hormones and are easily aroused (especially teenage boys) 
But adults don't have the same raging hormones and sexual desires and drive that teenagers have. 

Adults also aren't innocent or ignorant to sex. Because of this, sex isn't as exciting or seen as something... to be mesmerised by. However teenagers on the other hand have a extremely strong desire to have sex and "explore"  

Because those experiences are new and mysterious they can be more exciting and thrilling especially because its it's something you shouldn't be doing unless you're older. 

I mean adults need all of these fucking sex enhancing drugs and techniques and information to improve their sex life and "spice" shit up. Adults also need to be "in the mood" for sex But adolescents don't need any of that bullshit.
Most are horny as shit and ready for sex all the time  

Also sex seems easier to find as a teenager because teens are around the same horny people of the same age all the time so it's easier to build relationships and find someone who is willing to have sex. 

Whenever teenagers display the desire for sex adults often chuckle and say oh Its just their raging hormones and "they're still so young"

All of this makes me absolutely angry and bitter because i never had the the opportunity to have sex as  teenager and now I'm out of high school and never will return, thus my chances of experiences sex as a teen are gone. 

I've been feeling extremely bitter as i said before and it's made me develop misogynistic views and some incel views as well. I'm not a misogynist or incel but If i continue this path i surely will become both of those things. 

With that being said, i am extremely ambitious, resilient and determined. I'm very hard working and have other qualities about myself that i am proud of. 
 
I have a lot of goals and desires i plan to purse. One of them being that i wanna become a person i am proud and confident to be. I wanna grow and learn and become successful. 

Some of my goals require me to social a lot. 
I plan to build my social skills further and learn to be more charismatic. 

I highly doubt i will ever find any sexual relationships with women when I'm older but... if i ever do why should i bother having sex with them?
If for one reason or another women find me attractive (money, or my success or some other quality i have) 

Why the fuck should i bother having sex and losing my virginity if i am a grown ass man? 

If beautiful women ever threw themselves at me should i be happy? Should i even play with their feelings and hurt them? 

Having Sex and relationships isn't exciting as a man compared to doing it as a boy. 

Worst of all, i feel even more bitter and angrier when i see stories of beautiful adult women having sex with teenage boys who are still in highschool. 

Thess stories make me feel inferior and frustrated that i will never have the same experiences. 

These boys are even considered lucky by most people including me. They're more lucky than adult men having sex the same women. 

I fucking hate sexually active teenagers, especially teenage boys who have sex with attractive adult women. 

I hate them. I hate them i hate them i hate them i. Fucking HATE them. 

If i am still a virgin by my 20s or even 30s I'd rather never have sex at all  

Also most people in America and other places lose their Virginities when they're still im highschool. 

Having sex as a grown adult for the first time means that you are late and other people who have had the same experiences at a younger age are superior and better and enjoyable for the reasons i mentioned before. 

Please change my view.</original_post>

Lmao, "As people know", bro you never heard of adults having all night orgies, swingers parties, one night stands, etc.? I can promise you that 20 and 30 year olds have just as many sexual desires as your inexperienced teenage ass. We just learned to control our boners.

&amp;gt;Adults also aren't innocent or ignorant to sex. Because of this, sex isn't as exciting or seen as something... to be mesmerised by. However teenagers on the other hand have a extremely strong desire to have sex and "explore" 

&amp;gt;Because those experiences are new and mysterious they can be more exciting and thrilling especially because its it's something you shouldn't be doing unless you're older. 

So something that's new is interesting? Groundbreaking work there. But what you fail to realize is that teens that have sex all the time also don't find it as mysterious.

&amp;gt;I mean adults need all of these fucking sex enhancing drugs and techniques and information to improve their sex life and "spice" shit up. Adults also need to be "in the mood" for sex But adolescents don't need any of that bullshit. Most are horny as shit and ready for sex all the time 

Lmao, "anyone trying new techniques to get better at a thing they like doing doesn't enjoy the vanilla version enough". I absolutely do not envy whoever you end up plowing missionary for 10 seconds before busting your first time. 

&amp;gt;I've been feeling extremely bitter as i said before and it's made me develop misogynistic views and some incel views as well. I'm not a misogynist or incel but If i continue this path i surely will become both of those things. 

Then don't continue? If you see the views as flawed and problematic, don't hold them?

&amp;gt;I have a lot of goals and desires i plan to purse. One of them being that i wanna become a person i am proud and confident to be. I wanna grow and learn and become successful. 

&amp;gt;Some of my goals require me to social a lot. I plan to build my social skills further and learn to be more charismatic. 

Alright, cool. That's a good start. But if you've not been very social up to this point, maybe recognize that your views are coming mainly from what you perceive, and not from reality. I know many people that lied about their sex lives as teens to be cool.

&amp;gt;I highly doubt i will ever find any sexual relationships with women when I'm older but... if i ever do why should i bother having sex with them? If for one reason or another women find me attractive (money, or my success or some other quality i have) 

&amp;gt;Why the fuck should i bother having sex and losing my virginity if i am a grown ass man? 

You're already shooting yourself in the foot with the whole "ill never be worthy of anyone" mentality. And you are altogether WAAAAYYYY too focused on the idea of sex and losing your virginity. It's not some mystical, otherworldly experience. It's an activity that can be amazingly fun for some, but not interesting for others (see 'asexual'). You don't need to do it if you don't want to; it's not something you "should" or "shouldn't" do.

&amp;gt;Having Sex and relationships isn't exciting as a man compared to doing it as a boy. 

Again, obviously the first time you do something it'll be more fun than the second or third. But how do you, a 17 year old, feel experienced enough to tell all us adults that we're wrong about finding our adult relationships fun and exciting?

&amp;gt;I fucking hate sexually active teenagers, especially teenage boys who have sex with attractive adult women. 

&amp;gt;I hate them. I hate them i hate them i hate them i. Fucking HATE them. 

Holy shit bro. I get that frustration, I really do. I wasn't cool or popular in high school and I was jealous of the athletic people for being fit and popular, but you have to let the hate go. It won't do anything but turn you into a bitter person. 

And I've seen you arguing with other comments, but just so you know, I have a friend who was really mentally messed up by an older woman preying on him when he was a teen. It started out fun for him, but it's been almost a decade and he's still not fully over it.

&amp;gt;Having sex as a grown adult for the first time means that you are late and other people who have had the same experiences at a younger age are superior and better and enjoyable for the reasons i mentioned before. 

You're straight up wrong. Your entire argument boils down to "adult sex is boring and teen sex is fun because i said so / everyone knows it is". You're making up these rules and saying everyone has them. I was on a rugby team in college and both the men's and women's teams could not care less who was a virgin or a slut or gay or straight. It really did not matter at all.

And fyi, because you said you didn't wanna become an incel, I'll tell you that this is exactly how it starts. A guy says "everyone is judging me for being a virgin", then uses that perceived judgment to justify to himself why he's pulling away from everyone and isolating himself in incel communities. Once he starts to develop the really shitty views like "I DESERVE sex", then people really do start judging him and he feels like he was right all along.</text>

    <text>Thank you for reading and responding to my post. 

Before i  reply to to the stuff you said i wanna bring up something else first. 

Another issue with being a adult male virgin is that women for some fucking reason detest male virgins. When they find out that a guy is a virgin they make fun of them and find it repulsive so they refuse to have sex with them. 

This is fucking bullshit. So whores want a man whos been with dozens of women before them?

This is why having sex as a teenager is absolutely vital and important because if youre a adult virgin a lot of women won't wanna have sex with you.</text>

    <text>That's... not true. Yes, there are some women (and men) that don't want to be someone's first, but that often revolves around many people feeling attached to the person who "took their virginity". But as I said, the rugby teams at my university had people who'd been with dozens, and people who were still virgins. We really didn't care. Hell, I didn't lose mine until 19, the summer after my first year in college. It's not at all strange to be a virgin for a year or two in college. 

&amp;gt;So whores want a man whos been with dozens of women before them?

Careful. You're sounding very much like an incel with that one. It might shock you, but the number of people someone's been with isn't a huge factor for a lot of people. A lot of the focus and perceived judgment on "virginity" is perpetuated by virgins and teenagers who are finding another way to antagonize their peers.


Cards on the table, I thought similarly to you when I was your age. Getting out of my small town and actually talking to other people helped me realize my unhealthy obsession with my idea of sex.

You're somewhat right that many people (men and women) will find a 40+ year old virgin a turnoff, but that doesn't apply to 18, 19, or early 20s virgins.

If you wanna talk about more specifics privately, feel free to message me privately, but I'll turn it around and ask you some questions.

What do you want to get out of sex? What do you think is the difference between having your first time as a 17 year old versus as a 19 year old? How many sexual partners would your preferred partner have? How many sex partners do you want to have before marriage (if you want to get married)?</text>
