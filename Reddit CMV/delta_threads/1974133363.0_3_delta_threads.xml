    <title>CMV: Westerners should be deeply worried by our nations' inefficiency when building infrastructure</title>
    <original_poster>Real_Carl_Ramirez</original_poster>
    <original_post>I was recently watching this video: [The Â£100BN Railway Dividing a Nation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSD5ps9bLQ0) (it is about extreme delays and cost blowouts with the UK's HSR2 project). Similarly in the USA, the [California High-Speed Rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_High-Speed_Rail) also has extreme delays and cost blowouts.

It reminds me of what I've seen here in Australia:

* In Sydney, the [CBD and South East Light Rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBD_and_South_East_Light_Rail) was [delayed by over a year](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8102513/Sydneys-light-rail-faces-delay-troubled-project-set-held-back.html) and had [a 1.2 billion AUD cost blowout](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-07/light-rail-contractor-sues-nsw-government/9629948).
* In Adelaide, the mere electrification of the [Gawler railway line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawler_railway_line) [cost 900 million AUD and was delayed by almost 2 years](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-04-02/free-substitute-buses-for-adelaides-gawler-train-line/100961484).
* Nationwide, the [NBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network) had a cost blowout, costing [51 billion AUD](https://archive.ph/jL764) instead of the [original forecast of 29.5 billion AUD](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-13/federal-election-nbn-promises-past-and-present/7506714). Keep in mind that this is the cheaper, slower version of the NBN instead of the original version, and thus [Australia ranks #56 in internet speeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Internet_connection_speeds), behind even highly-censored nations like Russia, Saudi Arabia and the PRC.

Before you tell me "*that's because your country is corrupt*", that doesn't make it any less worrying. If western nations constantly face cost blowouts and delays with infrastructure projects, how can we possibly have hope that we can enjoy fast internet in the future? Or clear up transport problems? Or build the infrastructure needed for sustainable development? 

There's a reason why more countries support the PRC's [territorial claims](https://thediplomat.com/2016/07/who-supports-china-in-the-south-china-sea-and-why/) and [policies against Uyghurs](https://archive.ph/wip/8QMbX) than oppose them. Namely, it's because the PRC has been able to buy the loyalty of nations because it's well-known for quickly and cost-effectively building infrastructure for them. I don't want to shill for the PRC here, but Western countries' inefficiency when building infrastructure makes it harder for us to buy the loyalty of nations with this trick.

It's not like western nations are inherently incapable of efficiently building infrastructure (which is another reason why this recent trend of extreme delays and cost blowouts should be worrying):

* Australia's Snowy Mountains Scheme cost the equivalent of [6 billion AUD](https://web.archive.org/web/20060919222034/http://www.ministers.dotars.gov.au/ja/pressconf/2004/APC9_2004.htm)
* The USA's lunar landing effort cost the equivalent of [280 billion USD](https://www.planetary.org/space-policy/cost-of-apollo)
* The Channel Tunnel linking the UK to France cost the equivalent of [12 billion GBP](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/france/articles/channel-tunnel-facts/)</original_post>

    <text>I mean if we had an army of disposable people willing to work for $2 an hour. We'd likely be just as efficient. But we have to deal with these pesky things called safety regulations and worker rights. 

It's not really that much of a concern. If those projects were critical to our survival. We'd get it done with flying colors. We just don't really put that much emphasis on that stuff. 

Also... it's government what do you expect. If you wanted this stuff done right you'd let a few private companies compete on the project.</text>

I am strongly in support of safety regulations and worker rights. But if our inefficiency in building infrastructure is solely due to safety regulations and worker rights, that's very unfortunate. It would discredit the very concept of safety regulations and worker rights, not to mention give credence to the politicians who oppose these.</text>

    <text>It's part of the reason. There is a large myriad of reasons.

But if you're specifically comparing us to countries like China. I'd be very careful doing that. Their labor rights have come a long way in the last 20 years but they are still nowhere near the western standard.

In the simplest terms 1000 people getting paid $2 an hour is 5 times cheaper than 1000 people getting paid $10 an hour. All of that adds up very quickly.</text>

    <text>But even despite that, western nations make detailed cost estimates to outline expected costs, taking our higher labour costs into account. If we are regularly breaching such meticulously calculated estimates, either our estimation system is wrong, or we have some serious problem making us inefficient at building infrastructure.</text>

    <text>Sounds like poor estimates. What makes you think they were "meticulously calculated". They may have been low balling on purpose to get it approved. Knowing that it's a lot easier to ask for more $ than to get a project approved.

Fundamentally government has a very inefficient incentive structure. The goal is to get elected. Not necessarily produce a product in an efficient manner that delivers quantitative results.</text>
