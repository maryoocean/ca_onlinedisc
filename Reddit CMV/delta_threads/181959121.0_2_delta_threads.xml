    <title>CMV: Celebrity AMAs are ruined by Victoria from Reddit</title>

    <original_post>**EDIT: [Please read this from the /r/IAmA  mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/30ea3g/mod_post_riama_misconceptions/)**

----

I have no problem with Victoria herself, just the concept of "Victoria from reddit is here helping me out".

To me the entire point of an AMA is having someone of note interact
with this unpredictable medium.  Ask Me **Anything**.  It's fun and interesting to see them negotiate the comments, with the potential for them to be reading the most bizarre and funny points of view, with strange interactions on lower voted comments as well as random replies to far reaching child-comments.

Victoria from Reddit turns the medium into yet another "send in your questions and we'll pick the best to ask this person who is so much better than you".  Instead of interacting directly with someone, there's a filter.  A filter who types the same way in every AMA, using *italics* and -laughs- and -umms- which completely takes away from it for me.

Here Victoria says that the Woody Harelson AMA would have turned out differently:  https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fgsv2/i_am_victoria_from_reddit_amaa/ck91rpw  Which shows that comments are being filtered.  That is what made AMAs so great, it's a celeb being talked to directly, and this is more often POSITIVE rather than that negative example.

In essence I think Victoria turns it into a basic interview with fan questions that has been done a million times before.  If a brand wants to promote via AMA, jump in and get dirty.   I don't even read AMAs anymore if it's got Victoria doing the typing.

If there's a better way of looking at this , please CMV, I want to enjoy AMAs again without the frustration.

-----
Reason for view change:

I still dislike AMAs with Victoria, and am clearly not the only one.  This comes from Victoria creating a difference between the celebs and us average Joes.  Of course this isn't always the case.  As it turns out, Victoria will help anyone that fits in her schedule.  So in reality it is just some AMAs (Ludacris as a recent example) that may turn out far more interesting if they had to navigate the website themselves in exchange for publicity.

With a few people commenting with first hand experience, I've decided that because the benefits of Victoria are more heavily weighted by the majority, my post title view has been changed.  Even if I'm stuck hating the AMAs, Victoria doesn't "ruin" them.

Thanks for all the replies!

    <text>I think you have to ask yourself if the Victoria-assisted AMAs are better than NO AMAs. Someone that knows Reddit (Zach Braff, etc) will just do an AMA on their own no sweat, so Victoria is adding value by getting interviews we wouldn't get otherwise.

It's harder for other folks - remember how Stephen Colbert just answered 10 questions from a thread? There was no interactivity at all.

It sounds to me like you like a particular type of AMA so much that you *dislike* any other kind of AMA, and that you want celesbs reading random comments. I think the celebs might disagree with you there - they get plenty of crazy as part of their regular life, and don't owe you anything.</text>

    <text>Celebs who are doing AMAs in order to promote, which is 99% of those going through Victoria, I think they do owe the askers and readers something.</text>

    <text>Engagement with a community platform they're using to advertise on.  I just dislike the way AMAs are used as another stop on the press tour and Victoria makes that even more so the case.

If you want thousands of people on a website not made to be your soapbox to see the link to your new film, give something back.</text>

    <text>They don't owe you anything.  They're letting you ask them any question for free.

You're not entitled to something "juicy".  If you don't like an AMA, don't upvote it.  The ones where the celebrity gives more than expected tend to be more highly upvoted.

    <text>The simple question is this:

Do you want celebrity AMAs to be a stage managed, highly controlled and pre-arranged event like every other form of promotional event, or do you want it to be more volatile and out of control of the PR reps? 

Clearly the USP of a celebrity AMA has always been you are talking directly to the celebrity over the internet and you're not being vetted by the personal handlers of the celebrity. With Victoria, that USP at best becomes doubtful, and at worst becomes nonexistent.

If you're happy with it being another stage managed promo event where the questions are tame and everything goes the celebrities way then that is fine, but in that case you shouldn't be under any illusions that the celebrity is the principle benefactor in the AMA. And they should probably change the meaning of the acronym to Advertise Me Anything.  </text>

    <text>That's it.  I don't know why I didn't say something like that, "you are talking directly to the celebrity".  It really is that simple.  

This took away fence siting this thread had given me and I think that cements my view as unchanged.  Wish that I could count that as a delta for you.</text>

    <text>Well - you're wrong. 

I've personally sat in on the calls Victoria does with celebs for AMAs, and I can guarantee you she asks every question she can get to, and she types out responses - completed unfiltered, with tone and inflection included the best she can. She doesn't avoid the hard-hitting questions, and she doesn't skip over things she doesn't want answered. She starts by sorting by "new" and gets to those questions first. Then, midway through, she usually switches to "best" to make sure top-rated comments are getting responses, too.

No one captures tone and inflection like Victoria, and you are still talking directly to the celebs. Sure, they don't always see your username - but there is absolutely nothing lost between you and the celeb if Victoria is involved.</text>
