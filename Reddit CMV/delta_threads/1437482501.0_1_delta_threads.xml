    <title>CMV: Kink and BDSM should not be at public pride events and should be kept for 18+ ones</title>
    <original_poster>akoudagawaismywaifu</original_poster>
    <original_post>To start, I am a lesbian. And I've been seeing recent controversy about this topic. 

Look, no denying that kink plays a big role in the creation of pride. It is a part of embracing sexuality and shouldn't be excluded from the community. 

However, it should not be at public pride parades. Pride should be for everyone of all ages. Many people say "stop catering to the straight capitalized ideal of what pride should be" and "pride isn't a party, it's a protest don't police us" and "children should go to disney if they want family friendly" This has nothing to do with straight rainbow capitalism. I figured out I was LGBT at age 11 and trust me if I saw a kink act in public I would be kind of disgusted. I'm still a minor now, and I'd be less disgusted but still. I know people say that it's up to you to bring your children to pride, but by making all pride events "wear whatever you want even if it's nothing" we are also kinda excluding minors from it. It's also non consensual to anyone who is exposed to such acts, because nobody wants to go to pride to see naked people right? The "think of the children" phrase holds true here. Young children and teens embracing their sexuality shouldn't be forced to see adult acts against their will. 

Again, no denying the role kink plays in the community, but it should be kept at 18+ events. There should definitely be a separate pride for people who just want to do leather and other kinks. That way, you can do whatever you want in a safe space where you know you won't offend others, and because people consented to come to an 18+ event, it's all good. 

That's just my personal opinion on it, but it seems to be the minority. I'd like to see how you guys think about this.

Edit: it appears after reading and responding to several comments, I don't really have a problem with kink, but more with public indecency. I don't care if you wear a collar or leather pants. But I'd rather not see things that could get you arrested or questioned for doing in public.</original_post>

    <text>Can you be more specific about where you want to draw the line? "Kink" and even "BDSM" are pretty broad terms. I can certainly imagine demonstrations that would cross the line, but is say someone merely wearing a leather collar at pride inappropriate to you?</text>

    <text>If what you’re wearing would get you arrested or at least questioned if you weren’t at a pride parade... that’s probably a good start for a line.

If I wasn’t at pride and walked around in public with only some leather bondage straps, i’d most certainly have some questions asked about public indecency.</text>

    <text>Basically what you said. I don't care if you wear a collar or if you're a dude who's topless and wearing a leather vest. But if it's generally considered indecent in public, yeah</text>

    <text>It sounds like you don't actually have a problem with "kink," just explicit nudity...</text>

    <text>I suppose so, though many kink acts do revolve around nudity or minimal clothing to an extent</text>

    <text>So again, it’s about the indecency rather than the kink.</text>
