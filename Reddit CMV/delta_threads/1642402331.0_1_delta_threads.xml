    <title>CMV: The onus of sustainability is excessively placed on consumers and the obligation should instead be placed on corporations.</title>
    <original_poster>Fluffy_Owl4316</original_poster>
    <original_post>Much of the media we read today about sustainability is focused on what consumers should be doing to move the needle. This includes things such as recycling food containers, composting food scraps, repairing and reusing clothing rather than purchasing new, etc. As corporations continue to produce these items, the proper disposal and thus environmental impact, is placed on the consumer. 

On the other hand, corporations are publishing lofty goals about recycled materials and reduced carbon footprint by 2050 or other far-off timeframes. Yet, there is little regulation to ensure that these goals are achieved. There isn’t a single governing body which is responsible for measuring the attainment of these statements, which doesn’t hinder the goodwill of creating the goals, but does little to hold corporations accountable for achieving them. 

At the end of the day, large corporations are responsible for much of the waste which harms the environment and should have a greater obligation and more enforcement of sustainable methods and materials. While end users are also responsible, humans fall victim to common errors and shortcomings which make true environmental impact, one that moves the needle, nearly impossible for individual users, even collectively as compared to large businesses. While the responsibility for sustainability and carbon footprint is often targeted towards consumers, the narrative should instead be on large corporations and how to hold them accountable to finding sustainable solutions.</original_post>

    <text>The problem with putting the obligation solely on corporations is that they have no incentives to do become sustainable. Sustainable practices are usually more expensive, more time consuming, and far less convenient. Corporations that are big enough to fit within your ideal responsible party are only that big because they save every penny and have streamlined their business based on profit, which sustainable practice don't work with.

Sustainability is extremely inconvenient, or at least, too inconvenient for the general mass to bother with, so any corporation trying to fill the sustainable market will fail to reach most people. Businesses *need* the support of the people to survive. They wouldn't be able to maintain supplying *our* unsustainable lifestyles while themselves being sustainable.

The assumption that corporations should be the ones to assume responsibility for changing the world into more sustainable practices takes the accountability from the unsustainable lifestyles consumers lead, which are the root cause of the business practices you seek to change. In truth, both parties need to change face to make any reasonable difference


Edit: My view opposing the OP has been changed through conversation. The way I now see it: on an individual level, it's important for each person to take an interest in sustainability and how it benefits them, as this interest will allow businesses and policy to alter their course. The actual responsibility for the change however, rests on the shoulders of corporations and the government</text>

    <text>Interesting thought - it seems like you're saying that it is still on consumers to make the change, but in a different way. Not only should we be consuming and recycling/reusing more responsibly, but we should also be more vocal about what we want from companies in order to push the change legislatively. I like that perspective!</text>

    <text>Each person being an advocate is a big part of it, but the buying power usually has more influence on the market that being vocal. We've seen many times big companies shrug off scandals when people outcry for justice but still make their bottom line from customers.

Consumers who feel morally invested in sustainability are more likely to support and buy from businesses also interested in sustainability.

In architecture, basically every architect is interested is sustainable design, but sustainable buildings only get built for clients willing to pay for it. Same idea here</text>
