    <title>CMV: The "no one is illegal" response is unjustified virtue signaling and the term "undocumented immigrant" is misleading.</title>
    <original_poster>snogo</original_poster>
    <original_post>I understand that there are sensitivities that need to be taken when referring to people who built their entire lives around an illegal act, but nobody cares when we characterize other people as "illegal" due to other illegal acts.

If I illegally dump toxic waste in the local river, I may very well be referred to as an illegal dumper. If I illegally sell cigarettes in the park, I may very well be referred to as an illegal seller. If I illegally grow marijuana in a legal state where a distinction is necessary, I may very well be referred to as an illegal grower.

The only time referring to someone as an "illegal X" gets people riled up is when you are referring to people who immigrated illegally.

This leads to whitewashed terms like "undocumented immigrant" which sounds like there was no illegal act performed. The term "undocumented immigrant" sounds to the uninformed observer like someone who is just like any other legal immigrant but whose immigration was undocumented due to a mishap in paperwork.

It wasn't simply an "undocumented immigration", it was an unauthorized, or illegal immigration.

The fact is that these are not terms that people actually use with any real frequency to refer to people who commit these crimes. The only one that is used with any frequency is "illegal dumper" and even this appears in only 13,600 Google search results compared with over three million for "illegal immigrant." The terms "illegal seller" and "illegal grower" are even less common, and appear to refer almost exclusively to corporations (which can, in fact, be illegal), not natural persons (who can't).

&amp;gt;This leads to whitewashed terms like "undocumented immigrant" which sounds like there was no illegal act performed. 

"Undocumented immigrant" is a parallel term to things like "unlicensed doctor" (a term people actually use with millions of Google search results), "unlicensed lawyer," "unauthorized seller" (which, from Google search results, is an order-of-magnitude more common than "illegal seller"), "unlicensed gun owner," etc. We don't call any of those people illegal, and it's completely consistent to follow the same convention by not calling undocumented immigrants illegal.</text>

Those terms seem to pop up commonly enough compared to how much those groups are discussed online. If the EPA refers to people who dump toxic waste illegally as "illegal dumpers" and so on for the rest of the examples when they were just examples that I came up with off the top of my head, that is enough for me. 

Accordingly, the term "unauthorized immigrant" is an equivalent term to "illegal immigrant" in my book just as the term "unauthorized dumper" is equivalent to "illegal dumper". I don't think that one term popping up more frequently, even orders of magnitude more frequently implies any malice in the use of the term "illegal immigrant".

I would like to challenge this assertion. The term "undocumented immigrant" gives no indication of the nature of the immigration of that individual unlike the term "unauthorized immigrant". 

If you referred to unauthorized individuals as a group, you would only be referring to people who immigrated without authorization which is against the law (illegal). It is very clear what you are talking about. 

When you refer to undocumented immigrants as a group, you are referring to any immigrants who have not yet received or misplaced their documents as well as unauthorized immigrants who do not have documents by default.

    <text>Do you also object to the term "unlicensed doctor" on the same basis? After all, it gives no indication to the nature of the medicine that individual is practicing unlike "unauthorized doctor." Do you think that the term "unlicensed doctors" refers to any doctors, legal or illegal, who have not yet received or have misplaced their licenses?</text>
