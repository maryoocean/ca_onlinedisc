    <title>CMV: Marriage is not hard work</title>
    <original_poster>Lorenzo_Brandy</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have been married for five years. We have one child together. We rarely argue and never fight. I don't feel like this is the result of the kind of concerted effort that certain people state is necessary for maintaining a marriage. Rather, we were very much in love from the outset and have therefore cultivated habits of being together easily. We also have put our marriage at the center of our lives (as opposed to, say, careers), which we were more than happy to do. We of course have had hard times, but neither of us have had rhe sense that these threatened the marriage in any way. It seems like a popular trope that marriage is hard, sometimes unpleasant endeavor and I get a little bent out of shape about it because it's not descriptive of my experience and I feel like it doesn't have to be that way.</original_post>

So it sounds like you're saying marriage does take sacrifice (what you could be doing in your career) but you're happy to make that sacrifice because of love. 

Would you say marriage doesn't take effort? Or that the effort isn't so unpleasant or tedious that you'd call it work? </text>

    <text>I'd definitely say the latter. </text>

    <text>So isn't it entirely possible that marriage is hard work but you just enjoy doing it to the point that you don't see it?

Woodworking is hard work, but to those who are in love with the profession it may not seem that way.</text>
