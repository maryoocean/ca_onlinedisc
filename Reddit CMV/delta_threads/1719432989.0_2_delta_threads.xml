    <title>CMV: Adding rape as a legal punishment would be good for society.</title>
    <original_poster>kimagical</original_poster>
    <original_post>This started off as a showerthought but I couldn't find any reason this isn't legit, so here we go.

We need to add rape to the legal system as a viable additional punishment for heinous crimes.

I know what you're thinking. But it's not an unsually cruel punishment.

We already have the death sentence, and if not that, then life sentences of solitary confinement, which virtually all experts-- including official statements from the United Nations-- agree is torture.

And if you're a prisoner today, sometimes you are *already* getting raped. Other times you go "gay for the stay".

So don't tell me adding rape as a legal punishment is anything unusually cruel or sinking lower morally.

If anything, this would help guards regulate "safer" condom-provided prison rape, like how weed became regulated and safer after it was legalized in Canada.

So it's not much of a negative. But why is it a positive?

Here's why: there's a rapidly rising population of involuntary celibates. In the last 10 years alone, the population of these "incels" doubled from 12% of the young male population to 24%.

This is 45,000 incels ballooning to over 100,000. These incels have been behind an alarming number of mass murder sprees.

Every day incels on the dark web discuss organizing terrorism.

There's no fancy peer-reviewed study on that last bit yet-- but I've seen this happening with my own eyes by digging around social media years ago.

I found massive and highly active online communities who worship Elliot Roger and egg each other on to muster up the courage to flatten people with trucks. Buy automatic weapons and kill.

If the population is given free license on their own time to rape any inmates who have been handed the punishment of rape, this could solve some of the incel problem.

It *may* not help; obviously there's no proof in this area. It would be a moral wild west, but there's no time to wait. Innocent people are being shot to death.

It would be far more immoral to not at least try this preventative measure when there are innocents being murdered.

This availability of prison sex slaves with no bodily rights would also directly compete with street prostitution, lowering the demand for a dangerous and morally questionable industry, at best saving two birds with one nest.

At worst, we realize it's not helping and we revert the program. My view is that there is enough reason to try it.</original_post>

    <text>Based on your description of incels which I think is accurate, they are clearly immoral menaces to society. Why should we appease them instead of putting them in jail?</text>

    <text>Because we can't arrest them before they expose themselves by committing a crime in the open. Usually when a mass killing by incel happens we have no idea it was an organized, announced intent fueled by incel communities until the police go into their house and hack into their computer history.

I'd sooner appease sex-crazed people if it prevents a mass shooting than let more innocent people die because I insist on giving even the worst criminals the right to bodily autonomy; especially when we're already taking away most of their rights already anyway.</text>

    <text>How about fanatical racists whose only desire is to hurt and kill those they hate? Should we turn in a Black or Chinese petty thief to the KKK because they threaten to blow up a building? What would the world look like if good people give in to the demands of psychopaths?

Justice dictates we can’t put someone in jail before he commits a crime. Unfortunately, this also means innocent people have been harmed. But severe punishment will always be a much more effective deterrent than appeasement. Look at how drastically acts of terror have declined since the world collectively bombed the shit out of ISIS and sent all their leaders behind bars or to the grave. Somehow I don’t think this outcome would have occured had we allowed them to take over the Middle East.</text>
