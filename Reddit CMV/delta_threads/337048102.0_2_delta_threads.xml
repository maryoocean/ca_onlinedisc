    <title>CMV: Some people want companies to pay a carbon tax, others do not. I believe the best compromise is an optional carbon tax.</title>
    <original_poster>antilisterine</original_poster>
    <original_post>There are people who care about climate change who want companies to pay a carbon tax - well they can pressure companies to prove that they're environmentally friendly and they can do that by paying the optional carbon tax. It's like they're saying, hey, we care so much about the environment, that we're willing to pay a tax that we don't even have to pay.

However those who don't care about climate change can remain unaffected by it - they can buy products and use services from companies that refused to pay the optional carbon tax. Also, as I've mentioned before, I don't believe that disadvantaged people should be forced to thank society for treating them like shit or be forced to help people with good lives whilst their lives are miserable - in this scenario, they have a choice. These people can choose not to support companies that pay the optional carbon tax so that way they're not thanking society, they're not helping people with good lives and they can remain completely unaffected by it.

It just seems like a win-win situation to me. So why can't we fight for an optional carbon tax instead? I see literally no problems with it.

    <text>The whole point of a carbon tax is to take away or at least shift that choice from the complacent and slow market.

It and similar schemes can only work of the damage to the environment is factored in as a unavoidable cost and tradeoff that raises prices. Desperate or greedy people won't care if its optional, so you don't give them that choice.

All the optional tax will achieve is to give piece of mind to the people that buy alternate more expensive products or lessen their consumption. But thats not the objective of the tax, the objective is to lessen the environmental effects.
So it has to affect everyone in order to force the companies to either change or make the product more expensive so people buy less of it.</text>

    <text>My point is that if companies have a choice, then we will still have the same outcome anyway. Desperate and greedy people will care once their profits are hurt which will happen when more people care about climate change and decide to support renewables. This will help to protect the environment.</text>

As in sometime in the future or never.
And with desperate and greedy people i also meant the customers, not only the companies.
A full carbon tax grips now, regardless of a opinion shift that may never come.

In the end the majority is selfish and buys the stuff from walmart instead of the fairtrade, eco freindly, more expensive products from other shops. I dont think that will ever change unless you take away that option or at least make it less preferable.
