    <title>CMV: It's stupid to care about the environment in space.</title>
    <original_poster>MostRecommendation84</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm a big proponent of space colonization/exploitation and every time I bring it up there's someone who says something along the lines of "Oh we're gonna trash the Moon like we did Earth?" "Oh good more mining!" "Humanity won't rest until we've exploited everything we can!" and other snide comments to that effect. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Honestly, it just sounds like the dumbest argument to me and I wouldn't even be bothering with a CMV if I hadn't heard it so many times. *It's rocks. Uninhabitable barren rocks floating through vast chunks of literally* ***nothing****.* There's no space squirrels to worry about, we haven't found any aliens and we really have no reason to assume any are out there, let alone that they give a shit what we do to Mercury. Furthermore, you want to stop desertification or the human rights violations of cobalt mining, you're gonna be hard pressed to find a better solution than the absurd volumes of water and cobalt from here to the asteroid belt.</original_post>

    <text>You realize that leaving actual garbage floating around in space presents a serious navigation hazard, right?

There have been actual satellites that have been knocked out after getting struck by debris that was discarded from other launches/missions.</text>

    <text>Do you mean actually out in space or just in our orbit? The crap in our orbit is a problem, but also if we manage to setup infrastructure to start exploiting space there's legitimately no reason we can't start gathering up junk in general and start chucking it in any random direction and letting inertia take care of the rest. Or throw it into the sun if we're worried it'll hit a space marmot in 90,000 years.</text>

That's...not how orbits work.

If you just throw something in a random direction, it will be in approximately the orbit you were, and it will pass through (roughly) the same place relative to the body it's orbiting repeatedly. The more we do that, the more we increase the probability of colliding with something near the bodies we visit frequently.

If you actually want to make it not a problem, you need to throw it out of the solar system, which takes a *lot* of energy. It's easier the further out you are, but even if you're near Jupiter's orbit, you still need to throw things at about 5 km/s to get them to leave the solar system.

Throwing it into the sun is actually even *harder*. To throw things out of the solar system you need to increase their velocity by about 40% of your current velocity around the sun....to throw them *into* the sun you need to decrease their velocity by more than half of its current velocity around the sun. And increasing and decreasing velocities are equally difficult in space.

In short "throw it into the sun" and "chuck it into space so that we'll never need to worry about it" are both *much* more expensive than more traditional waste management.</text>
