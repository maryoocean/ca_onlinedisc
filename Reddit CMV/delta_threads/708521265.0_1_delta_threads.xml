    <title>CMV: Chromium should be the reference web browser implementation and maintained by an independent, non-profit organization.</title>

    <original_post>Warning: this is a bit technical and long-winded and you may not actually care.

&amp;lt;background&amp;gt;

The [web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) is built on a set of [standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_standards) that determine how web sites &amp;amp; apps are created, how they should be displayed, and how they should behave. Several organizations maintain and create these standards, like the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/), [Ecma International](https://www.ecma-international.org/default.htm), and many more (mostly with terrible websites).

The basic idea is that through these standards bodies, companies (Google, Microsoft, Apple), non-profits (Mozilla), and other internet stakeholders can come together and agree on some rules, recommendations, and conventions. Developers follow these standards when creating apps and websites. In turn, browsers agree to honor the standards. This is how you can create an app once and know that it's the same on all the latest browsers.

Except that last statement **isn't true**. Even a casual person on the web will know that [certain sites](https://twitter.com/AirbnbHelp/status/752829250198245376) just look weird on certain browsers. Weird bugs will pop up or some apps just don't work on browsers with a smaller market share. Some websites will even block specific browsers.

A lot of websites today are [built only for Chrome](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards), and Firefox/Edge/Safari users can count themselves lucky if, by sheer luck, a website also works on their obscure browser. Google Chrome's [dominance](http://gs.statcounter.com/) (63% market share) and [other](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/about) [factors](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdge/blob/master/README.md) mean that this will probably only grow worse in the future. Many [feel that this threatens](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/12/06/goodbye-edge/) the open standards that the web is built on, as Google builds its own set of standards and becomes the ultimate gatekeeper to our online lives.

Standards can never cover all the bases. Each [browser engine](https://gizmodo.com/which-browser-engine-powers-your-web-browsing-and-why-d-1833935288) implements standards [differently](https://caniuse.com/), with just enough minor differences to matter. They don't always do it at the same pace, their users don't update at the same pace, and they sometimes add features that aren't even standard yet. So developers are left to adapt--to patch the gaps and create workarounds, or (as more and more are doing) just give up and assume their users are using Chromium (Chrome's engine) or block those that aren't.

&amp;lt;/background&amp;gt;

Many feel that the solution is for more browsers--or actually, more browser *engines*, with a healthier market share for each (basically, *more competition*). This will force developers to build for the whole internet, not just for Chrome. I think this is a pipe dream at this point.

My position: there should be a **reference implementation** of a web browser that is actively maintained by a single independent, non-profit organization with members from many different stakeholders. Developers should test their sites on this reference. Actual browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) can add their own specific app features like a Download Manager, Extensions, Reading mode--anything that's not rendering the page. They can even deviate from the reference, but they must do so knowing that the reference stays the reference.

As things currently stand, the standards leave too much for browser vendors to decide. There are entire libraries devoted to solving the issue of incompatibility between browsers, and they haven't succeeded. This should not be the case. Competition is good, but it should be based on merit, not on how entrenched something is. As a user, I want to choose my browser based on its **features**, and I should just be able to assume that it can do the basic job of rendering a web page correctly, and (perhaps more important) consistently.

Edit: Added a final section I left out earlier, plus some additional clarification.</original_post>

What makes a chromium fork any better as a standard than whatever the W3C is putting out?  Do you think that this new non-profit is going to be magically more agile than W3C or going to make better decisions?

There was a time when every website was built for Netscape Navigator.  Then it was Internet Explorer. And, for what it's worth, we seem to be heading into a world where everything is "optimized for mobile."</text>

    <text>That xkcd is referring to the case where a completely *new* implementation is created to replace old ones. What I'm proposing is that they produce something that's at a lower level of abstraction. It's much easier to test against an implementation than against a high-level document.

&amp;gt;Do you think that this new non-profit is going to be magically more agile than W3C or going to make better decisions?

No, but it will make *a single decision.* Right now, developers are forced to deal with every decision that every browser vendor makes. When Google decides to put outlines around all their buttons, designers need to deal with that. When Firefox takes a long time to implement a new feature in Javascript, developers need to create workarounds. Meanwhile, the stakes today are much higher, on a scale incomparable to the days of Netscape and Internet Explorer.

&amp;gt;we seem to be heading into a world where everything is "optimized for mobile."

This just means developers now have even more things to keep on top of:

1. Different (often dynamic) screen sizes and orientation
2. Low-end devices
3. Unreliable network connections
4. **Browser incompatibility**

\--in my opinion, this just makes it more important than ever to smooth the way for developers. Browser engines *should* be more consistent. Like compilers for native apps and vanilla ice cream, they are a keystone for the modern web. It's about time they started acting like it.</text>

    <text>So, there are two pieces to this.  There's the "web browser developer" piece and the "web site developer" piece.

From the web site developer's perspective, introducing a new "reference implementation" isn't particularly helpful.   You're still looking at the same ecosystem of web browsers (or maybe the same ecosystem plus one.)  I still occasionally look at stuff using lynx.  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28web_browser%29 )   Is this "reference implementation" supposed to convince me to stop doing that?   Alternatively, web developers who feel like they can dictate which browsers their clients use, are already doing that.   Tracking cross-compatability in some systematic fashion would be a mess.

For the web browser developer the situation is much the same.  The ecosystem of web site developers is just as if not more uncontrolled than the system of web browsers, and there are legacy websites with propriety and browser-specific implementations.  So you could build a "reference implementation compatible" browser, but that doesn't guarantee that it will work well with existing web sites.

In addition to the effects of simple entropy, the web is full of people trying to play the "embrace, extend, and extinguish" game.  As long as businesses have incentives to play that kind of game and there's no compelling reason for people to move away from legacy systems the ecosystem will continue to be fractured.   There are benefits to be had from a regulated web, but to make that happen you would need a whole lot more than a non-profit with a reference implementation.  It would require some kind of system involving certification and enforcement authority.</text>
