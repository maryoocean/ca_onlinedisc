    <title>CMV: ALL drugs should be legalized. (x-post from r/unpopularopinion)</title>
    <original_poster>conjo434</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm opened to changing my mind about drugs that can make people hurt other people (i.e. Amphetamines, PCP). But apart of these, ALL drugs (including heroin, cocaine, LSD, etc.) should be 100% legal to buy and use, and with strong regulation on production and sell (i.e. the government can choose to not give out licences to produce and/or sell specific drugs, but is refrained from prosecuting users in anyway, unless they harmed someone else).

Two main reasons for my opinion on the matter:

1. Humans should have complete freedom in regards to THEIR OWN body. If someone wants to use any substance, it's their right, and their responsibility if they fuck their lives in the process. It's a basic principal for me. "But hey, we as a society will have to bear the costs of those dangerous choices!" - well, yeah, same as we have to do it for people who chose to do extreme sports, and nobody suggests to prohibit those. We should put emphasis on education (and open up to using drugs as a way to improve mental health/self-understanding/self-exploration/etc.)
2. It doesn't matter how much drugs are illegal, one constant in human psychology is that a lot of us WILL TRY TO MESS WITH OUR STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS. It's so deeply rotted in us, that there are strong evidences (to my understanding) that agriculture started together with the production of alcoholic beverages. PEOPLE LIKE GETTING HIGH, and they will keep on doing that - if it's ain't legal, they will do it illegally. And without (at least somewhat) taxed and regulated products - these things are prone to be low quality with all sort of shit in them, and enrich criminals while endangering the safety of many more people. It is just unavoidable - there are simply two options and two options alone: either people take drugs legally, or people take drugs illegally. Never will the "problem" disappear just because you can get punished for that. Never will people stop getting in different states of consciousness.</original_post>

    <text>Some people don't do drugs strictly because they are illegal. If heroin became legal, more people would become addicted to heroin. Can you explain how more people becoming addicted to heroin is a positive?</text>

    <text>Actually, the amount of people addicted to it would most likely go down due to widespread normalization from legalization. Kurzgezagt made [a pretty in-depth video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJUXLqNHCaI) explaining why this would be the case.</text>

That's not what it says though. It says when given access to harm reduction centers like those in Switzerland, drug related deaths and crime decreased. Switzerland did not legalize heroin, they allowed it to be used under very strict circumstances.</text>

    <text>Who's to say the same trend wouldn't be seen if it was fully legalized? There would undoubtedly be a spike in the use of it once it's legalized but it would most definitely not create a significant amount of new addicts. In fact, the net amount of addicts might actually *go down* once people no longer have to deal with the stress of having an illegal addiction, would be able to open up about it and turn themselves around.</text>

Why would a spike in the use of an addictive substance not create new addicts? Should I point you to the opioid crisis caused by use of legal prescription painkillers?

&amp;gt;In fact, the net amount of addicts might actually go down once people no longer have to deal with the stress of having an illegal addiction, would be able to open up about it and turn themselves around

Again, the opioid crisis would tell us otherwise.</text>
