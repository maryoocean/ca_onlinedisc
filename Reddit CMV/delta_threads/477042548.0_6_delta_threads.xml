    <title>CMV: God could be either benevolent or omnipotent, but not both.</title>
    <original_poster>TaterTotsBandit</original_poster>
    <original_post>I have yet to see an argument that adequately explains the existence of suffering in the face of a benevolent, omnipotent God.

Provided God were both of these things, it wouldn't have created suffering in the first place. There wouldn't have been a need. To say that a God had to necessarily do something makes it no longer omnipotent.

I often see people say that suffering serves a purpose, such as bringing us closer to God or giving life meaning.

But once again, if the God were both benevolent and omnipotent, suffering wouldn't have had to be created in the first place. An emotion humans perceive as positive could just as easily take its place. If you claim otherwise, then that God is either no longer omnipotent or no longer benevolent.

No longer omnipotent because it can't get rid of a negative emotion, no longer benevolent because it can and chooses not to.


Edit 1: my opinion hasn't been changed but I've learned new concepts and been introduced to some novel ones, so the thread was still a success!!!

I decided to stop answer as most responses are currently bringing up free will, but the concept of that is for another thread entirely. 

I respect what others are saying, but i feel like ones conclusions about free will and the benevolence of creation is completely experience based. As such, I don't see a point in arguing over it as you can't change someone's life experience.

I'm still reading the responses, and will answer any that I feel I didn't address elsewhere in the thread.

Thank you all for your responses!

Edit 2: upon answering (I hope) every comment so far, it seems free will is more closely tied to benevolence than I'd originally realized. So I'll make a separate thread about that once I make my thoughts up on it (free will is one of those things that scare me, lol, so give me time pls).</original_post>

Have you ever heard of Leibniz’s “best of all possible worlds” argument?  Check this out:

https://www.britannica.com/topic/best-of-all-possible-worlds

The real fulcrum of the argument is the idea that human beings are incapable of actually imagining a world with less evil and suffering because of our limited perspective.  We erroneously assume that better worlds are possible, but when we imagine those better possible worlds we must be blind to how they would yield an even greater evil and more suffering than what currently exists.

    <text>If the best world that God could create still includes suffering, does that not make it so they are no longer omnipotent?</text>

    <text>No, it means human suffering is inevitable - no exercise of power could eliminate it.  Even if God could eliminate it, God might not want to. Leibniz uses the word "omnibenevolent" to indicate that it's not just humans that God expresses benevolence towards.  </text>

    <text>I'm trying to understand this.

I don't understand how this would no longer make them omnipotent? If they HAVE to make a world with suffering, how are they still omnipotent?

Apologies if I'm misunderstanding.</text>

    <text>Your misunderstanding is rooted in the human perspective that less suffering or no suffering is 1) a possibility, and 2) would be something that God would want.  

Even the omnipotent can't do something impossible, like making a four-sided triangle - omnipotence just means that one is capable of doing everything within the realm of possibility.  If we think we can imagine a world with less suffering, it's probably a delusion.  We don't have God's perspective on things so we don't see how what we imagine might actually create more suffering.

We also don't know whether God's benevolence necessarily means an elimination of human suffering.  It might be that God's benevolence extends to all of his creations, not just human beings, and to focus solely on eliminating our suffering would cause greater suffering across the universe.

We don't know these things, but it's important to note that Leibniz was working with the *axioms*, or presumed truths, that God actually exists, that he is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent.  He starts with assuming these are true and logically deduces that this must be "the best of all possible worlds", even if it seems imperfect from our limited perspective </text>

    <text>"Even the omnipotent can't do the impossible." 

Then they're not omnipotent imo.

Yeah, if you decided those three things to be your criteria, then the best possible world theory makes sense.
But the issue with that  is you decided on gods nature before you had any actual evidence of it.
WHY do you think god is omnibenevolent? WHY is he omniscient? WHY is he omnipotent? 
These things are assumed because of how religious literature described God, not because of how God was actually observed to be.
I don't like theodicy because it's not attempting to define god based on how god actually is, rather the way we're told god is supposed to be.
The entirety of theodicy rides on those three assumptions, assumptions we have no proof of.

That's my opinion on it, anyways.</text>

    <text>Of course you are right that the axioms themselves aren't infallible.  Leibniz was an 18th century philosopher, thinking in a time when Christianity was far more pervasive.  But in your post, you were really conceding those axioms and attacking the next stage of the argument.  You were saying that if God was omnipotent, then there should be no suffering, which isn't necessarily the case.</text>

I've addressed that in other posts. It's not my definition of omnipotent,  but I can entertain the thought that even the omnipotent could have restrictions placed upon them. So now we must address the benevolence issue.

So suffering is necessary for life, the reason why isn't important. But if life necessitates suffering, why allow it to exist in the first place?

That's really an issue of morals in my eyes, though. The answer on whether the creation of life was benevolent in the first place is too down to personal situation and experience to really be argued in a sub like this, imo. Still willing to hear thoughts on it, though!</text>

    <text>This is a ramble, but I decided to post anyways...

1) We are working off of presumptions that we have no proof of for the sake of this whole conversation — “God” is omnipotent, omnipresent, omnibenevolent, omniscient. 

2) We are working off of unspoken presumptions that out of all possible choices, numbered to infinity, we are stuck to one god for all the known and unknown that exists. 

What if it exists that there are gods who make gods?Then, out of all their power and knowledge, they made everything that the beings in their systems are ever capable of touching, seeing, or even able to contemplate? What if our assumed god is limited in comparison to the scope of what other gods can do in ways beyond our human comprehension?

This is a rabbit hole that has no answer. 

For us to even have conversations, it’s a basic need for our human minds to make and run off of assumptions. These assumptions that we talk about come from men of religions who have thought about this before and written about it. 

I personally believe there is a creator. The reason why has to do with the balance found naturally everywhere. The laws of physics that we know thus far that suggest for anything to function in our “realm”, balance is needed. Balanced is achieved through creating a range on a spectrum. (Maybe the range is decided on by the creator)

Balance is needed for human emotion. It’s needed in order for us to know how we are feeling. Thus, a spectrum of human emotion is needed. If we only ever know one place on the spectrum between happiness and sadness, we wouldn’t even know what happiness or sadness is. We have to experience all of it to know it. We can’t even have this conversation of “why did god create suffering” without the whole spectrum of human emotion already being in place. I have to have been sad to know when I’m happy. I have to have been happy to know when I’m sad. Depression doesn’t torture a person because they’re only at the lowest point of sadness in their life. It’s torture because in at least one point of their life, they learned what happiness was and currently don’t know how to get back to it. 

Suffering is needed. Range of spectrum is needed.  We’re all dead in one way or another without it. 

This is why I really don’t believe in a heaven or a hell. If there is an afterlife, I feel there must still be the full spectrum. Being happy all the time seems boring. Being sad or tortured in the same exact way for eternity seems boring. There’s no point. A spectrum was created and a balance was struck in all aspects of what we know as humans. We have swings from one end to another, but it’s needed to know where we are currently. </text>
