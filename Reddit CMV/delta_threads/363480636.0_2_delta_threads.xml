    <title>CMV: The War On Drugs failed due to the punishments not being severe enough</title>
    <original_poster>Blood_tree</original_poster>
    <original_post>The War on Drugs could have went significantly better had the DEA been able to request harsher sentences for distribution. Specifically corporal punishment and public executions for distribution would have made the drug problem in the United States negligible had they been enforced. Prison sentences cause people to disassociate the punishment from the crime due to their lengthly and impersonal nature and by contrast caning can be done in full very soon after the crime has been commited and is very personal and intense despite being on a whole less severe than a prison sentence. Public execution within a year of the crime is also a good measure since it will save money (we will be reducing the amount of appeals to one) and it will serve as a vivid denunciation of drug distribution and prevent perpetrators from reoffending.

    <text>Same basic logic but because it isn't as bad the sentences will be slightly less.</text>

    <text>Ideally there wouldn't be punishments for such a relatively harmless substance.

The war on drugs failed because prohibition doesn't work. Never has prohibition on any substance ever worked.</text>

It is far from harmless https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/brain-damage-seen-potent-marijuana-smokers</text>

    <text>1 - "relatively harmless" compare marijuana to alcohol, or cocaine, meth, or heroin and it is obviously the least damaging of the substances when considering the lack of true addiction, the relatively low amounts of carcinogens, the near impossibility of overdosing, and the fact that it doesn't get cut with possibly dangerous chemicals.

2 -

&amp;gt; The results of the new study, however, are limited. The brain scanning study was small. And it doesnâ€™t show that marijuana caused the brain abnormality - just that the two go hand-in-hand

The article itself even says "we know we have too small of a sample size, but we are going to say these correlate anyways even though we don't have anything of muster to back this claim up".

That article is garbage and the study is pretty trash as well considering that the study involved only 43 people who were all asked to self-admit to drug use.</text>
