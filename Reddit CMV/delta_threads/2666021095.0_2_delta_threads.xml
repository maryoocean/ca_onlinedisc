    <title>CMV: Francis Fukuyama's "End of History" has been proven wrong</title>
    <original_poster>Real_Carl_Ramirez</original_poster>
    <original_post>This post is partially inspired by this news story: [Bin Laden's Letter to US Stuns Young Americans: 'He Was Right'](https://www.newsweek.com/bin-laden-letter-us-stuns-young-americans-he-was-right-1844234)

Francis Fukuyama is an American political scientist who wrote of the "End of History". This concept posits that with fascism and communism defeated, humanity will now gravitate towards a gradual universal adoption of capitalist liberal democracy. Fukuyama also claimed that the "End of History" will reduce conflicts between nations as the people concern themselves less with ideology and national identity, as increasing economic prosperity becomes the main concern and smooths over other concerns. Thanks to recent history, I think that such a concept is now laughable:

* Regarding the news story about young Americans agreeing with Bin Laden, this goes to show that even within capitalist liberal democracies, this model is being undermined inconvenient truths, which are further spread by social media and influencers.
   * There is a lot of dirt to be dug up about capitalist liberal democracies (e.g. regime change operations, war crimes, atrocities against indigenous peoples). With the advent of the internet, these inconvenient truths are easier to find and therefore further weaken our nations through distrust, while more authoritarian countries can keep their dirt under wraps.
   * I'm not against truth and freedom of information, I'm just pointing out that the model that Fukuyama believed would triumph is actually quite fragile and easy to undermine.
* [Democratic backsliding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_backsliding) is occurring in many countries across the world, vastly overshadowing any progress in democratisation:
   * See [this report from 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20210914030243/https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/74/8c/748c68ad-f224-4cd7-87f9-8794add5c60f/dr_2021_updated.pdf) or [this report from 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20230314164628/https://bti-project.org/en/reports/global-dashboard?&amp;cb=00000).
   * There seems to be a perverse incentive to democratic backsliding, as increasing autocracy appears to be advantageous to leaders who intend to govern like a Paradox Interactive grand strategy game (i.e. to make their country even more powerful on the world stage).
   * Additionally, [multiple countries are experiencing a double whammy of democratic backsliding and political polarisation](https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/01/18/what-happens-when-democracies-become-perniciously-polarized-pub-86190), [which is also growing around the world](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/11/16/most-across-19-countries-see-strong-partisan-conflicts-in-their-society-especially-in-south-korea-and-the-u-s/).
* Living standards in capitalist liberal democracies are decreasing, which sows doubt on the promises of capitalism and liberal democracy:
   * See "[Living standards tumbling in Australia despite booming national wealth](https://independentaustralia.net/politics/politics-display/living-standards-tumbling-in-australia-despite-booming-national-wealth,15747)" and "[Britons ‘need to accept’ they’re poorer, says Bank of England economist](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/25/britons-need-to-accept-theyre-poorer-says-bank-of-england-economist)".
   * Even if you blame external factors for these problems, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the Russian invasion of Ukraine, these events prove to us the resilience of authoritarian systems in the PRC and Russia in contrast to liberal democracies, as declining living standards don't destabilise them as much.
   * The large-scale international resurgence of the far-right is [partially fed by legitimate concerns of economic insecurity](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/31/across-europe-the-far-right-is-rising-that-it-seems-normal-is-all-the-more-terrifying).

To conclude, while I believe that Fukuyama's concepts have been debunked by recent history, I can also understand why Fukuyama made such claims in the 1990s. Back then, he wouldn't have been able to foresee the problems that we're facing now.</original_post>

    <text>Not surprising. Marx could have, Engels could have, Lenin could have, Stalin could have,  and all of them did, tell us that Capitalism does not have an equillibrium state. Capitalism as a mode of production is in constant motion, with wealth siphoned to the top, and with a constant need for more markets for more profit. The era of imperialism was the last time Capitalism peaked in power, and now we are in the era of neoimperialism after the sabotage of Communism and its subsequent downfall. 

There is no peace in Capitalism. There is no satiation. Marx discovered these laws of Capitalism, Lenin applied it to our modern state of Capitalism, and they remain true to this day. 

After the US coerced the Soviet Union into dissolution, and with the "End of History" Capitalism continued on its path that it naturally takes, the path of Imperialism and expansion unimpeded. It grew and grew, until the rug was pulled out from under it with the crash of 2008. What prosperity it was. And now we continue in this process of growing contradiction, with another housing market bubble ready to crash the economy once again. We're already in an imperial proxy battle with Russia in Ukraine for its markets, we're primed to bomb Iran, and tensions with China continue to grow.

The era of Neoimperialism is coming to a head, Capitalism is reaching its breaking point once again. With such wealth bundled up in this new growing disaster, when it snaps the only way it can is through worldwide destruction.

There is only one solution to this problem Capitalism creates for us: Its abolition.</text>

How do you coerce a country into dissolution? Judging by the results of their votes, those countries were itching to break away. Besides, I thought what collapsed the USSR was a double whammy of 1980s economic stagnation and the Chernobyl disaster?</text>

    <text>The story you tell is the popular western story, so popular it might as well be known history in the minds of many. But this story is both inaccurate and simplified to uselessness. 

A country can coerce another into a political dissolution through espionage, sabotage through espionage, economic pressure, military threat. The life of the Soviet Union was influenced by a vast amount of external and internal factors. The external threats, being the US, would strain and influence internal problems, including the illegal dissolution of the USSR with an enthusiastic ally to Yeltzin. 

Now it is true that to get to the point where Yeltzin is able to dissolve the union unilaterally and illegally was caused by stagnation, but the implication of this is always used as a failure communism, as the "End of history" suggests, and that is simply not true.

The dissolution was a overwhelming unpopular decision that brought with it demonstrations to reinstate the union, suppressed both by foreign allies and by Yeltzin. The dissatisfaction with leadership and downward turn to stagnation really started with Khrushchev's change from a ideologically communist motivated system built by Stalin to a "reformed" command economy devoid of Communist ideology and dialectical materialist understanding of the world. 

Khrushchev wanted to compete head to head with the west, militarily and economically, where such a thing was not viable, combined with changes in how the economy worked lead to a stagnation where the USSR relied more and more on the west. This culminated with reforms by Gorbachev introducing private businesses and the entirety of Perastroika, which did not help the declining quality of life.

 During this time people were very unhappy with the communist party. It had lost its ideology at the core of leadership and was an administrative husk of its former self. In demonstrations, those who had lived under the communist government of Stalin wanted a return to the good times and growth in living conditions brought by him and his ideological leadership, not a turn to capitalism, as Yeltzin had done by taking advantage of the party's weakness, as some wanted to see any change. 

So when Yeltzin took power, he took this as his chance to reintroduce capitalism and illegally dissolve the union. It wasn't a collapse, as more of a murder caused by weakness in ideology of the party, leading to mismanagement and stagnation.</text>
