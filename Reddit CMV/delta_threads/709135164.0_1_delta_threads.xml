    <title>CMV: News Reporting must strictly be as neutral and factual as possible, instead of containing the reporter’s opinions and agenda.</title>
    <original_poster>Daberinos</original_poster>
    <original_post>Sometimes, when I watch or read a news report, I find that I notice many, or at least noticeable parts of the articles are not strictly of the information of the news report, but of the reporter’s opinions of the article. This leads to the reporter changing the meaning of, warping, omitting or highlighting certain parts of a report due to either subconscious opinion or conscious agenda pushing. Hence, many times have I read a news article and realise that I have been influenced by the way the reporter phrases the facts of the situation, and even outright puts their own opinion in the article. When a person who does not consciously make sure to watch out for subliminal messaging in news reports read them, their world views can seriously be affected. A good example is the “CNN vs Fox” meme where people poke fun at the fact CNN panders to democratic audiences and Fox panders to Republican audiences, and their reports of the same incident can be wildly different, and that’s where the opinions of the writer starts to show. Obviously I don’t believe that a report can be entirely without a second-hand opinion, in fact I think it’s impossible to produce a perfectly neutral news report. However I do believe that the situation right now could be remedied into a far better state than it is now. By having a opinion-wise neutral news report, it gives the reader a chance to developed their own opinions on the subject, and if the writer would want to give their view on the topic which I agree with, it should be segregated from the facts of the news report to warn news readers that what they read will be a third-person view of the report. Thus News reports and proper discussion of opinions can be properly distinguished. 

However, some people have told me that they disagree with what I said, thus I would like to know the general consensus of how people view this view.</original_post>

    <text>The basic idea of what you say was how reporting was done until 30 years ago, with it slowly shifting through the eighties and nineties. From 1949 until 1987 there was something called the fairness doctrine that the FCC require for all public broadcasts. The reason it was done away with, ostensibly anyway since it is hard to say that the large media companies had nothing to do with it, was because by 1987 the public had a wide variety of sources for their new, which was not nearly as true in 49' when the law was created. 

But there was also a change in how journalists looked at things. The journalistic thing that was predicated on as much objectivity as possible embodied no notably by Walter Cronkite, the man on the street who doesn't even have an opinion, it is one way of approaching news and not a bad one, it did a lot of good. But it is not the sole way it has been looked at. Up until and through the 1930's a far more editorial and sensationalistic form of journalism was predominant, it was attacked with the word muckraking, and in its worst form is called yellow journalism. 

The reporters from the 70's, 80's and 90's do not want to return to yellow journalism at all. They are attempting to approach it in a far more responsible way. The issue with the man on the street, objective approach is that it is not really objective, and was not adopted by newspapers and reporters for objective reasons. It was adopted first by newspapers, then by television, because it worked best for their advertising model. This was really only adopted in the 40's by most successful publications, yellow journalism was the norm prior to that.

Big corporations and advertisers knew reporters had to do their job, so a "I don't even have an opinion, these are the facts" idea made the most sense for everyone. But at the end of the day there are choices being made here. Objectivity is simply impossible. Just the facts is fine, but what facts to show, to emphasize, to lead with, these are all choices. A man on the street approach is naturally conservative, generally accepting of the status quo and entrenched interests, naturally. Such an approach for reporters is always going to view new ideas or even mildly radical policies with suspicion, and often any large reforms or genuinely radical changes with derision. The theory today instead is transparency. 

There is no way the reporter, or his editor, or the publication as a whole does not have an opinion. Separating what is primarily editorial from what is primarily news is important, not doing so has been the most serious criticism of Fox News or any more overt left wing equivalents. But in the end the idea is to be open with core opinions, basic biases the reporters or publication is aware color their view at any time, and simply an acknowledgment of where they are coming at the reporting from is the idea. To be perfectly frank I preferred the objective seeming, man on the street approach. 

But there are real criticisms of it, it does favor the status quo by its nature, and the current model is a real attempt to do things responsibly, I feel it has merit as well. I would be more in favor of returning to the old system, see them as more equal as ideas, if it were possible. It is not though, not with current technology and social media and such, the old way is essentially impossible as a practical matter at this point. I just see the current model based on transparency as the best path forward considering everything, that it is valid, and that the old way was valid, but that as splintered and intense as the media climate is today going back is impossible.</text>

    <text>I agree with almost everything you said, and the transparency theory is a very interesting way to look at the situation, one that I can understand. But yes, I prefer the objective approach as well.</text>

    <text>Thanks so much for the kind reply, I am glad it was helpful in any way. I hate to ask, but the idea of this sub is not that I will change your view at a fundamental level normally, that would be nearly impossible in most cases. It is only that if I changed your view in a real way at all, even a little, so long as I meaningfully changed how you think about it at all, would you give me a delta. As I say, I do hate to ask. But it does sound like I changed your view a little, and I was wondering about the delta.</text>
