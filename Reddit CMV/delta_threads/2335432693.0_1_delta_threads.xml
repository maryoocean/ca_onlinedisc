    <title>CMV: all (US) roads that are not highways between cities or states should only have a single, one-way, lane of civilian traffic or less.</title>
    <original_poster>Square-Dragonfruit76</original_poster>
    <original_post>The main reasoning for my argument is because there at this point has been consistent, replicated, research finding that the more roads you add, the more traffic is actually _increased._ It would be a rough transition at first, but in theory, traffic would be diminished if you cut down the number of roads and the number of lanes. This would be great for the environment but it also would be great for everyone driving because there would be less traffic. The lanes that are no longer in use could be used to improve our society in a number of ways. They could be made into trees or park area. They could be restricted to only delivery vehicles and/or public transit or emergency vehicles. Or they could be made into bike paths. And if all goes well, perhaps people would even be open to eliminating some roads for civilian traffic all together.

Edit: Again, to reiterate, according to all the current research, more roads actually _create_ more traffic. So if anything, this would reduce traffic, maybe not immediately, but over time. A lot of people seem to not have read that part, so I'm not going to respond to repeats of people who clearly did not read my argument.

    <text>I agree that there should be less lanes on US roads, but the one way system is an issue. One way roads can turn a wrong turn into a 15 minute detour where you could just do a U turn on a 2 way road. They can make navigating cities much harder, which could lead to higher journey times which would lead to more cars on the road at any one time.</text>

    <text>While true, it would work better on a grid city, I don't see that as much as of a problem. Reducing civilian vehicle roads should mean increases in public transportation, which won't have that problem, and neither will regular residents. Plus, it's probably been 6 or 7 years since I've been lost since the creation of GPS.</text>

    <text>Work as a delivery driver. You’ll learn quickly that google maps, waze, etc are all great tools but they’re not infallible, mainly due to the fact that they get updated every 5-10years, sometimes longer in rural places.</text>
