    <title>CMV: We should be focusing on toxic masculinity when talking about Will Smith's slap.</title>
    <original_poster>Izawwlgood</original_poster>
    <original_post>To be clear, Will Smith was responsible for his actions, which were inappropriate. This CMV is not meant to justify or exonerate him of his choice to slap Chris Rock. 

The point I would like to make is that 'attacking another man for disrespecting your woman' is rhetoric that men hear all the time, and this toxic masculinity is an example of the myriad and conflicting pressures men are under in society. Men are constantly told they need to be strong, to man up, to beat up anyone who steps to their women/family/property, etc, and at the Oscars, Chris Rock punched way down on Jada's disability.

Something I want to emphasize here - Chris Rock was not merely making an offhand lol ha ha funny joke: he is the driving creator behind this film [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good\_Hair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Hair) , which was about the importance of hair in the black community. This was a movie Chris Rock decided to make after his daughter indicated she had internalized social bias around black hair. Chris Rock \*knew\* how impactful his comments would be, and this was not the first time he had made these comments to Jada about her disability - [https://www.salon.com/2022/03/28/chris-rocks-history-of-jada-pinkett-smith-jokes-hair-commentary-and-disability/](https://www.salon.com/2022/03/28/chris-rocks-history-of-jada-pinkett-smith-jokes-hair-commentary-and-disability/)

Comedy is about poking and exposing and making light of things. Comedians \*should\* make fun of stuff, and particularly at an event like the Oscars, people \*should\* expect to get poked. Physical violence is not the appropriate response, and Smith definitely gave up a very profound opportunity to stand up for his wife without physical violence and make a mature and impactful statement about Rocks choice of jokes. Rock passed up an opportunity to make a joke that wasn't punching down on someone's disability, someone who is part of a community for whom that particular disability is really impactful. This is absolutely an example of people weighing their personal perception of how inappropriate a joke is *for someone else*, and deciding how *someone else* should have responded. 

HOWEVER, I also think had Smith stood up and made such a statement, the media would be lambasting him for "not being a man". We so very regularly hear people goading a dude into a fight ("You gonna let him say that to me?!" or "Don't be a pussy, do something!", etc). Now, we obviously cannot argue a hypothetical, so the point I am making is that the deeper discussion behind Smith slapping Rock is not whether the slap was appropriate (it was not) or whether the jokes were acceptable (they were not), but **why society has taught men that their worth as men is tied to their propensity to commit physical violence to defend women/family.**

tl;dr: I believe the real issue to discuss from this event is the internalization of toxic masculinity, not whether Smith or Rock were acting appropriately.</original_post>

    <text>So I'll begin this by saying we can do two things at once so it's not an either/or thing so much as a both thing.

That aside, and in the interest of playing devil's advocate, do you think your question, in and of itself, may be indicative of misandry? A man was assaulted, on live television. And your hope is that we'll say "yeah he was assaulted, but let's look past that and ask ourselves WHY he was assaulted."

It doesn't matter what events led to the assault. The assault was wrong, full stop. And our ability to look past the violence and examine the causes as the "real issue" is rooted in our belief that violence is more acceptable when it happens to men's bodies.</text>

    <text>I think you raise an extremely valid and important point, but I do not believe that is what I am doing. I am not seeking to justify Rock getting slapped, especially not because he is a man. I am suggesting that a significant contributor to the choice of violence is toxic masculinity, and that is not being discussed.

In a way, I would hold that the core issue is not being addressed because it is rooted in our belief that men must act a certain way (and that includes being the perpetrators and subjects of violence). I think what led to that is extremely important, and find it problematic that our discourse is NOT around why we hold these things to be true.</text>

Emphasis mine.

Well, hopefully I can change your view on the 'not being discussed part' because the role of toxic masculinity in this incident is absolutely being discussed.
