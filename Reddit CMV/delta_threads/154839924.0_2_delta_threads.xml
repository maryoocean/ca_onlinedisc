    <title>CMV: I consider the Nordic model the best socio-economic model to base a country around &amp;amp; the best compromise between the right and left</title>

I believe the free market combined with a social safety net reduces poverty which benefits everyone. High level of education, highly efficient administration effectively invests into the society, providing multiple incentives and angles of growth.  

People have trust in their government, in their administration and how their taxes are used. This leads to a high level of security; problems are laid off them and ultimately this leads to a high level of happiness.

Low level of income inequality, high GDP and PPP per capita, liberal laws, low crime, low corruption, good healthcare, great education, low pollution. What's not to like?  

But all this does not obstruct high profit businesses from investing and all that is asked from businesses is that they treat their employees with respect and pay them enough so they can make a decent living. True, most thrift-based businesses would be discouraged from investing but Imo in the developed country there should be no place for such an exploiting business style.  

My only doubt is whether such a model could adapt to a larger country because in all Nordic cases we deal with low populations, large areas and often, decent levels of natural resources and admittedly this does create conditions for easier administration and sustainable economic growth.  

CMV, thanks in advance!

Keep in mind that from the left perspective, the Nordic model countries still heavily rely on exploitation of third-world labor for much of their wealth.

    <text>They participate in a global capitalist economy in which the vast majority of natural resources and consumer goods manufacturing are done by severely undercompensated laborers in third-world countries. 

It's just to say that rich and poor in the world are connected and that some cannot be very wealthy without others being very poor. The Nordic countries wouldn't be able to have the quality of life that they do without being able to cheaply purchase the goods needed for that quality of life. </text>
