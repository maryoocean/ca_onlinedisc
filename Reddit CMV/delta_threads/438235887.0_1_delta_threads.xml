    <title>CMV: If gender is a social construct, then so is race</title>
    <original_poster>BoppeBoye</original_poster>
    <original_post>Let us take, as a given, that gender is divorced from the circumstances of your birth, that it is not a mental illness, and that there is no biological basis for what gender identity someone should express. Have I phrased that effectively? I'm trying to be concise, but I want to portray that premise correctly.

Why, then, should race be different than gender? If race carries with it "shared experience" and "lived experience", etc - that assumes that the only way you could understand what it's like to be a minority is to have lived your entire life as that particular minority. I'm not arguing against that, I agree that there are certain experiences that I could not comprehend - for instance, overbearing &amp;amp; strict Asian parents with exceedingly high expectations. 

But, if someone can change their gender or decide (?) that they identify as a different gender without having the prior lived experience of said gender, then why can't someone identify as a different race?

I'm not able to encompass all the variables which could lead someone to identify as another gender, but is it not possible for someone to come to the same conclusion with their race? What if an Indian man grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood, saw or experienced the same (or similar) discrimination as them, had minimal exposure to Indian culture; and this led him to conclude that he identifies more closely as a black man, rather than Indian? 

I would also like to cite Rachel Dolezal, who was uniformly mocked for being (afaik) the first trans-black woman in the public eye. It seems similar to transgender discrimination to me, assuming that there is something wrong with her mentally for deciding to become a black woman... Anyway, I'm not really defending her because that's not really in line with what I described in the previous paragraph (she grew up privileged IIRC), but the public reaction of mockery goes against the leftist belief of acceptance, by my perspective.

So, in short, why can there be no such thing as trans-racial people, the same way there are transgender?

    <text>So I think there is a pejorative being applied to the idea of a "social construct" that implies that social constructs are not real, or are malleable at a whim.  Social constructs are very real, and can be very rigid.

For example: France is a social construct.

There's a bunch of dirt and rocks and farm fields and buildings and people in north-western continental Europe.  Those aren't social constructs.  But the idea that those things constitute "France" is a social construct.  The idea of a person or thing being "French" is entirely a social convention.  The borders between France and Germany and Spain and Italy are purely socially constructed things. 

And yet, becoming French, or changing those borders, is not something which one can do on a whim.  If you declare yourself to be French nobody need recognize that, and if you show up at a an airport there and claim to be French without meeting the French government's standards of French citizenship, you'll be laughed at and forced to get on a plane back from whence you came.

If you, or even the French government, wishes to change the land area which constitutes "France" they would traditionally have to go to war with another country to do so, because otherwise their attempt to make that other place France would be forcibly resisted by the non-France government whose land it was.

So yes, race and gender are both social constructs, but that does not mean they can necessarily be lightly changed, or perhaps be changed at all.  Being a social construct tells us very little about them.</text>

    <text>I mean, culture is only one part of frenchness.  French citizenship is not a squishy thing like French culture, and courts will rigidly apply clear rules to determine French citizenship.

My example was about an individual's interaction with the larger society.  An individual who chooses to reject a social construct (e.g. rejecting the idea of citizenship but still wanting to travel internationally) may face severe consequences and their rejection of the construct may be ignored or subject them to penalty.

If you personally say "I reject the social construct of race or gender" that doesn't actually make them go away, or make society not want to impose them upon you.</text>
