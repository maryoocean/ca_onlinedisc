    <title>CMV: Some people want companies to pay a carbon tax, others do not. I believe the best compromise is an optional carbon tax.</title>
    <original_poster>antilisterine</original_poster>
    <original_post>There are people who care about climate change who want companies to pay a carbon tax - well they can pressure companies to prove that they're environmentally friendly and they can do that by paying the optional carbon tax. It's like they're saying, hey, we care so much about the environment, that we're willing to pay a tax that we don't even have to pay.

However those who don't care about climate change can remain unaffected by it - they can buy products and use services from companies that refused to pay the optional carbon tax. Also, as I've mentioned before, I don't believe that disadvantaged people should be forced to thank society for treating them like shit or be forced to help people with good lives whilst their lives are miserable - in this scenario, they have a choice. These people can choose not to support companies that pay the optional carbon tax so that way they're not thanking society, they're not helping people with good lives and they can remain completely unaffected by it.

It just seems like a win-win situation to me. So why can't we fight for an optional carbon tax instead? I see literally no problems with it.

    <text>The point of the carbon tax is to discourage or stop certain companies from damaging the environment. The companies at fault would have huge repercussions if a carbon tax were to be in placed. 

They won't pay!

Maybe for marketing purposes or if they under pressure from a lawsuit, but for both these options they will pay a fine, or give to a charity without the tax anyway.

The optional carbon tax won't be used by the people it's meant to target. The government will just be wasting time and resources by setting it up.

Also noticed that you said that some people will avoid companies that don't pay the tax. But companies don't have too pay the tax, so many won't. Additionally, storefronts aren't going to be covered by "we pay carbon tax " slogans. It will then become to much of a hassle for almost all people to check for.</text>

    <text>Of course they will, we see poll after poll after poll saying that more people are concerned about climate change so why won't they hurt these companies by refusing to support them? Then companies will be pressured to pay the optional carbon tax and look into renewables.</text>

    <text>I am concerned about climate change. Do I seek out companies that are better for the environment. No. A new way for companies to be better to the environment won't change my lack of effort.</text>

    <text>Many people do though. For skincare, many people look for words like "natural" and companies know to do that now. I don't see why it wouldn't be the same with an optional carbon tax. It will be companies willing to pay a carbon tax vs those who are not.</text>

    <text>There's a big difference between how much people care about their bodies than a problem they don't see in their everyday lives. 

Also another good point was raised that the carbon tax would hit companies that don't deal with consumers the worst. The companies buying don't care about the sellers environmental impact act.</text>
