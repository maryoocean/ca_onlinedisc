    <title>Cmv: Bernie is almost as militarily hawkish as Hillary Clinton.</title>
    <original_poster>eminemski</original_poster>
    <original_post>I want to start this off by saying that I was a huge Bernie supporter till about a week ago when I saw his voting history. I believe that, though he voted against the Iraq war, he voted to invade Afghanistan, and he voted for a bill that funds war in the middle East. He also admits to funding four different annual war spending bills over the past 15-20 years. He gave lots of rhetoric which I appreciate about ending the wars in 2016, and aiding war torn countries. Please change my view because I was so hyped for Bernie in 2020, but now I don't see how I can vote for someone who voted for bills that might kill more people than they save. 

Thanks!!</original_post>

    <text>So just went through his voting history. Regarding Afganistan I assume you are talking about June 26, 2008. Iraq and Afganistan war funding, Unemployment Benefits, Extension and GI Bill?

If you read that bill. It is a standard timetable stuff regarding military in mainly Iraq, and partly in Afganistan. A ton of funds went to the funding of security, economical independece and security training in those countries.

By voting no. The GI bill (money to soldiers, veterans, and their families), and the Unembployment benefits would be killed. Well they wouldn't, this bill passed 92-6. All of nay's were republicans. I mean if you are angry they got the 3 bills together to get democrats on board with the other Bills, then I agree. Politics is sleazy.

If this is the worst thing you got on Bernie, then it's really, really cute.

    <text>&amp;gt; Bush's AUMF

Literally every single Senator voted yes on that except two Republicans who were not present. Do you have other specific bills that Sanders supported that you think are particularly hawkish? This one hardly counts considering it had wide bipartisan support.</text>

    <text>It counts no matter who else supports it. Why would it not count just because it is bipartisan?</text>

    <text>You're making a comparison in your OP, saying he is "almost as hawkish as" someone else. Well, Clinton voted yes, Sanders voted yes, and so did everyone else who voted. It had complete Senate support and apparently wasn't controversial at the time, so I'm not sure how it supports your point, unless you are saying everyone who was in the Senate at the time is equally a war hawk. That's manifestly untrue.</text>

    <text>Well that is kinda what I'm saying. What did Sanders vote against on militarily that Hillary supported? Which wars did they disagree on.</text>

    <text>When Bernie Sanders was a Congressman and Hillary Clinton was a Senator in 2002, he voted nay and she voted yea on [H J Res 114 - Use of Military Force Against Iraq.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Resolution) Sanders has been consistently against the Iraq War, while Clinton obviously supported it.</text>

    <text>Didn't Clinton apologize though? In 2014?</text>

    <text>The fact remains that Sanders was always against the war and Clinton was not. That fact directly counters the claim in your OP. I cited the specific H.R. </text>

    <text>Right. But why did he want to invade Afghanistan??</text>

    <text>It was widely believed that Osama Bin Laden was there. The United States wanted to dismantle Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Your OP says Sanders was almost as were like as Clinton. Sanders never supported the Iraq War, a war started on false pretenses. Clinton did support it, even though it did not enjoy wide bipartisan support as the Afghanistan Invasion did. Therefore, Sanders is not as warlike is Clinton. There are further examples from when Clinton was Secretary of State that would support a claim that she is war-like. Would you like me to provide those examples, or have I sufficiently proven that Clinton is more of a war hawk?</text>

    <text>You have proven it. But I'm still curious why a belief that a terrorist lives in against warrants an invasion of the country. Civilians dying in Afghanistan makes this invasion not worth it.</text>

    <text>Also, if I've proven than Sanders was not even close to as war hawkish as Clinton, have I changed your view?</text>
