    <title>CMV: Muslim is the superior ideology</title>
    <original_poster>eltrutekili</original_poster>
    <original_post>First off I need to preface this by saying that I am a straight white male who was born, baptized, and raised Christian. I've held various thoughts throughout my life, ones you could even consider "Islamophobic".

That being said, I've read and watched a lot of content on the internet about the supposed "decline of Western civilization". Basically, it is the concept that feminism and white displacement is causing the downfall of society. This is due to a variety of factors, not limited to but including single motherhood, promiscuity, and drug abuse.

One of the major side effects of such societal issues is the formation of niche, extremist groups such as incels and MGTOWs. I'm not saying MGTOW = incel, but their core foundations are rooted upon the same premise; pure frustration.

Now here's the kicker, everything I am mentioning is fully solved within majority Muslim populations.

Allow me to explain. I thought about this a while back and was reminded of it tonight. I had just finished watching the UFC fight (Dustin Poirier vs. Khabib Nurmagomedov), and was reminded of Dustin's last fight. After Dustin's last fight, his wife graced the stage to show support for her husband. I just need to say, this woman was wearing an open cut dress showing off her...how shall I put it..."melons".

I got curious, being the testosterone driven young man that I am. I Googled her and found her Instagram. Her Instagram is filled with photos of her wearing very little clothing and receiving a lot of male attention. One comment, however, caught me off guard. It was written by a Muslim who had pointed out that Dustin allows his wife to post all of these sexual photos for attention, but nobody has ever even seen Khabib's wife. Well, you can find pictures of his wedding, but she is in full garment covering everything including her face. This individual then said that this is how it should be, that Khabib is the only man to see her half naked, and you know what? I agree.

Now about my previous statement; the majority Muslim populations solving issues which can be attributed to the "downfall" of our society. Muslims have, for a long time, enforced very strict rules which attempt to not only subdue but control biological urges that are rooted in hedonism, deprivation, and outright evil.

For example, I mentioned incels. Well, arranged marriages not only remove the societal pressure of having to find and court a woman. It also ensures that both parties are pure, and their pair boding has not been demolished by one night stands and "hypergamy". Not to mention removing a lot of the social anxieties around said relationships.

MGTOW? Most of them ended up in this boat because they were completely fucked over by the family court system, or "divorce rape" as they call it. Yeah, divorce isn't a thing in Muslim countries. Once you're married you're married. Cheat on your wife/husband? You're in for hell.

One more note; I also mentioned drug abuse. I watched a Vice documentary on ISIS which followed actual Islamic State militants in order to see how they run things in the various small areas they control. They were riding with one of the leaders through a town. One thing I noticed was that they had stopped to check on a man who was just released from prison for...get this...drinking alcohol. They made sure he was alright and that he was not drinking. They checked his place and everything.

You might be thinking, "this is anti-freedom!", and you might be partially correct. However, I believe this is more a matter of principal. Do you discipline this man for doing something that will clearly destroy him and cause harm to those around him, or do you let him be "free", drink until he has liver damage, and get into violent altercations while intoxicated? 99/100 times I'm going with the former.

Here is where the Muslim superiority really starts kicking in. If you look at major institutions, companies, schools, etc. They all seem to be towing this social justice warrior narrative lately. White males are at the brunt of most accusations, and are being made to feel guilty about all types of things. Things like slavery, patriarchy, etc. It seems weird to me that a white supremacist patriarchal society would allow this type of thing to happen.

The funny part; Muslims have a solution for this too. It's actually quite ironic. All of these different forms of oppression are far more prevalent in these Muslim countries, but you never hear about it from SJWs. Quite the opposite, actually. This label of "Islamophobia" seems to be some type of bizarre shield against any criticism one might have of said cultures.

Which is another point; Muslims would never take this kind of shit. They have their culture locked down so hard that the mere idea of even being criticized by the very people who claim to be oppressed by patriarchy, despite the fact that the Muslim culture is extremely patriarchal, actually causes feminists to rear their heads in defense of said culture. It gets to the point where they even claim that forced garments are "empowering" to women.

That's the thing though. While these women are forced to wear this apparel, there's one thing that is certain; they will never be accused of being raped because of what they are wearing. This is my final point. They've effectively removed male biological urges by forcing the women to cover themselves. This minimizes women being looked at as nothing more than sex objects, and also ensures that their husbands are the only ones who have a truly intimate and unique connection with them.

It is for these reasons listed above that I believe that the Muslim ideology and culture is superior to all others. CMV.</original_post>

    <text>Wow...just wow. 

You know, we used live EXACTLY like this, right? We have it even MORE strict than before? And you want to know what happened? Women were oppressed and forced into unhappy marriages.  People were forced to live a certain life with zero freedom of choice. 

&amp;gt; That's the thing though. While these women are forced to wear this apparel, there's one thing that is certain; they will never be accused of being raped because of what they are wearing. 

Clothing has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with rape. Rapists do. Women have been raped wearing revealing clothing, and modest clothing. Children, who are completely innocent, have been raped by complete strangers. Clothing will NEVER provoke a rape. That's like saying wealth will provoke robbers. It's the ROBBER'S fault you got robbed, not because you're rich. Same applies to rape, and ALL crimes.

I am a feminist. I hate theocracies. Most sane people can realize that theocracies are horseshit and ruling a COUNTRY based off a religion is dumb. But Islamophobia refers to people hating others because of the fact that they're Muslim. This has nothing to do with government system. People can criticize a religious government without discriminating against the people who follow that religion. Remember, Christianity is a well respected religion even though most countries back in the day oppressed people under the guise of religion.

Forced Modesty doesn't "protect" anyone. It only encourages women to believe they are at fault when people violate their bodies. I truly hope I can change your mind, because the idea that women should be forced to wear thing to "reduce" male urges is a silly idea.

ps. 

Since when were so *emotional*? That they were such *slaves* to their emotions they can't even control themselves around "promiscuous" women?? Do lesbians have the same issue? No. I couldn't care less about what a woman wears. I know not to sexually assault even If I think they're hot BECAUSE I'm a decent human being..</text>

This is an opinion I see parroted by feminists all the time. This could turn into a huge debate, so I'll just ask you one simple question - do you think it should be OK for a woman to show up to her office job wearing lingerie? Why or why not? If you contemplate this question, you might start to understand how clothing (or lack thereof) does promote sexual behaviour.

&amp;gt; That's like saying wealth will provoke robbers.

It does though. No robber has incentive to break into a poor persons 1 bedroom run-down apartment that they know contains nothing of value.

&amp;gt; But Islamophobia refers to people hating others because of the fact that they're Muslim.

Right, and being Muslim means believing in all of the things I've mentioned.

&amp;gt; Do lesbians have the same issue? No.

Male and female have extremely different biological mechanisms when it comes to sexual nature.

&amp;gt; I know not to sexually assault even If I think they're hot BECAUSE I'm a decent human being..

I'm not arguing in favor of sexual assault. I'm not sure where you got that idea.

I do, however, believe you are a decent human being. Thanks for your reply.</text>

Being nude in a professional environment is completely unacceptable. But not because men might get turned on. It's because underwear isn't included in a professional dress code. It creates a hostile work environment. A woman wearing a shirt that says "Fuck White People" would have the same effect, but would say nothing about male sexuality. People shouldn't show up to work naked because it's nasty, not because it'll turn on their coworkers or something.

Middle class people get robbed. People who live in bad neighbourhood's get robbed as well. To say it's a rich person's fault they got robbed by someone is assigning blame on the wrong person. And not all robbery is home invasion. Therefore a guy living in a 1 bedroom apartment could still get mugged.

&amp;gt; Male and female have extremely different biological mechanisms when it comes to sexual nature. 

Do they though? This is a claim I see parroted by conservatives. I'll say men and women approach sexuality differently, but women are just as capable of having high sex drives. Women can rape. Women can even rape men. Modesty has nothing to do with that.

&amp;gt; I'm not arguing in favour of sexual assault. I'm not sure where you got that idea. 

I didn't. It just seems like what your saying is that modesty=/= less sexual assault which is false. 

Religious ideology may help individuals on a personal level, but enforce it publicly is wrong and limits freedom.</text>

It's unacceptable *because* it turns people on. Also, Muslims have dress codes too.

You're actually using whataboutism to attempt to nullify my point. If you can't agree that a robber would be more inclined to target a person they know has $5000 cash under their bed, as opposed to someone who has $5, then nothing I can say will convince you otherwise.

&amp;gt; Do they though? This is a claim I see parroted by conservatives. I'll say men and women approach sexuality differently,

I agree that women can have high sex drives, but to argue that men and women are the same when it comes to sexuality seems anti-scientific to me. Testosterone alone should be enough evidence of this.

Also, yes women can rape, but the dynamic is much different. A woman attempted to rape me once, and I was able to simply over power her. This option isn't present for most women. Again, because men and women are different, as in men are physically stronger in most cases.

&amp;gt; It just seems like what your saying is that modesty=/= less sexual assault which is false.

Seems like a no-brainer to me, and I'll follow up with a question. Which do you think is more likely to make a man horny - a woman wearing full robes, or a woman in a bikini. There is a reason why Playboy doesn't have pictures of women in full snowboarding gear in their magazines.</text>

No it's not.  A naked man does not turn me on, but I would be extremely uncomfortable working next to one.

Statistically poor people ARE much more likely to be robbed than rich people.  This is why the windows in the Projects have bars on them, but rich people's houses do not.

Men are turned on by seeing a part of the woman that is not commonly seen.  In tribal cultures where women go topless all the time, seeing breasts is usually not considered to be sexual at all and doesn't turn men on.  In a highly conservative culture, seeing a glimpse of a woman's ankle or neck is just as arousing to a man as seeing a topless women might be to an American.  Men are turned on based on societal norms, not based on any objective standard of dress.  So if all you see is women in full burka, that will turn you on just as much as an American seeing a woman in regular American clothes.  Societies with higher standards of modesty do not see less rape - statistically the opposite is the case.  As many have mentioned, Islamic countries with extremely high modesty requirements have much higher rates of rape than western countries.</text>

What if it was like the most gorgeous man you had ever seen?

Well that was an off the cuff example to try and show you my overall point. Crime is an extremely complex subject.

&amp;gt; Islamic countries with extremely high modesty requirements have much higher rates of rape than western countries.

Check this out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_statistics

According to that Wikipedia page, none of the top 10 countries (per capita) are Muslim.</text>

I'm not gay, so no, men don't turn me on.

Sexual assault is even more complex.

&amp;gt;According to that Wikipedia page, none of the top 10 countries (per capita) are Muslim.

Studies have been done on this and rape statistics are higher in a lot of western countries because people are much more likely to report that they were raped in western countries, and a lot more things are legally considered rape in western countries (spousal rape, for example) which are not even legally considered rape in Muslim nations.  Women in Muslim countries rarely report that they were raped when they were, because women are frequently literally murdered for having been raped.  And even when a woman does come forward to report a rape, in many Muslim countries, a woman cannot give legal testimony, so unless there was a male witness who will testify (women are not usually raped around impartial male witnesses), it's legally not considered to have happened.  Obviously this will produce MUCH lower official rape statistics than the actual number of rapes happening.  More detailed studies have found that there are high rates of rape - the vast majority of them just don't end up legally recognized as rape.</text>
