    <title>META: Clarifying our stance on "Trojan Horse" CMVs</title>
    <original_poster>Poo-et</original_poster>
    <original_post>There has been uptick somewhat recently of posts where OP makes a claim that they do not believe in order to make a thinly veiled attack on something else entirely. This is usually done to illustrate a double standard they feel a certain group has. We would like to remind all posters of rule B which states *"You must personally hold the view"* and say that going forward we will be removing these posts on sight where they appear.  

These "trojan" posts are not suited to CMV because defeating the claim rarely results in a delta and merely unlocks the real view. There's also a lot of marginal rule 3 content that goes in the comment sections which probably should be avoided. I would advise posters to simply report and move on when you see one of these posts.  

You can talk about double standards in your CMV post, but you must make the positive claim you really believe in as part of that. 

If you have questions or more suggestions for the subreddit, I recommend forwarding them to r/ideasforcmv which the mod team is very active on.  

Thanks for making this place cool.</original_post>

    <text>While you are at it please make a rule against personal preferences like CMV Red wine is better than white wine or x^1 is the best x ever.</text>

    <text>I still think those would fit because someone could make an objective argument in those situations like The Avengers (2012) is better than Justice League (2017) despite being directed by the same person.</text>

    <text>How can there be objectivity when using subjective descriptors?

I mean, I could see it being argued one was objectivity more critically acclaimed I guess. But one being objectively *better*? I don't believe that's how objectivity works.</text>

    <text>Because public consensus of a movie is an objective statement compared to personal choice which is subjective. I enjoyed Avengers more than Justice league would be a subjective statement while, if thereâ€™s data to show it, more people enjoyed Avengers than Justice league would be an objective statement.</text>
