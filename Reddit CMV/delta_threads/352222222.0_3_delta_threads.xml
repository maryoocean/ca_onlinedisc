    <title>CMV: Privacy is actually a bad thing</title>
    <original_poster>Wagawaga2401</original_poster>
    <original_post>Around the XIX century, the concept of privacy was very different than the current one. Your personal data and identity would travel with great difficulty to a different state, and someone in a different country would find nearly impossible to know personal details about you, much less interact with you in a threatening enough way. That does not mean information was safe either; gossiping and the such were as rampant then as they are now; but thanks to how slow information travels, they were much less dangerous. You could start a new life by traveling in horse with enough money to a different part of the country, where nobody knows you.

Right now, thanks to the modernization of identity documents and such, that's nearly impossible; but I don't think that's a problem.

In the modern age, there are many problems where a person of public interest and/or hate has their privacy breached; death threats, harassment, violence and all sorts of things can happen. The usual approach is to try to disappear; to go back to a state of privacy; change names, appearance, address, and online identities. But all of this could be avoided if the assailants didn't have privacy either. 

It would probably be impossible to implement, but I think that if law enforcement agencies had the ability to minutely track people's activity, both online and in real life, many, many instances of harassment, crime, rape and similar things could be prosecuted, if not prevented. It would certainly be much more difficult to effectively plan a terrorist attack or mass shooting.

And to most of the citizens who (I assume) will see this, whose worst crime will probably be online piracy or drug possession/use, this won't be as much of a problem as it will be an increase in safety, not only from terror attacks but from common everyday thefts.

This argument seems so obvious and intuitive to me that I find it hard to believe that it's not the mainstream opinion. What is it about privacy that people fight so hard to defend? Is there a basic principle of social relationships that is passing right above my head, or is everybody else in the world a dirty criminal with horrible things to hide? Occam's razor points to the first one, and that's why I'm here. Please change my view.




EDIT: what I've learned so far:
&amp;gt;the government isn't flawless and unbiased, and privacy allows you to retaliate with much more strength than information about it. also people suck.

I'm going to sleep, so see you in a couple of hours, pals. ^I ^stayed ^here ^for ^the ^first ^4 ^hours ^so ^I ^think ^I'm ^good ^to ^go

    <text>Ultimately, privacy is valued purely because people value it. There are many things that people don't want known about themselves, as they would be embarrassed about them, or simply think they are none of anyone else's business. 

This leads to the second reason: we don't trust governments (and private parties) to use this information properly. 

If you are targeted by the government and/or private parties, they can use private information against you to find *something* that you're guilty about and charge or blackmail you for it. None of us is perfect. 

Allowing "fishing expeditions" against enemies allows for great abuses. </text>

Personally, I've always found this argument a little weak, since embarrassment usually comes from isolation; it took years of public information before we felt comfortable enough to acknowledge things like periods or masturbation are normal; no one will mind what kind of videos you watch at night if they know you know they do similar things.

&amp;gt;or simply think they are none of anyone else's business.

Actively trying to hide information attracts more attention to it; as in the [Streisand effect.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect) Maybe I'm repeating myself, but no one will mind where you were last evening if there are 900,000 other people having evenings in your city. The best place to hide a leaf is in the forest, after all.

Maybe I'm too naive to think of law enforcement agencies as impartial machines of justice and truth. ∆

But the whole point is that you can legally do the same, since all their information is as available as yours; so only someone with a much cleaner history than yours would be able to attack you; and unless they're really good at what they're doing, I doubt someone would risk adding blackmail/extortion to an activity history that's freely available.</text>

You do know that the NSA is collecting the data of everyone right? If you're using the internet, odds are that they know what you're looking up, and maybe even where you are.</text>

    <text>But (ignoring legal but embarrassing stuff) I don't really have anything to hide from them; unless they start going after anyone who downloads torrents. And in any case, I doubt any of my information has been reviewed by humans at all, due to the sheer volume of data they collect each day.</text>

    <text>Governments and people in power change over time. What's legal today might be outlawed tomorrow. Lets assume you downloaded a copy of a recent blockbuster, your ISP logged that info and in 5 years time a law is passed that gives the government access to all these logs. Then another law is passed which says that every person who has been logged illegally downloading content is charged with 10 years in prison. All of a sudden there's an arrest warrant for you because of something you did 5 years ago when it was completely legal.

Obviously I'm making a wild assumption but just because you feel like you don't have anything to hide, doesn't mean that someone determined enough can't find something about you and use it against you. Especially when it comes to big data where they piece together your online identity based on information and decisions that you might not even be conscious about.</text>

    <text>Well, I don't think you can be arrested for something you did back when it was legal, but I'm too lazy and sleepy to google it. However, your argument still remains true. 

What I have learned today is that privacy is much sharper of a weapon than knowledge, so a well balance of both is the optimal solution. I'm going to sleep right now since it's 12:11 am where I'm at. See you in like 9 hours, and have a ∆.

Am I being too generous with these? I'll never know, but I'm having a good time.</text>

Maybe not currently, but the point is that a hypothetical future government is certainly capable of making it possible to arrest someone for something they did in the past, when it was legal. They can literally do whatever they want, which is why it's our job to protect our rights and freedoms.</text>
