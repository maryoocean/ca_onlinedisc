    <title>The ends justify the means. CMV.</title>
    <original_poster>294116002</original_poster>
    <original_post>This was inspired by the "kill two people to save one" thread that was started a few days ago.

 This ideology is very often associated with terrible dictators and death and genocide, but I think that far more people actually hold it than let on. I very honestly believe that, if a result is favourable, the method used to reach it is very often irrelevant. A small note must be made here about probability: an action I take has a 1% chance of success, and succeeds, is *less* justified than if I had taken an action 
which had a 60% chance of success but failed. So I suppose my view could be refined as "in cases where the only variable of a set of actions or methods is the effect of said actions, unsavoury actions are justified ", so this is more of a philosophical CMV than a practical one. 

A few examples would be pertinent. **I AM WELL AWARE THAT SUCH SCENARIOS ARE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE AND AM MERELY USING THEM AS THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS, THANK YOU.**


* I believe that the Trolley Problem, that is, killing one person to save more than one person given that you know nothing of any of the participants, is justified in all it's forms. If I have to make a choice to kill 49% of the Earth's population to save 51%, the answer is the same.  There are only two actions to take, each have a 100% success rate, and the only variable is the result. Whether I am a passive observer or an active participant makes no real difference. 

* Rights and freedoms should be abolished if they demonstrably shown to have some net negative effect on society. If we created a controlled experiment to test the effect of freedom of the press on, say, the general happiness of the population, average IQ, life expectancy, and median household income, and find that a free press reduces every one of these things in the long run, than that particular freedom is unjustified and should be removed. 

* If it can be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that China's one-child policy will have a net-positive effect on society (say we create a parallel universe where the only difference is parallel-China does not create this policy), than the policy is justified, so long as the only thing we can change is whether or not to enact the policy. All future legislative policies *must* remain the same between the two Chinas.   </original_post>

    <text>I won't try to convince you that "unsavoury" actions are never justified. For instance, there is the argument that the Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bombings, while "unsavoury", were justified, because it shortened the war and indirectly saved many lives. I don't agree with it, but the evaluation of these bombings - whether they were justified or not - is not so clear-cut.

However, what I will argue is that *"unsavoury" actions have a high cost*.

Most of human interactions require trust. For instance, I go buy some bread to my local baker's because I trust him not to put sawdust in his products. Trusting people you know is rather easy; trusting people you don't know looks like a leap of faith. This is one of the reasons why we have laws: so that the cooperative actions are favorized, and trust can be established between strangers.

Let us look at the trolley problem. Let's say you have killed one bystander to save two people. If we look at this result, we could think it is a gain (or not the worst loss). However, you have established that *you are confortable with living in a world were killing a bystander can be justified*. As such, everybody could kill anybody, if it were for the greater good. And, especially *everyone could kill you*. For the greater good, of course, but it doesn't matter much when you get the bad end of the stick.

Now, try to trust people who would be fine shooting you if they believed they were right. Try to trust in a law when it could be put aside at any moment for the greater good. The idea that "laws are always to be respected" is perhaps a fiction, but it is a useful fiction, which should not be made light of.

Hence, I think that the notion that "the end justify the means" is, ultimalely, harming the trust that we need to live together as a society. For the second and third examples you give, a similar argument can be made. The government could restrict our rights for the greater good, but as such, signals that other rights could also be restricted - which can reduce the trust the people have in the government.

Once you factor this moral hazard, the evaluation of whether a particular end justify a particular means is much harder, and the balance goes against those "unsavoury" actions.</text>

Interesting. I suppose a case could be made that laws exist to improve order and function in society, and, while they are not justified *every time* like the perfectly justified individual actions would be, they, as an aggregate, contribute more benefit to society than the individual actions would, as perfect as they may be. Is this what you were saying, or am I reading too much into it? </text>

In the following paragraph (that was a badly chosen line break).

I had to think about it a little, but yes, I suppose that's another (neater) way to formulate my point. A law is predictable, so it is easy to take it as a basis for your decisions and your interactions (as long as you buy the fiction that "everybody respects the law"). Individual decisions based on individual interpretations of the "greater good" are not predictable. As soon as you agree that the law can be cast aside, its predictive power is greatly disminished.</text>
