    <title>CMV: Voting for Trump if Sanders loses Nomination</title>
    <original_poster>Dorozhand</original_poster>
    <original_post>Doing damage to the system and the bourgeois state by helping bring into power a candidate whose regime would be disastrous would be an effective strategy not only for the short term goal of getting a leftist into office four years from now and perhaps permanently disrupting and damaging the Republican Party, but also for the long term goal of revolutionary agitation among the working class to the end of building socialism.

It is plain that a Trump presidency would be a disaster. Not only does fiscal management of a capitalist enterprise not translate to fiscal management of a state, but Trump's record of fiscal management in the market is atrocious. Furthermore, his evident racism and covert white nationalism (evidenced by his nativist rhetoric in regards to Mexico and non-white immigration) would agitate a growing sector of the US against him and his government. Thirdly, his pro-bourgeois mentality and methods would cause further neglect and degradation of US public services and infrastructure and in all likelihood erosion of US power.

His presidency, therefore, if it occurred, would result in revolutionary agitation. The working classes whom he regards in contempt and the minorities whom he regards with vile malice would be primed towards the support of leftist candidates in the next election, which would in all likelihood be a democratic and left-democratic landslide and greatly damaging and disruptive to the reactionary-republicans' capabilities of fielding another effective opposition force for some time, possibly to the point of heralding a Seventh Party System. A solid south republican bloc ineffectively opposing a left-democratic New-Dealist state in the successful Sanders model. This stage on the road to socialism, of economic stimulus through public works and infrastructure, worker's rights, protectionism and a return to manufacturing, as well as the beginnings of both the vanguard party and directional centralism is vital in building the structures necessary to travel further on this path, like nationalization of vital industries, guaranteed employment, workplace collectivization, alleviating pressure on small proprietors, and agricultural mobilization.

    <text>Why not Jill Stein of the Green Party? She's exactly like Bernie, and if a third party gets 5% of the vote, they become a major party with equal ballot access and federal funding.</text>

    <text>Ive been saying this for a while. If you really want to "break the system" the best way is to vote for a third party. Getting federal funding would be huge to these parties and could be a big push to put a few more third party candidates in the Senate or the house. Unfortunately people are worried that their vote won't matter and only hurt the Democrats by voting green.  Which I can understand. But if it's a trump vs hillary  I'll certainly be voting for a third party. </text>
