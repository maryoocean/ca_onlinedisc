    <title>CMV: Donald Trump has taken concrete steps toward establishing a fascist regime, and "losing an election" won't be enough to successfully remove him.</title>
    <original_poster>MaichenM</original_poster>
    <original_post>I'm not here to argue whether Trump will win the election, I'm here to argue that it may not matter whether he does.

Right now, what is happening in Portland is what I've come to understand through observation as Trump "flexing" against the barriers that constrain him. No one has been permanently harmed by federal agents purely because that would be too big of a step, too early. He is normalizing the relatively minor violence of terrorizing protesters without actually charging them, and priming the GOP base that supports him to readily accept more severe violence against those that do not support him.

This kind of flexing has gotten Trump really far. He throws something out that sounds insane at first and lets people digest it. Then he does a relatively minor version of it. Once that is normalized, he ups the ante.

The one that worries me the most is his continuous teasing over whether he will accept the election results, and casting doubt on the validity of the election in general. This is coupled with the fact that he still has four months to look at polls, reflect that he is losing, and decide that he must maintain his power undemocratically if necessary. Even if he doesn't come up with a plan to do so, now, there will still be a two-month gap until Biden's reelection that is usually expected to serve as a nice buffer for an orderly transition of power. I know I've mentioned plans, but Trump doesn't need a plan, here. All he has to do is say: "No." At this point, all the resources of the federal government will still be under his control, and his supporters will have already been primed to accept violence toward protesters.

For the purpose of this view, I don't need Trump to successfully install fascism in the US. If he is removed through force, I will still consider myself "right" in the sense that a peaceful election was not enough. My view will be changed if I'm led to believe that Trump will lose the presidency without necessitating violence, or inciting it for his benefit.

EDIT: I have already awarded Deltas to some people who argued in good faith. Starting now, I can't promise that I will respond to everyone, but I definitely will no longer engage with anyone who argues with me on bad faith, or uses personal insults. Thanks to everyone who has presented good arguments.</original_post>

No they aren't.  There are numerous checks and balances that any President has to content with and frankly he would need the military on his side to pull off what you are suggesting.   Trump has been fighting elements inside even his own branch since he was inaugurated.  

Considering the numerous examples of general's pushing back against him for relatively minor stuff compared to what you are suggesting there is just no way that Trump could just say "No" about being removed as President.

You are vastly overestimating the amount of support that would exist from both his government and his base for bucking the constitutional mandated transition of power.

Your contention that all he has to do is say "no" just isn't true at all.</text>

    <text>So yes, the military COULD forcibly remove him. In fact I consider that to be one of the extremely likely results. That's why I said that I won't really be proven wrong if he's removed, but force is necessitated.

But as far as anyone BUT the military, I believe that the GOP would back him. They make a show of "whispering doubts" whenever he does something sketchy, but they are always there to have his back in the end.

So yeah, I absolutely believe it's military force or bust. And I worry about how easy it will be for him to call it a coup.</text>

There would be no need for the military to remove him.    Once Biden is inaugurated he would simply instruct the white house security to remove him as any other unwanted person from the white house that wouldn't leave.     

&amp;gt;But as far as anyone BUT the military, I believe that the GOP would back him.

What actions or statements from any GOP member in congress would lead you to believe they would support any action this extreme?    There are numerous examples of GOP members going against Trump for things way more minor compared to going against the peaceful transition of power.     The GOP is anything but in lockstep with Trump.

This is off topic to my post though.   I directly challenged your assertion that Trump has control of all the resources of the federal government that would enable such a scheme to where he could just will it himself by saying "no" to leaving.   You did not address my argument.</text>

    <text>The truth is that you cannot talk about Trump's power without talking about the unconditional support that the GOP has given him.

And it *is* unconditional. Anyone who would be willing to stand against him in any context voted "yes" to remove him from office, because of how obviously deserving it was. Surprise, Romney was the only Republican.

I do believe that they dislike him behind closed doors. I also believe that they fight him on the minor things, and not the major ones, because they can get away with fighting him on the minor issues.

So here is what happens, in my mind (most likely). Trump says "No." There is an entire congressional kerfuffle over it. Democrats say that this is ridiculous, as they do. Republicans join in with Trump to cast doubt on the election. Because the house is dem and the senate is gop congress is rendered neutral, and therefore ineffective. Trump writes up desperate executive orders specifically meant to prevent Biden from taking the white house. Trump finally goes out, but he goes out escorted by federal enforcers.

Now, this is all assuming that a free and fair election is allowed to take place in the first place, which is something I haven't explained yet, but I think it's an equally likely possibility that he could choose to compromise that well before any of this happens.</text>

Except that isn't truth.   Trump has been rebuked numerous times by the GOP and there are even Republicans planning to speak at the DNC.    Claiming there is unconditional support is baseless.

The federal government controls very little of the election process which is actually controlled by local and state governments.    How exactly is Trump going to corrupt that process nationwide with so many independent entities?

Which again goes back to my original argument that you are still not addressing about how Trump does not control the resources needed to pull off this kind of coup you are proposing.</text>

    <text>The most general example is the Never Trump movement within the GOP.  

As for some more specific examples here's a sampling:

Not to mention the failures of the GOP to pass much of Trump's agenda when they controlled congress prior to the mid-terms.     The GOP as a party is anything but in lock-step with Trump.</text>
