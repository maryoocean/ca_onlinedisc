    <title>CMV: I believe in Death of the Author, but only for some forms of art</title>

    <original_post>If you're not familiar with the Death of the Author concept, [here](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor) is a link that explains it (warning: TVTropes).

I have had many discussions with people about this theory in the past, and although none of them have convinced me to change my mind I am still open to the possibility.

**Where I believe Death of the Author applies:** physical art (sculpture/painting/drawing) and literature (poetry/prose). Since these forms of art are inherently more subjective, I think it makes a lot of sense to argue that the creator may be unconsciously channeling things outside of their original intention. Since all of these forms of art rely entirely on the creative vision of one person, any number of things in that person's personal history or life experiences can influence their work in ways they don't realize. I also think that works of art like these are distanced from their creators in ways that other art is not, and this distance allows for greater freedom of interpretation.

To give an example, Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* is often analyzed using the context of Shelley's own issues with her father. Shelley probably did not intend for this to influence her work and might not have agreed with some interpretations of the main character's oedipal tendencies. In my opinion, this does not make those interpretations wrong.

**Where I believe Death of the Author does not apply:** performance art (films/TV/theater). These forms of art are less subjective. They also function by a creative consensus between performers, directors, producers, etc., meaning that their vision and motivation has to be much more clearly defined. Performance art even comes with *documentation* of these motivations in the way of stage or script direction. In a book, if a character says "I'm sorry," it is up to the reader to interpret that character's motivations based on the rest of the text. In a performance, the line "I'm sorry" is often accompanied by directions in the script to indicate those motivations for the performers' benefit. Performance art is also much "closer" to the artist than physical art or literature is, so it cannot be decontextualized in the same way that those art forms can.

To give an example, television followings in the modern era of internet fandom are very eager to "ship" characters outside of the intentions of the director/screenwriter/performers. This sometimes goes as far as fans arguing that a character's sexuality is actually different than the creators say it is (e.g. that a straight character is actually gay or bisexual based on their own interpretation of the show). In my opinion, these interpretations are objectively wrong.

I suppose this CMV has two potential deltas â€“ either convince me that Death of the author applies to performance art or that it doesn't apply to physical art/literature. Change my view!

    <text>I guess it really depends on what you mean by the "author" of a performance piece. If you mean the screenwriter (which I think many people would), then it's trivially obvious that "Death of the Author" applies, and much faster than with books, because the Author is murdered by the production staff almost immediately :-). 

I would argue, though, that live performance is different. There can't be a *complete* DoA, because it is continually recreated. 

I think we'd have to accept DoA applies to films and TV and recorded music, because they live on long after the people who created it are gone, and a key part of DoA is that the *audience* takes on that role once the art is released. I think when you look at classic movies like The Godfather, Citizen Kane, etc., etc., it's pretty hard to argue that DoA doesn't apply. 

DoA isn't really about there being one vision vs. many (though many directors of films are *so* strong that I would argue that qualify even for the version you're talking about). 

It's about permanence vs. ephemerality. A piece of art that has separate existence from the author takes on a life of its own, and the interpretations of the audiences ultimately become the only thing that matters, because the author isn't there any more.

I'm not sure what you mean, the audience is still forming their own interpretation of the work as it is being performed. Death of the author doesn't require the literal death or removal of the author. It just describes the relationship between art, artist, and audience. Where the audience is in control of the message they receive, regardless of what message you wanted them to receive.</text>

    <text>What I mean by that is that the authorial voices continue to inject themselves into the meaning of the piece, and adapt to changing circumstances in a way that static pieces can't.

I'm not arguing against the idea that the audience's meaning is important. It's just reincorporated into the art *actively*, by the intervention of the artists, according to their interpretations of the audience's meaning. Basically, the distinction between audience and author is almost entirely blurred with live performance. </text>

    <text>I think what you're taking about doesn't really have much to do with DOTA. I think I understand where you're coming from, like a comedian reading the room and adjusting jokes is in a way taking the message the audience is receiving and incorporating it into the show in real time.

But while this might make an author more effective at conveying the specific message they wanted to convey, their work still has to stand on its own. The comedian can't make the start of the show funnier, regardless of their intent.</text>
