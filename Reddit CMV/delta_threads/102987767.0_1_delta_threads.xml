    <title>Christianity is fine, but the modern world would be a be a better place without Islam. CMV</title>

    <original_post>I'll preface the statement by saying that from a completely ideological perspective, I understand that Islam is experiencing the same thing Christianity experienced in the Middle Ages. Additionally, I do not think that Islam is an inherently bad institution, I jus believe that it's a driving force for far too many problems. Every week, we here about honor killings and suicide bombings. With the recent mall takeover in Kenya, I simply can no longer believe that Islam is a positive institution. I would like to believe that Islam can be a positive institution, but ultimately it's a net negative on society and the world would be a happier, safer place without it.</original_post>

    <text>I respectfully disagree. When you weigh the positives and negatives of Christianity, it's just as bad as Islam if not worse.</text>
