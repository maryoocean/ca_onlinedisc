    <title>CMV: Poverty may actually cause permanent racial IQ disparities</title>
    <original_poster>Laniekea</original_poster>
    <original_post>I know. It sounds FUKIN terrible. But there is a lot of evidence that is pointing in this direction, and I'm *hoping* somebody to convince me otherwise. 

First, let's start by saying that there is a significant amount of evidence that shows that poverty has a negative impact on IQ. Which shouldn't really be too surprising. Stress, lack of sleep, poor eating or exercise, unhealthy food inhibit brain function. Poverty causes all those things. Minorities are more likely to experience poverty. That part isn't really controversial, there is a notable difference between poor and wealthy children's IQ. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4641149/#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20children%20from%20low%20SES,this%20difference%20had%20almost%20tripled.

There's really massive twin studies that have found that IQ is at least partially hereditary.

On top of that, there's also evidence that poverty actually damages genes. 

https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2019/04/poverty-leaves-a-mark-on-our-genes/#:~:text=They%20discovered%20that%20lower%20socioeconomic,the%20genes%20in%20the%20genome.

And this is kind of the part where I'm hoping people can convince me otherwise. Because I don't understand that much about DNA and I'm hoping people can either show me a study that definitively proved otherwise, or can explain DNA a little better so that I can understand. 

My hypothesis is that multiple centuries of consistent poverty, slavery, abuse in Africa, wars in the middle east, poverty in India has done so much damage to genes that it is actually causing minorities to be born with a lower average IQ. 

I would love if somebody knew of maybe a multi racial adopted sibling study,  or a study that found another way controlled for poverty that found no difference.</original_post>

Ethiopia was spared from colonization entirely, and not for trying. Both the British and particularly the Italians attempted it, only to be rebuffed. And yet Ethiopians aren't somehow magically outperforming other African nations on IQ tests.

No, the more likely reason for this is that European IQ tests are culturally biased, which leads to other cultures performing lower. For example, an Englishman who writes an IQ test will find that other English people will perform better on that test than French people, and vice versa - a Frenchman who writes an IQ test will see better performance from French people than English people. Is it because English or French people are simply smarter? No, it's because the tests themselves are biased.</text>

Do you have evidence of that?

Do you have evidence that English people normally outperform French people?</text>

Ethiopia's [average IQ](https://www.worlddata.info/iq-by-country.php) is 69, below a number of other African nations who *were* colonized, including Guinea, Niger, the Congo, Cameroon, Sudan, and South Africa.

The whole "legacy of colonization" argument doesn't really apply to IQs.

English people tend to outperform French people *on IQ tests made by English people*. [Cultural bias in IQ tests is a thing](https://nrcgt.uconn.edu/newsletters/winter052/)</text>
