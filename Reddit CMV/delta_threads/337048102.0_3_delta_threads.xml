    <title>CMV: Some people want companies to pay a carbon tax, others do not. I believe the best compromise is an optional carbon tax.</title>
    <original_poster>antilisterine</original_poster>
    <original_post>There are people who care about climate change who want companies to pay a carbon tax - well they can pressure companies to prove that they're environmentally friendly and they can do that by paying the optional carbon tax. It's like they're saying, hey, we care so much about the environment, that we're willing to pay a tax that we don't even have to pay.

However those who don't care about climate change can remain unaffected by it - they can buy products and use services from companies that refused to pay the optional carbon tax. Also, as I've mentioned before, I don't believe that disadvantaged people should be forced to thank society for treating them like shit or be forced to help people with good lives whilst their lives are miserable - in this scenario, they have a choice. These people can choose not to support companies that pay the optional carbon tax so that way they're not thanking society, they're not helping people with good lives and they can remain completely unaffected by it.

It just seems like a win-win situation to me. So why can't we fight for an optional carbon tax instead? I see literally no problems with it.

    <text>There is no such thing as an optional tax. 

The purpose of the carbon tax is to encourage lower carbon emissions and reduce the damage to the environment. The only way for it to work is to penalize companies that exceed their allotment wit a tax. </text>

    <text>That can still be achieved with an optional carbon tax though. As more people support action on climate change, more people will support companies that pay the optional carbon tax and punish those who do not. Then the companies affected will look into renewables.</text>

    <text>No it cannot. If a company does not want to pay the tax they simply will not pay it. There is no reason for any company to pay an optional tax. </text>

    <text>Of course there is, what if it brings in more customers? Like I said, many people care about climate change now.</text>

    <text>That kind of market pressure is slow, and not likely. People shop based on what is cheap, not based on the political views of the company. </text>
