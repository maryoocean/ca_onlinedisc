    <title>CMV: In the show "The Good Place", the presence of both Tahani and Chidi contradict the rules presented of who ends up there</title>

    <original_post>#Spoilers for The Good Place season 1. 

----

In The Good Place, Chidi is shown to have deserved to end up in the "Good" place because whilst he tried to live a good life and do what he thought was right, he was indecisive to the point where it caused harm to his friends and family.  

Tahani lived a life of charity and tried all that she could to help others, however it is revealed that this was overruled by the fact that she did so for selfish reasons. 

Chidi's judgement was based on the notion that how he affected those around him mattered more than his intentions. He never meant to hurt anyone and tried to do what he thought was right, but simply failed to do so in practice. 

Tahani's judgement was based in the notion that her intentions mattered more than what she did. 

The two of them are in direct contrast to each other. One did immense good but for the wrong reasons, and one did harm but unintentionally whilst trying to do what he thought was right.   
If Chidi belongs in the "Good" place then the impact of one's actions matter more than a person's intentions. If Tahani belongs in the "Good" place then the intentions of a person matter more than what they do. 

So CMV, Tahani and Chidi do not both belong in the "Good" place, only one of them does by the rules proposed in the show. 

Edit - people have already made points on the following topics and I will not award deltas for them: 

* The high bar proposed in the brief presentation on how the system works, requiring people to be close to perfect
* We don't know if we can trust anything in the presentation as it could have been a lie by Michael

    <text>Aren't you leaving out one possible option? Perhaps they need both good and intentions and also good consequences. Tahani and Chidi both failed to do this. 

Now I feel like that shows no contradiction, but let me go further, any problems with this system seems to be the point of the show. Michael noticed Eleanor gets better and after she starts becoming good  he realizes there is a major flaw with the afterlife: people can still get better. If you noticed, when Michael resets their memories over and over again, every character acts in the same way until a change in what Michael does makes them do something new. This suggests that the show may be operating under the guise that humans do not really have free will, and that it's not their fault if they never learned to be good, yet they still can.

So the presence of Tahani and Chidi is not contradictory and even if it was  that's the point of the show; there are major issues with eternal torment. </text>

    <text>Discussed in another comment how whether or not the show would require both good intentions and good actions, but the other points you make do not really contest the idea of a contradiction.  
They support the idea that there are more flaws in the system but not to do with the judgement of intentions Vs impact. </text>

    <text>Well you said yourself that both my be required, and then you said it just seems unfair which I'm saying it is. That's the point of the show.</text>
