    <title>CMV: Mr. Krabs is a terrible business owner</title>
    <original_poster>CandyBroker</original_poster>
    <original_post>Mr. Krabs founded the Krusty Krab with am ambition of selling Krabby Patties and, in part, in opposition to Plankton and the Chum Bucket. 

Though Mr. Krabs has kept his husiness together through the years, thanks in no small part to SpongeBob, he is a terrible manager and overall business owner. 

He tried to charge SpongeBob and Squidward $10 for breathing (among other things), seemed hesitant about hiring his star employee until he and Squidward were almost murderer by a school of ravenous anchovies, sold said star employee to the Flying Dutchman for $0.63, fired two loyal employees over simple labor disputes, and has tried to profit off business avenues that either flopped (Krusty Krab 2 never comes up again, nor Krabbyland) or rightfully got him in a world of hurt (selling those rainbow Krabby Patties that turned all the fish characters the rainbow). 

He also blew $100,000 on a first date with Mrs. Puff and keeps all his money in his mattress. And his prized secret Krabby Patty formula in his single protection office Vault everyone seems to know about. 

Eugene Krabs doesn't have entirely bad business sense, but it is questionable to say the least.</original_post>

he has 100k to blow on nothing

&gt;And his prized secret Krabby Patty formula in his single protection office Vault everyone seems to know about.

he has spongebob and the secret handshake

I'd argue he's maybe a despotic tyrannical boss but the proof is in the pudding, he has tons of money (doesn't he swim around in dollar bills like scrooge sometimes, idk its been a decade), he has yet to lose his formula despite constant corporate espionage, he manages to make his presumably millions from a singular store staffed by two people 

I'd argue he's a fantasic business owner but a terrible boss and ~~human being~~ crab</text>

    <text>These are decent points. If he is leaving money out, openly flaunting his wealth to others, and is so attached to his money it pains him to part with it (ergo the $100,000 he broke down over spending) how do these indicate good money sense?</text>

    <text>Your CMV is that he is a bad business owner. His business is profitable. Plenty of rich people make a ton of money but blow it or are bad at managing their PERSONAL finances. His business makes a ton of money, requires almost no effort on his part and again is ran by only two people. He clearly takes the majority of the money for himself. Any money wasted is easily earned back. 

He flaunts his money because he's egomaniacal and can always make more money which is evident.</text>
