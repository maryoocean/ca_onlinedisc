    <title>CMV: The release of the CCTV footage of Michael Brown is not character assassination, but a vital component of the incident that helps all parties understand the context of the shooting and the state of mind of the individuals involved.</title>
    <original_poster>Thorax123</original_poster>
    <original_post>First off, let me clarify, I am not defending the actions of Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. I believe that he did use excessive force and the shooting should be thoroughly investigated. This CMV post is not to debate over whether or not Officer Wilson needs to be tried or whether the Ferguson Police is an example of police militarisation in the US. This post is solely to look at the decision to release the CCTV footage of Michael Brown robbing a convenience store.

Now that that's out of the way, I don't really understand why everyone was so angry at the release of the CCTV footage showing what appears to be Michael Brown robbing a convenience store. I see in multiple news sources where people have stated that the footage "'appeared to cast aspersions' on the dead man" or is a form of character assassination.*

Finding out that the shooting victim had just returned from robbing a store is critical information, because it provides context for the fact that a police officer confronted him (over something minor and unrelated like obstructing the street) and a violent altercation took place soon after. I see family members and other people saying that he wasn't "perfect," but it seems to me that they're dismissing the fact that he had just committed a crime.* The police officer may not have known of Michael Brown's actions, but it makes sense that Michael Brown would be more on-edge, scared, and impulsive after committing a crime and encountering a police officer so soon after. Thus, this footage provides a critical perspective into Michael Brown's state of mind and his subsequent mannerisms/behavior might have alerted Officer Wilson and escalated the encounter.

My view is that the CCTV footage was essential information that needed to be provided to the public. While it may have been misconstrued as character assassination, the footage is an invaluable part of the story that helps explain the context and actions of both Officer Wilson and Michael Brown. 

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your comments! I really appreciate it. My view hasn't really changed and while I still believe the footage to be relevant and needed to be shown to the public, the institution releasing the footage should have been more removed from the situation i.e. not FPD, but the FBI/DoJ/even the Prosecutor's Office. Additionally, the footage should have been released alongside other information which was excluded, providing a lop-sided view of the situation which served to inflame tensions rather than using information to allay them.

Edit: Thanks for the gold, stranger!

    <text>You absolutely have a point--  the video is an important piece of the puzzle of what happened that day.   To see why people are so upset, you have to look at the timing of the release and you have to look at what they're still not doing. 

The community has a right to see the police report on the shooting, the autopsy report, and to know the shooter's record.   Instead, after all this time, the police have still released none of this information.  

What _DID_ they find time to release?   The one video that makes the victim look bad.   

If the police were releasing all the relevant information, people wouldn't be upset.  Instead, they are holding back all information except the information that protects the shooter.   This destroys any illusions that the local police are working for the victim.

    <text>This is a very good point. I believe that the police should have released their report on the shooting and the officer's record. The autopsy report needs to be done perfectly in a case like this and while I agree it needs to be expedited, it cannot be rushed. 

In terms of the timing of the release, when would have been a good time to do so though? I asked this question down below, but I want to hear what you think. It seems too simplistic to say after the riots, because so far its lasted days and the need for information is palpable.</text>

    <text>Well, the DOJ and the State Police both told the local police NOT to release the tape when they did.   So, the obvious answer is 'when the DOJ says they think it'd be a good idea".    

My guess is that two more days of peace would have been enough, but what do I know.   Clearly, the day they picked to release it wasn't the right time. </text>

    <text>Do you think it would have helped if a more independent source had released the footage? Perhaps not the Ferguson Police Department, but the DoJ/FBI?</text>

    <text>Definitely.  FPD had a conflict of interest AND was stonewalling AND had clashed with protestors leading them to be relieved of duty.  Normally it would be the prosecutor's office that would release information, not the police who have just been relieved of command for their own city.   

I mean, the video IS exculpatory-- you have to release it sometime-- either to the defendant when he's charged or to the public to explain why he wasn't.  But that chief releasing that info at that time was very unwise.   </text>
