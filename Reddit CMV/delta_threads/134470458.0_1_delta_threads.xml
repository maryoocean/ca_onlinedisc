    <title>CMV: I believe that woman's nipples should be censored despite men's not being so.</title>
    <original_poster>keanex</original_poster>
    <original_post>I've noticed that there seems to be a lot of people that are pro-women being able to go topless in the streets. I've thought about why it bothers me and why I find it inappropriate. The big thing that bothers me is that women's nipples are sexualized, unlike men's, when it comes to the average person's view on sex.

I believe that a woman will never be able to go topless without causing a stir unless women's boobs, and more importantly, their nipples are no longer considered objects of sex*.

*I couldn't think of a better way to put this. I'm not objectifying women, I'm stating that the body part in question plays a role during sex, like a man's penis.

What better way to accomplish this than by de-sexualizing them via not censoring them anymore?  If women everywhere in the US (And I say US because in a large number of other countries in the world women going topless is fairly normal and non-controversial) started going topless it would become normal.  People would just get used to it.</text>

    <text>That's a good point that you make, but I don't think that the women should make their stands in public streets where even men don't regularly go topless. If you want to make a stand then why not do it at a place where it's common to go topless?</text>

    <text>Not common for men to go topless in public?  If it's hot out, I don't mind taking my shirt off.  It seems pretty common for me, and why shouldn't women be able to do the same?

Why not make the stand everywhere instead of just a few places?</text>

    <text>I don't regularly see men walking around town without shirts on, nor do I often when in Philly. </text>

    <text>So because it happens in your city it happens everywhere?  Surely you can see the flaw in thinking that.

What's wrong with opening up as many avenues as possible to desexualize women's breasts?  Why stop at a place where it's common to go topless?  Why *not* include everywhere it's acceptable for men to do it?  All it's going to do is help speed up the process.  People are going to be exposed to it that much more often.</text>
