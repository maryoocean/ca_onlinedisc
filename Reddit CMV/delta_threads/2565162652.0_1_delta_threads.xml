    <title>CMV: There is no living being whom it is wrong to feel love for</title>
    <original_poster>LaserWerewolf</original_poster>
    <original_post>I wrote an earlier post about this with a somewhat confusing title. I believe that this is more clear.
    
To clarify further, this is not to say that anyone or anything is *owed* love. I do not believe that. I believe that love should always be freely given. I am also not talking about romantic love. 

My opinion is this: even if someone has done bad things in the past, or intends to do bad things in the future, it is not wrong for this person to be loved or to accept love.

For example, let's say a man has murdered eleven people in cold blood and is planning to murder a twelfth. Should this person have freedom? No, because he would use that freedom to commit murder. Should this person have power? No, because he would use that power to commit murder. Should this person have the trust of others? No, because he would use that trust to commit murder.

But if his mother still loves him, even though he is a serial killer, does that harm anyone? Not in and of itself. And he cannot use that love to commit murder. If she loves him, but does not trust him, her love for him does not put her or anyone else in danger.

To change my opinion, you would have to show me how love can be harmful in and of itself, and not only in combination with something else such as trust or power.</original_post>

    <text>Mother finds out her son is a serial killer. He's already killed 5 people. Wants to call the cops. But doesn't. Because she loves him. 

He goes on to kill 3 more people before the cops finally catch up to him and put him down.

Instead of being in prison he is now dead.

Her calling the cops would have saved 3 people. But her love wouldn't let her do it.

Loving the serial killer netted us 3 dead people. Loving the serial killer is pragmatically bad. 

Now you're right that a mother is going to love that fucker no matter what. That is what mothers do. It's just how humans are wired. But that doesn't mean it's a good thing. It just is what it is.</text>

    <text>She doesn't call the cops, which means he has freedom. You have explained why it is wrong to give a serial killer freedom. You have not explained how love is harmful in and of itself.</text>

    <text>I would add to this personâ€™s comment the example of when people love their abusers. And point out that if a mother loves her child, her love would be the cause for a lot of pain, or harm, in the whole situation described above.</text>
