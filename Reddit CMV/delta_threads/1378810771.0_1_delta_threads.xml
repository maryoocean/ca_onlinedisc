    <title>CMV: I’m a bit of an incel who thinks women are shallow and only care about looks.</title>
    <original_poster>ITSINCElTIME</original_poster>
    <original_post>Hello! I saw that there was a post about an incel that hit pretty big, so if you guys are willing to actually talk to us, I think that’s cool. I read that post, and I came out hating that guy. He seemed like a dick, only caring about sex and treating women like objects, while I actually really want to have a loving and caring relationship with a girl. I value cuddling more than sex, to put it plainly. In fact, I don’t really care about sex that much, unless my hypothetical gf wants it herself. 

Anyway, one of my biggest problems with the world, obviously, is that women won’t date me. Something that really bothers me is that women take for granted so many things. So many women find it normal to have multiple guys perusing them, and complain when they don’t perfectly match their standards. Of course, I don’t blame them for that at all, after all, I’ll be the first to admit that most modern women are fucking garbage, so there’s nothing wrong with women rejecting a guy. However, I just hate how they are so rude and label guys as creeps for just having genuine feelings. If a girl confessed her feelings to me, even if I didn’t give a shit about her, I would really appreciate it and be incredibly flattered. 

Something I also hate is the hypocrisy of women. And there’s a lot of it. One of the greatest is how they condemn misogyny and abuse, yet always go after men who are abusive and sexist. Every fucking time, like clockwork. So many damn women have a story of their abusive ex boyfriend, which I don’t blame them for, but if they are so willing to date guys like that, why am I single? Why are assholes so successful, when literally all I’ve ever wanted is to love and cherish a girl? So many girls say how much they hate things that guys do, such as ignoring them or acting unfaithfully... so why don’t you just date me? I’ve always been kind and respectful to everyone my whole life, including women, and it goes unnoticed completely. I don’t expect to be rewarded for kindness, but it just hurts when people who are rude and disrespectful are rewarded more. Either women actually do like abusive and misogynistic men and are lying, are willing to excuse those traits if the man is attractive, or are just really bad at detecting red flags. All seem likely and none are very nice. 

Also, it bothers me that so many women are not virgins. Like, I’m 17, and I’ll be 18 relatively soon. Are there any virgin girls my age left? I know sex your first time supposedly sucks, but I want my first time to also be her first time, and for us both to be teenagers. I’ve fantasized about that a lot. Probably won’t happen though.

Also, I’ll get some arguments out of the way here:
-Why a women want to date you if you are a incel??
Ive never told anyone about my thoughts in real life. Just on this anonymous throwaway account on reddit. And no, they can’t sniff my inceldom. I’m very kind to women irl, if I even talk to them at all.
-Why don’t you just take a shower and go to the gym?
I have good hygiene and while I’m not in perfect shape, I’ve started going to the gym with a friend. Surprisingly enough, we aren’t all neckbeard caricatures.

I could probably say more, but that’s most of it. If I think of more I’ll add it later. Can you guys change my mind? I realize that women can’t read my mind to tell I’m an incel, but maybe they would like me more if I wasn’t. Just maybe. Don’t want to be a white Knight or anything.

EDIT: Forgot to mention this: Most girls are boring. I could never date a girl who doesn’t share my interests, or isn’t at the very least willing to try out the things I like. I mean, what do most girls like nowadays? Tiktok? Painting there fingernails? Idk</original_post>

    <text>Why do you actually want a relationship with a girl? You’ve really just insulted women as a whole this entire thread while still arguing that you so badly want a relationship and would treat a girlfriend so well and respect her so much. People generally want a partner that wants to date them, not just a generic member of their gender. 

Most women aren’t going to feel special because you’ll date them since their female, moderately good looking, a virgin, and give you the time of day. You need to get to know them and find someone you want to date because they’re funny, smart, kind hearted, have similar interests something about who they are as a person. They also have to like something unique about who you are as a person, not disrespectful isn’t enough.</text>

    <text>First of all, I hate most people. I just don’t want to date guys, and I have friends who are males so I hate guys a little less. Most people are horrible monsters though. 

And, I think if women were to look past my looks and liked quieter guys, I think I have a lot to offer. I guess I don’t know what girls like though.</text>

    <text>Girls all like different things because they’re different people. Until you treat them like individuals it doesn’t really matter what you have to offer. If the otherwise perfect guy showed up on my doorstep but the only reason he was there is he thought I was pretty and less of a bitch that most girls I wouldn’t be interested.</text>

    <text>I do treat them as individuals. Are you really gonna deny that most girls aren’t big fans of anime, video games, and tabletop gaming? Especially compared to guys?</text>

    <text>I’m a woman and a huge fan of tabletop gaming as are almost all of my female friends, I have a girls only group that plays weekly during non pandemic times. One of my best girl friends loves video games and regularly kicks her husbands ass at whatever they’re latest purchase is. I personally know very few anime fans at all. Sure some interests are more common with men but there are still lots of women that tend to enjoy them.</text>

    <text>even girls who like stuff like that would probably hate me, which is the saddest part.</text>

    <text>You keep dealing in non-absolutes. For example you added to your OP that "most girls are boring" followed up with "what do most girls like nowadays"? Hence you are admitting that you don't actually know what girls are interested in. How can you conclude to know what women are like without having really understood or befriended any? How do you know this type of girl has a ton of guys going for them? How do you they would probably hate you? Assuming you're referring to your own attitude toward women, the solution is simple: become the type of person whose mindset would not make them hate you.

As many people have said in this thread, the best way for you to change your view is to first work on yourself. Through therapy, through building on your confidence and not hating yourself, and eventually through making friends of both genders. You need to stop assuming you know things. I don't know how many times you've been rejected but it's clear that those instances had a large negative effect on your confidence and defined your worldview, even if it was just a few times. The way to combat that is to work on yourself and become the type of person to keep persisting and being less afraid of rejection. But unless you're willing to not let those rejections define your view of women as a whole, your view isn't really going to be changed.</text>
