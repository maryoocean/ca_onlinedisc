    <title>CMV: American cities are terribly designed and administered compared with European cities.</title>
    <original_poster>bostoninwinston</original_poster>
    <original_post>Most American cities are terrible compared to European ones. I'm not talking about big cities like NYC or SF- I mean the typical- the average- American city- is just awful by any objective comparison. You can go to out of the way cities in Italy or France, Germany or Belgium, and they build places as though their great-grandchildren would be proud to live there. Here, the average city has no city center, major monuments, or sense of history. In the US. there are few places to gather. The social life of American cities is incomparably lifeless compared to European cities. Our Cities are heavily segregated by race and economic class in the way European cities aren't. The architecture here is mostly corporatist modernism, and looks cookie-cutter. It quickly gets dated in the way the art of European cities don't. People here have to get around by car, and as a result are fatter and live shorter lives than the average European. Our unhealthiness contributes to our under-productivity. The average European city is vastly more productive than the average American one â€“ despite Europeans having dramatically more benefits, time off, vacations in, and shorter work hours on average. We damage our environment far more readily than European cities do. Our cities are designed often in conflict with the rule areas that surround them, whereas many European cities are built integrated into their environment. We spend more money on useless junk thank Europeans do. Our food isn't as good quality. Our water is often poisoned with lead and arsenic, and our storm drainage systems are easily overrun compared to European water management systems.  European cities are managing rising seas and the problems related to smog far better than American cities are. 

I can't think of a single way in which American cities are broadly speaking superior to European ones. Change my view.</original_post>

    <text>Every point you make has a counter.

Our cities are car accessible, European cities are terrible to drive in.

We don't have to walk everywhere.

Our buildings are practical and cheap to build and maintain.

We live next door to people who look like us, speak our language, and have similar hobbies.

We have much more variable weather than European cities, which would be utterly destroyed by something like a hurricane.

Our food is half the price of European food and our diets are what we choose them to be.

Our drinking water is much safer than water in most of Europe, I have no idea where you came up with that...

Your points are just subjective opinions.</text>

    <text>It's called Change My View- Not "Here's my justification for every assertion I believe." Yes- you're right. These are subjective opinions. Don't you want to earn that delta?

Edit- It was rightly pointed out that I was insufficiently defending my point of view. I asked for Objectivity. Here's some: 
They live longer and healthier: http://gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/mbd/life_expectancy/tablet/atlas.html
They have more vacation days than we do: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/06/08/countries-most-vacation-days/2400193/
We don't get to walk much of anywhere. As a result of things like Jay Walking Laws, which don't exist in Europe as I understand it, we've made it illegal to get around many cities on foot. This helps contribute to our over-imprisonment problem, which far-surpasses Europe. http://www.prisonstudies.org/map/europe

Our buildings are impractical, I would argue, because single-use zoning in the USA makes it far more difficult to change a building from a residence to commercial, or single family to multifamily uses. This is very impractical, because it directly hampers adapting uses in response to changing economic and social conditions.

The idea that Americans live near more people they like than Europeans has no support. I don't think Americans get along with neighbors better than Europeans do, but I couldn't find any contrary evidence. In my experience, Europeans dont find it difficult to find people who share interests and hobbies. We certainly vote less than Europeans do. http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/15/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/ and are in general less likely to be involved in politics. With their extra vacation time and shorter workdays, I bet they have more time for hobbies and friends too. 

We have generally worse water than Europeans.

That is what you said in the OP. If you now see that all your points were totally subjective then you need to give this person a delta. 

On the other hand, If you refuse to defend your view it becomes very hard for anyone to develop a position to change it. A delta is not a carrot you wave in front of someone to get them to do tricks for you.</text>
