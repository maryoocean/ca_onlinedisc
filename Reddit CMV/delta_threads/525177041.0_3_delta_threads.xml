    <title>CMV: Pride parades should have less NSFW content</title>
    <original_poster>punmaster29</original_poster>
    <original_post>To preface, I'm bisexual and I love pride month and pride parades. However, I think that the amount of inappropriate content impedes some of the intent behind pride. 

To me, pride is about celebrating the LGBT+ community and promoting acceptance and understanding. It's about not being ashamed of who we love and what we identify as, and being able to share that with the world. 

I think the parade would ideally be a great place to bring our families, to show parents and children how incredible and talented the community is. I'm not out to my family, but bringing them to Pride would be a great start towards warming them up to accept me. But generally given the amount of public nudity and sexual inappropriateness at Pride, this is pretty much out of the question. 

In order to be more inclusive and celebrate love with as many people as possible, I think pride parades should tone down the sexual undertones and focus more on the concepts of love, pride, celebration, and acceptance. </original_post>

    <text>It is possible for it to be a place for families AND for sexual openness. 

Im from the Caribbean, and carnival is a big thing in my culture. You could definitely say its sexually open \- we dress up in masquerade costumes \(kind of like bikinis with a lot of extra decorations\) and wine on each other all day long. It doesn't matter if you're big or small, you can wear mas costumes and wine and no\-one will judge. It's just what we do, and many see it as very sexually provocative. But its also a place for families. We bring our kids and parents and uncles. Ive been to carnival with my aunts and little cousins before. Its a celebration of culture.

I think Pride could be like that too. I shit you not, I went to Pride in Amsterdam with both of my parents and my little sister, and we had an amazing time dancing \(my mum especially loved it\). Not long later, my sister came out to us because she finally had the courage to do so. I think theres something for everyone at Pride in the same way as carnival, it doesn't have to revolve around sex if you don't want it to.</text>

The carnival example is a fair point, that didn't really occur to me. I guess I was speaking from my own discomfort, as sexuality and sex are both taboo topics and heavily repressed in my culture.</text>

That gets to the heart of the issue. Much of western culture is sexually repressed, but just because we are doesn't somehow mean outwards sexuality is wrong or inappropriate. I definitely think we could stand to get a little more comfortable with our own bodies.</text>

natural != justifiable in all situations  
Lots of things are natural. Rape is natural. That doesn't mean it ought to be perpetrated on people in a civilized society. The same goes for other sexual acts and forms of sexual expression. If done inappropriately they can be harmful. When do you sexually explicit things in public spaces you don't know who's going to see it, you don't know what their past experiences may be, and you don't know how it might impact them in the future. Particularly with children. I've seen photographs of men in BDSM harnesses urinating in each others' mouths on the street during a Pride Parade. This sort of thing is disorderly and unacceptable. </text>
